Given a corpus of two English sentences with their translation in Latin below.

\begin{itemize}
	\item [\textbf{English}] this course
	\item [\textbf{Latin}]   hoc utique
	\item [\textbf{English}] Text processing
	\item [\textbf{Latin}]   Textus processus
\end{itemize}

Build your lexical translation model (IBM Model 1) and show each training (expectation maximization) stepâ€™s computation. 
Assume that the model only trains for two iterations.

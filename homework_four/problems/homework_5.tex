What is the machine translation issues? Please provide explanations and examples for each of the cases.

\subsection*{Answer}
The problem with machine translation are lexical translation, and reordering. 

\subsubsection*{Lexical Translation}  
Lexical Divergence\footnote{Ambiguities with the language.} , cause words that could mean different things to produce erroneous outcomes within machine translation. 
The parts of speech that exposes this most are going to be the Homonym\footnote{each of two or more words having the same spelling or pronunciation but different meanings and origins.} and Polysemous\footnote{the coexistence of many possible meanings for a word or phrase.}.

\subsection*{Reordering}
Local reordering deals with the order of operations of the part of speech. 
While long distance reordering deals with the complete syntactic parts of speech.

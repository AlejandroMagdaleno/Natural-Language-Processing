%Problem

Information is getting transferred at an astonishing rate.
Within this mass of information a huge part of that is political.
With all of this political information that is getting traversed we need now more than ever tools to understand a body of text outside of the information that is given by the author or the outlet.
%Background

There has been very little data on the analysis of news articles and this has allowed publications to get sloppy. 
Whilst we are mean to "trust" the journalist by their honor we must not rely simple on that to keep them honest.
After Branzburg c. Hayes(1972) the supreme court allowing journalist to refuse to testify before a grand jury, there hasn't been much need of having to verify sources of information. 
This has lead news stations being more loose and thus becoming more subjective to their own aims instead of facts of the world around them.
%Objective

What we want to do is to be the first of many tools to process news on a large scale basis.
We want to collect data points for news articles that are tangible and accessible.
The journey to get where news data is where it needs to be will be a long one but this report should be the first of many that start to use Natural Language Processing for such work.

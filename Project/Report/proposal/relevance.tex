The relevance of the proposed study of algorithmically detecting the origin of new articles can be linked to the analysis of bias and unearthing it within the large repertoire that we are given with our selection of where to find and digest news of the world around us. 
If we can find out the bias this should be the first step and shifting through to the truth in these sometimes lengthy articles that share more about the authors voice than the subject matter at hand. 
Doing this will save a great deal for anyone that just wants the facts fast and will allow those individuals to regain parts of their lives that would have been ultimately lost other wise.

	\frametitle{Purpose of the conducted research?}
	Our goal was to determine if we can find a way to classify the origin of news articles through modern Natural Language Processing Techniiques and to what extent can we achieve such a goal.
	We were able to do this by algorithmically dectecting the simularity of the documents.
	Thus we were able to build classification models to determine what news outlet a given body of text has come from.

An auxiliary goal will be to tell which of the author has written the given body of text. 
Another auxiliary goal will be the level of accuracy the model will have. 
Aiming to be better the 70\% to begin with and gradually increasing the threshold. 
If we pass the 95\% mark we will considered the first auxiliary goal mentioned which is to classify the authors voice in a given piece.

So far the biggest challenge has been the dataset. 
Collection and cleansing of the data has been a difficult thing to do. 
The main issue with this is that there were no pre-existing data set that had the data in the format that we needed to build such a classification model and with our want to have relevant and up to date articles.
We still need some more labels when pulling the data to reach some of the other auxiliary goals that were mentioned in the proposal. So getting the author name the title of the article and such would allow use to gather more information from our data set.
Creating a working model to our standards has not posed a great challenge, currently we are getting 72\% with very limited data and we expect this to increase with more data.
Going forward we can see the finish line and we will simply polish the processes if we have more time left over.

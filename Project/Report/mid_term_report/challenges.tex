So far the biggest challenge has been the dataset. 
Collection and cleansing of the data has been a difficult thing to do. 
The main issue is that there were no pre-existing data set that had the data in the format that we needed to build such a classification model. 
So we are currently building our own which allows for greater flexibility when building the models but the start up cost are significant. 
The process isn't ironed out completely but its working currently and is a good base to start from. 
We still need some more labels when pulling the data to reach some of the other auxiliary goals that were mentioned in the proposal. 
We are helped with the Tensor Flow library automatically labeling the data from the directories. 
Getting the title of the article and assigning it to the file name would allow us to gather more information from our data set.
Creating a working model to our standards has not posed a great challenge, currently we are getting 97\% with very limited data but as said in the methods these results could be gilded with our small data set.  
Going forward we can see the finish line and we will polish the processes if we have more time left over.

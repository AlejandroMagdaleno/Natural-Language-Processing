The goal of this research is to build a classification model to determine where bodies of text originate from using currently a Sequential Model from the Keras Library. 
The progress that we have had so far is multifold. 
For the data, we have been able to write a script that allows us to get 40-60 articles at a time and strip them of only their stories and outputting that data into a folder properly labeled with the classes that we need. 
So the current article count is around 120 and the token count is around $124,998$ and will grow at the pace that new articles are produced. 
We have a pipeline for creating a vocabulary and frequency count for the current data set. With this pipeline that directly helps us create vectors our data and then use that information for our sequential model.
Our loss values with this model are ~20\% and the Accuracy that the model is achieving now with this limited data is 97\%.

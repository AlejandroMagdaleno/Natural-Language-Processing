For this project, we want variety in the data that we extract in order to detect the best patterns in the data. Our data will consists of many different transcripts from several targeted news stations on top of news articles, and posssible transcribed voice recordings of news broadcasts. We could be set with just using the transcriptions already provided on news station websites but variety is key in data and bringing in articles and captioned voice recordings should ideally start giving the model more to go off of in terms of patterns that it can detect. There won't be much need for data modification in this case besides taking in voice recording and captioning them and many different news station websites already provide their own transcriptions. One example is the website, https://transcripts.cnn.com/, where cnn provides all their show transcripts online and many other stations also provide this.

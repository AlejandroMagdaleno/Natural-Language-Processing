Democrats looked almost defeated (and/or tired).\n\nDuring the final vote, it was silent. When Burr voted “guilty” - it was a surprise to many in the room. Audible “wow” and rumblings were heard in the chamber. Burr sat in his seat frozen, serious and red-faced the remainder of the time.\n\nSenator Whitehouse rocked back in his seat, surprised at Burr’s vote - as if it gave him a momentary glimmer of hope that Trump could be convicted in the end. The rest of the time he nervously fidgeted with his mask.\n\nSchumer glared at McConnell when the minority leader voted to acquit Trump.\n\nThune, who ultimately voted not guilty, looked visibly uncomfortable the entire time. His head was in his hands, and he clasped and unclasped his hands several times. He shook his feet beneath him.\n\nWhen Thune finally voted, his “not guilty” was done in barely-audible volume. Murkowski, who sits behind him, shot a glare at the back of his head. \n \nAfter the vote, most senators were shuffling around and leaving the room to head out of town aside from the two leaders...\n\nExcept Lisa Murkowski, who leaned over to McConnell and whispered a few words.

We usually know the outcome of things. Sometimes day in advance. But today, a huge O. Henry surprise. And where this takes the second impeachment trial, no one really knows.\n\nThe tectonic plates on Capitol Hill just shifted significantly. With the Senate vote for witnesses, this could potentially extend the trial for weeks. Both sides will need to depose witnesses, summoned on both sides as well as open the gates to “discovery.” \n\nRepublicans really played into the hands of Democrats. A 50/50 vote, along party lines, by rule, would have lost. But Republicans used the math against Democrats today, joining them to make sure they stretch out the trial.\n\nThis is not want Democrats wanted at all. They wanted to put the the trial to bed and get on with passing a coronavirus bill in the coming weeks. This could disrupt all of that. \n\nA Senate trial is supposed be a political forum. That’s what the Founders intended. A Senate impeachment trial is not like a traditional courtroom. But by shifting it to issuing subpoenas for witnesses, this tilts the field more to the traditional legal realm. That’s the turf of President Trump’s defense counsel team of Mike van der Veen, Bruce Castor and David Schoen. \n\nSo, where this goes, no one knows.

His head was in his hands, and he clasped and unclasped his hands several times. He shook his feet beneath him.\n\nWhen Thune finally voted, his “not guilty” was done in barely-audible volume. Murkowski, who sits behind him, shot a glare at the back of his head. \n \nAfter the vote, most senators were shuffling around and leaving the room to head out of town aside from the two leaders...\n\nExcept Lisa Murkowski, who leaned over to McConnell and whispered a few words.

With the Senate vote for witnesses, this could potentially extend the trial for weeks. Both sides will need to depose witnesses, summoned on both sides as well as open the gates to “discovery.” \n\nRepublicans really played into the hands of Democrats. A 50\u002F50 vote, along party lines, by rule, would have lost. But Republicans used the math against Democrats today, joining them to make sure they stretch out the trial.\n\nThis is not want Democrats wanted at all. They wanted to put the the trial to bed and get on with passing a coronavirus bill in the coming weeks. This could disrupt all of that. \n\nA Senate trial is supposed be a political forum. That’s what the Founders intended. A Senate impeachment trial is not like a traditional courtroom. But by shifting it to issuing subpoenas for witnesses, this tilts the field more to the traditional legal realm. That’s the turf of President Trump’s defense counsel team of Mike van der Veen, Bruce Castor and David Schoen. \n\nSo, where this goes, no one knows.

On Tuesday, Biden traveled to Wisconsin, his first time leaving Washington in a month, for a CNN town hall where he 
laid out an ambitious vaccination timeline
 ("enough vaccines for every single American" by the end of July) and tried to clear up confusion about students returning to school.
While the US made progress in 
vaccinating more people
 and 
dipping infection rates
, a historic winter storm crippled the middle of the nation, throwing
 vaccine supply chains into chaos
 and pushing the entire state of Texas into crisis.
Faced with bout after bout of winter storms and a 
power grid woefully unprepared
, Texans were forced to fare with rolling power outages, 
boil water notices
, food shortages and little end in sight.
After losing power at home in Houston, one Texan 
tried
 to head to warmer weather. Sen. Ted Cruz, 
who has a habit of criticizing other elected officials for vacationing during crises
, was caught headed to Cancun, Mexico, on Wednesday night. Cruz only stayed one night in the tropical locale before heading back to Texas, appearing to blame his daughters before 
fully apologizing
.Â 
Other Republicans are headed to another warm climate: West Palm Beach. Former President Donald Trump is fielding a 
growing number of Republicans looking for counsel from the 45th president at Mar-a-Lago
. But, as 
Nikki Haley recently learned
, not every interested caller gets a warm welcome.
The Point
: Biden is headed full steam ahead with his Covid-19 relief package as the GOP reassesses its relationship with the 45th president.

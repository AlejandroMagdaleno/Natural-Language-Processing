Here's Trump:
"In 'Mitch's Senate,' over the last two election cycles, I single-handedly saved at least 12 Senate seats, more than eight in the 2020 cycle aloneâand then came the Georgia disaster, where we should have won both U.S. Senate seats, but McConnell matched the Democrat offer of $2,000 stimulus checks with $600...
"....My only regret is that McConnell 'begged' for my strong support and endorsement before the great people of Kentucky in the 2020 election, and I gave it to him. He went from one point down to 20 points up, and won."
Let's start with the second claim first -- that, without Trump's help, McConnell would have lost his reelection bid to Democrat Amy McGrath.
In early July, on the same day that McGrath officially entered the race, Trump tweeted out a full-throated endorsement of McConnell. "Why would Kentucky ever think of giving up the most powerful position in Congress, the Senate Majority Leader, for a freshman Senator with little power in what will hopefully be the minority party,"
 tweeted Trump
. "We need Mitch in the Senate to Keep America Great!!"
Trump appears to be citing a 
May 2020 poll conducted for US Term Limits
 that showed McGrath at 41% to 40% for McConnell. But that's the only
 poll conducted in the entirety of the race 
that showed it even close. McConnell's chances of winning the race never dropped below 93% in 
538's projections
. He wound up winning by almost 20 points, the second-largest margin of victory in his six terms in office.
The idea that Trump somehow "saved" McConnell in the 2020 contest is, in a word, laughable. "I personally showed Trump polling in the Oval Office that had @Team_Mitch up 20 points," 
tweeted Kevin McLaughlin
, who ran the National Republican Senatorial Committee in the 2020 cycle, on Tuesday night. "He knows this isn't true."
Now, let's turn to Trump's other major contention -- that he "single-handedly" saved eight Senate seats in the 2020 election. Assuming he, wrongly, counts the McConnell race as one that he saved, what are the other seven?
Start here: Democrats wound up netting three seats by beating four incumbents -- one each in Colorado and Arizona and two in Georgia. Republicans flipped only a single seat to their side -- beating Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in the strongly Republican state of Alabama. In all four of the seats Democrats won, they ran heavily on Trump's unpopularity -- especially among suburban voters and women.
So, where, exactly did Trump save Republican seats?
While "save" is too strong a word and "single-handedly saved" is WAY too strong, it seems to me that Trump's strength among the Republican base -- and his ability to turn them out -- helped Sens. Joni Ernst (Iowa), Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Steve Daines (Montana) win by comfortable margins against serious Democratic challengers. And Trump carrying North Carolina --albeit narrowly -- probably helped Sen. Thom Tillis (R) get over the finish line ahead of his Democratic challenger. (Worth noting
: Reports of extramarital affair involving the Democratic nominee
 also clearly played a role.)
But beyond those four-ish races, I struggle to find more where Trump played any major role in the GOP candidate's victory. Certainly not Maine, where Sen. Susan Collins (R) won reelection by a stunning 9 points even while being bashed for her ties to Trump in a state the 45th president lost by 9 points. In Texas, Sen. John Cornyn would have won with or without Trump. (Cornyn won his race by 9.5 points; Trump carried Texas by just 5.5.) Ditto Dan Sullivan in Alaska and Roger Marshall in Kansas.
There's just no way that any even semi-objective look at the 2020 map produces eight seats that Trump "saved." It takes a generous read of the map to give him partial credit for wins in even half of that number.
What's Trump up to, then? H;'s rewriting the history of his presidency to suggest that without him the Republican Party would be absolutely nowhere. Of course, the reality is this: Trump left Washington with Republicans having lost the White House, Senate and House during his four years. Facts are stubborn things, huh?

Babin said in a 
statement 
that he started experiencing mild, cold-like symptoms Friday and, after a few negative tests, he tested positive for coronavirus Saturday morning. 
The GOP congressman and dentist, who is also a member of the Republican Doctors Caucus that has been advocating for people to get the Covid-19 vaccine, said he's been fully vaccinated since December. 
"I've felt better, but I've also felt worse," Babin said, adding that he has begun a "therapeutic regimen" at the advice of his doctors. 
Babin, who represents Texas' 36th Congressional District encompassing parts of the northeast of Houston to the Louisiana border, is among 
dozens of federal lawmakers
 who said they have tested positive over the course of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Texas Republican is the 10th member of the House to recently have tested positive for Covid-19 since early August. Ohio Reps. Tim Ryan, a Democrat, and Bob Latta, a Republican, who are also both vaccinated, 
announced Monday
 that they tested positive for Covid-19.
Four senators have also contracted the virus after being vaccinated.

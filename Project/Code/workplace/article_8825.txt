CNN anchor and chief political correspondent Dana Bash will moderate.

The special will also be available on demand to subscribers via cable/satellite systems, CNNgo platforms and CNN mobile apps.
From the outset, the Biden administration has made climate a key focus.
Before taking office, Biden in December announced his climate team, in a historic display of the then-President-elect's effort to prioritize his administration's response to the climate crisis.
"I'm pleased to announce a team that will lead my administration's ambitious plan to address the existential threat of our time, climate change," Biden said at the time.
And on his first day in office, Biden took 
executive actions 
to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and direct agencies to review and reverse more than 100 Trump actions on the environment.
Just a week later, Biden 
signed several more executive actions 
related to the climate crisis, including one directing the secretary of the Interior to pause on entering into new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or offshore waters.
Since the early days of his administration, Biden and other administration officials have emphasized that the White House is taking a "whole of government" approach to climate change. They've also underscored that they believe the President's actions will help spur job growth, and categorized people working in industries vulnerable to job loss, such as coal miners, under their umbrella of environmental justice.
"It's about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we exist with as now facing us, climate change, with a greater sense of urgency," he said at a January signing ceremony. "In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. We can't wait any longer."

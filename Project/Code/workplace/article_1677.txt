A historic job approval drop
: The GOP governor's job approval rating among registered voters is underwater for the first time since 2018, 
according to polling from Quinnipiac University
, finding 44% of Texans approve of Abbott's work as 
governor while 47% disapprove.Â 
51% say he does not deserve reelection
: When Texas voters are asked about Abbott's reelection prospects, a slight majority (51%) say he does not deserve to be reelected; 42% say he does.
That disapproval grew in the last three months
: Compare that with June, when voters were split at 48% saying he did not deserve reelection while 46% said he did.
Let's go over what happened this summer: Abbott codified laws 
restricting abortion
 andÂ 
banning government vaccine mandates
, and grappling with a 
surge of migrants at the US-Mexico border
, among 
other issues
.Â 
Voters give Abbott a thumbs down on his handling of all three hot-button issues:Â 
Situation at the Mexican border: 
43%
 approve, 
46%
 disapprove.
Response to the coronavirus: 
46%
 approve, 
50%
 disapprove.
Abortion: 
37%
 approve, 
53%
 disapprove.
Abbot 
does
 get a thumbs up on the economy. A solid 
53%
 of voters approve of his handling of the economy, while 
39%
 disapprove.Â 
There is a silver lining for Abbott in the Quinnipiac poll. Voters may not like him right now, but they dislike other high-profile gubernatorial prospects even more.
50%
 said they did not think Democrat (and former Senate and presidential candidate) 
Beto O'Rourke
 would make a good governor.
Nearly the same amount (
49%
) said they did not think actor 
Matthew McConaughey
, an Austin resident and Texas native, would make a good governor. McConaughey recently said on a podcast that he is "measuring" a run, despite having no party affiliation or stated platform.
The Point
: Texas voters aren't totally keen on Abbott's reelection, but so far, polling shows they dislike the alternatives even more.

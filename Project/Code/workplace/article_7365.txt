Altogether, the President has now put forward 20 names for federal judge vacancies. 
The White House described many of the nominees as "groundbreaking choices," and said in a statement: "These individuals embody President Biden's commitment to ensure that his judicial nominees represent not only the excellence but the diversity of our nation with respect to both personal and professional backgrounds."
Biden announced he would nominate Gustavo GelpÃ­ Jr. to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. GelpÃ­ Jr.Â is a federal judge on the US District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and has served as chief judge of the court since 2018, according to the White House. 
GelpÃ­ received the backing of two Democratic members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, New York Rep. Nydia Velazquez and Arizona Rep. RaÃºl Grijalva. 
Velazquez, who used to chair the caucus, praised GelpÃ­ as "a strong defender of civil rights and of the people of Puerto Rico" and urged the Senate to quickly confirm his nomination. She noted GelpÃ­ would be just the second Hispanic judge to serve on the First Circuit. 
Grijalva commended the Biden administration for "nominating a judge who has both denounced the racist underpinnings of the Insular Cases and criticized the Supreme Court and Congress for denying U.S. citizens residing in the Territories the legal rights the rest of us take for granted."
He called for federal courts to extend national federal benefits to citizens living in US territories, including Puerto Rico. 
Eunice Lee will be Biden's nominee for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Lee is an assistant federal defender with the Federal Defenders of New York.

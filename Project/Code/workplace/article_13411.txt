"I get up in the morning and look at Jill and say: 'Where the hell are we?' " Biden said with a smile at a CNN town hall in Milwaukee. 
The President, who has been 
in office for four weeks now
, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that he finds himself "extremely self-conscious" when the White House staff waits on him, including handing him his suit coat.
"I don'tÂ know about you all, but I wasÂ raised in a way that you didn'tÂ look for anybody to wait on you," Biden said. 
Though he had been in the Oval Office countless times as vice president, Biden said he had never been in the residence except for the Yellow Oval Room, which is often used for formal private receptions for important guests. 
"I don't know what I ever expected it to be," he said.
He said the White House is "very different" from 
the vice president's residence
, the sprawling US Naval Observatory, where he lived for eight years. 
"You can walk off a porch inÂ the summer and jump in a poolÂ and, you know, go into the work," Biden said of the vice president's residence. "You can ride a bicycle aroundÂ and never leave the property andÂ work out."
He compared the heavily fortified White House, on the other hand, to a "gilded cage, in terms of beingÂ able to walk outside and doÂ things."
Biden said his brother and several presidential historians, including Jon Meacham, had helped him set up the Oval Office. 
"It all happens within two hours,Â you know, literally," he said of the quick transition after former President Donald Trump left office. "They move everything out andÂ move something in."
"I feel a sense of -- I mustÂ tell you, a sense of historyÂ about it," the President said. 
"It was interesting to hear theseÂ historians talk about what otherÂ presidents have gone through andÂ the moments and who the peopleÂ who stepped up to the ball andÂ who are the people that didn't," Biden said. 
He continued: "And what you realize is, the mostÂ consequential thing for me isÂ although I've known thisÂ watching seven presidents, who IÂ got to know fairly well, is IÂ always in the past looked at theÂ presidency in the terms ofÂ Abraham Lincoln and FranklinÂ Roosevelt and 
George Washington
 and how can ... they're superhuman."
Biden said he had to remind himself that though they are "really fine men," he knew them well enough to know "that I play on the same team" with them. 
"So it took away the sense ofÂ this is, my God, you know,Â I'm not 
Abraham Lincoln.
Â I'm not Franklin Roosevelt.Â How do I deal with theseÂ problems?" the President continued. 
Though he has been president for only four weeks, he said that "it feels like fourÂ years." 
"It's not because of the burden," he said. "It's because there's so muchÂ happening that you're focusedÂ on, you're constantly focusingÂ on one problem or opportunity."

The executive, Matthew Calamari Jr., was served a subpoena to testify, and he is expected to appear to answer questions before the grand jury, the source said. Calamari Jr. is the son of the company's chief operating officer, a longtime Trump deputy who is also under scrutiny by prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney's office.
The Wall Street Journal was 
first to report 
on Calamari Jr.'s expected grand jury testimony.
Under New York state law, Calamari Jr. will be granted transactional immunity on the subjects he testifies about. The decision to bring him before the grand jury signals prosecutors do not plan to indict him. 
A spokesman for the Manhattan district attorney's office declined to comment.
In July, the district attorney's office 
charged
 the Trump Organization and Chief Financial Officer 
Allen Weisselberg
 with a 15-year alleged tax scheme, saying they systematically avoided paying payroll taxes and income taxes on fringe benefits including rent-free apartments, cars and private school tuition. They pleaded not guilty.
Since prior to the indictment, Calamari Jr. and his father have faced questions by prosecutors about whether they properly paid taxes on subsidized rent and cars they received as benefits from the company, CNN has previously reported.
In recent weeks, the district attorney's office has been pressuring Matthew Calamari Sr., known to be a fiercely loyal employee of the former President, to cooperate, and discussions between prosecutors and his lawyer have continued, the source said.

Wright and Ellzey forced the special runoff election earlier this month after beating out a sprawling field of Republicans and Democrats competing for the US House seat. 
Wright had received a boost when former President Donald Trump endorsed her over the 10 other Republicans in the race. She has focused much of her campaign on her husband's legacy, but was also quick to promote the President's endorsement.
Ellzey

While Ron Wright was reelected by 9 percentage points in 2020, the 6th District has been trending more Democratic in recent elections. In 2012, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney carried the district with a 17-percentage-point margin. Trump won it by 12 percentage points in 2016 but by only 3 last year.

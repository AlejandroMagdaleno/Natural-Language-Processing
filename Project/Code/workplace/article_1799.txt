"It's 4 a.m. in Iowa so I'm running," 
Grassley tweeted
, accompanied by a video of him, well, running. "I do that 6 days a week. Before I start the day I want you to know what Barbara and I have decided. I'm running for re-electionâa lot more to do, for Iowa."
That sound you hear is Senate Republicans breathing aÂ majorÂ sigh of relief. At 88 years old (his birthday was last Friday), Grassley was regarded by strategists in both parties as a potential retirement in advance of his 2022 reelection.Â 
Grassley has proved to be the most reliable vote-getter in Iowa for the entirety of his four decades in the Senate. Since taking 54% in his first victory, in 1980, Grassley has never dipped below 60% of the vote in his six reelection bids.Â 
In 2016, Democrats touted the candidacy of Patty Judge, but Grassley cruised to a 24-point win.
Grassley's candidacy effectively then takes Iowa off the board as a competitive race. While Democrats will still talk up their chances with former Rep. 
Abby Finkenauer in the race
, there's just no evidence -- recent or not recent -- that Grassley is vulnerable in the least.
That's a big change from what the contest would have lookedÂ  like if Grassley had retired. While Republicans would still have had an edge -- Iowa leans GOP these days -- the race would have been seriously fought and expensive for both sides.Â 
The Point
: It's now likely that national Republicans won't have to spend a dime to reelect Grassley. Which means more money for offensive opportunities for Republicans in states like Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire.

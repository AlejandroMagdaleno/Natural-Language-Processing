Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who just won reelection last fall, said in a statement that he expects "to make a full recovery."
"Next week, I will have surgery in North Carolina to treat prostate cancer," he said. "I am in the hands of outstanding medical professionals and expect to make a full recovery."
Tillis also noted he had no symptoms and reiterated the importance of getting routine screenings.
"I am blessed that my cancer was detected relatively early, and I can't emphasize enough how important routine screenings are, regardless of how healthy you think you are," he said in a statement.
Adding that: "I had no symptoms and would have never imagined I had cancer. My prognosis is good because I went to my annual physical and received a PSA test, which led to a biopsy and eventually my diagnosis. Early detection can truly save lives."
Tillis, 60, just began 
serving his second term 
in the US Senate.
As the US Senate is split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans with Vice President Kamala Harris casting any tie breaking votes, any senator's absence could shift the power dynamic.

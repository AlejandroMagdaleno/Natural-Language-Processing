These 22 laws in 14 states mark a new record for restrictive voting laws since 2011, when the Brennan Center 
recorded 19 laws enacted in 14 state legislatures
.
Most of the new laws make it harder to vote absentee and by mail, after a record number of Americans voted by mail in November.
In addition to the new laws, the Brennan Center's 
latest report
 identified 61 bills that were advancing through 18 state legislatures as of May 14. Advancing bills include those that have either passed at least one chamber or have otherwise made progress at the committee level.
More than half of the 61 advancing bills would restrict absentee and mail-in voting. About a quarter include provisions that target voter ID requirements and voter roll purges.
Not every bill that is advancing will pass, or even reach a vote, though state lawmakers are likely to act quickly to attempt to get their bills over the finish line. All but 12 state legislatures 
plan to adjourn by June 30
, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Overall, since the election, the Brennan Center has identified at least 389 bills introduced in 48 states that include provisions that would restrict voting access. The only two states where lawmakers have not yet introduced a restrictive voting bill are Delaware and Vermont.
The legislative push is part of a national 
Republican effort to restrict access
 to the ballot box following record turnout in the 2020 election. Republicans currently 
control both chambers of 30 state legislatures
, including in Texas, Georgia and Arizona. 
Texas is a key state to watch with the most restrictive voting bills introduced overall, though it has not yet enacted any of those 49 bills. Texas is tied with Michigan for the most bills (nine) still advancing through the legislature.

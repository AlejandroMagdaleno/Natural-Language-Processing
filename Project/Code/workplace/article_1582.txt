Speaking hours after 
remnants of Hurricane Ida
 caused dangerous flash floods and tornadoes across the Northeast and as wildfires burn their way across the western US, Biden said his infrastructure proposals would shore up infrastructure that will be challenged in the coming decades.
"The past fewÂ days of Hurricane Ida and theÂ wildfires in the West and theÂ unprecedented flash floods inÂ New York and New Jersey is yetÂ another reminder that theseÂ extreme storms and the climateÂ crisis are here," Biden said, speaking from the White House.  
The President said the nation needs to be better prepared, and argued his plan would make key investments that would make electric grids and transmission lines more resilient to storms, wildfires and floods. 
Biden said he had spoken to the governors of New York and New Jersey in the wake of the floods and damage, and said he was planning on speaking to the governor of Pennsylvania.  
"There's a lot of damage, and I made clear to the governors that my team at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is on the ground and ready to provide all the assistance that's needed," Biden said, speaking from the White House. 
"My message to everyone affected is we're all in this together.Â The nation is here to help.Â That's the message I've beenÂ making clear to the mayors,Â governors, energy and utilityÂ leaders in the region who myÂ administration has been workingÂ closely with over the past fewÂ days," Biden said. 
Biden said since the hurricane made landfall, more than 6,000 members of theÂ National Guard have beenÂ activated in Louisiana, Mississippi,Â Alabama and Texas and otherÂ states to support search and rescueÂ efforts.
"We know that there is much to beÂ done in this response on ourÂ part.Â We need to get power restored.Â We need to get more food, fuelÂ and water deployed," Biden said. 
The President said he gets hourly updates on relief efforts from FEMA "well into theÂ night," and said his team would be working "around the clock until theÂ critical needs of the region areÂ fully met. And we will meetÂ them."
Biden said his team has been working with private companies to accelerate the restoration of power and cell phone services. 
"It's beginning to get back up, but there's a long way to go," Biden said. 
Biden 
will be traveling on Friday to Louisiana
 to meet with Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and parish presidents, mayors and local officials representing the affected areas. He said the governor encouraged the President to come and assured him his visit would not disrupt recovery efforts on the ground.
"We are here for you," Biden said, addressing those affected by the storm. "And we're making sure theÂ response and recovery isÂ equitable, so that those hit hardest getÂ the resources they need and areÂ not left behind."
Biden noted the region hit by the hurricane is a key center of the nation's oil production and refining infrastructure. As a result, he said his administration is moving quickly to increase the availability ofÂ gas and ease the pressure onÂ gas prices around the country.
The President said he had directed Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm "to use all of the toolsÂ at her disposal, including usingÂ the Strategic Petroleum ReserveÂ to keep gas flowing to the pumpsÂ in order to get criticalÂ supplies to the region."
Biden also called on private insurance companies to pay their policy holders what they are owed to cover the cost of temporary housing amid the natural disaster. 
"Don't hide behind the fine printÂ and technicality.Â Do your job.Â Keep your commitment to yourÂ communities you insure.Â Do the right thing," Biden said. 
New York declared a state of emergency early Thursday morning. 
At least 11 people have died
Â in New York City, New Jersey and Maryland.
Biden met on Monday with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell and governors and mayors from states and cities affected by Ida after the storm made landfall on Sunday in Louisiana and caused catastrophic damage. 
Residents are now facing gas shortages and dwindling supplies, and power outages in some Louisiana parishesÂ could last at least a month. 
The President on Monday spoke about the number of actions the federal government had taken, including working with private sector energy providers to restore power to the more than one million Louisianans that at the time were without electricity.
Ahead of the storm, Biden approved the state of Louisiana's request for a major federal disaster declaration and the state of Mississippi's request for an emergency declaration. He said these declarations allowed federal aid to be ready ahead of time to supplement state, tribal and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by Ida.
The President visited FEMA's headquarters in Washington on Sunday to receive a briefing on the storm. While there, Biden warned the hurricane was life-threatening and that the devastation was likely to be immense.

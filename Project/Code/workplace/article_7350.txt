The President said he was going to work with governors in affected states and direct federal agencies to provide assistance to monitor and put an end to price gouging. 
"I also want to say something toÂ the gas stations: Do not, I repeat, do not try toÂ take advantage of consumersÂ during this time," Biden said, speaking from the White House. 
The President said: "Nobody should be using thisÂ situation for financial gain.Â That's what the hackers areÂ trying to do.Â That's what they're about.Â Not us.Â That's not who we are."
Many Americans began panic-buying and hoarding gasoline in the wake of the ranomsware hack that caused Colonial to shut down its pipeline as a precaution. While the shutdown was not expected to cause any supply issues, the rush on fuel has overwhelmed gas stations in the Southeast and caused a supply crunch. 
TheÂ Colonial Pipeline, which provides nearly half the gasoline and diesel consumed by the East Coast, launched a restart of its operations on Wednesday evening after being shut down for days following the attack. 
Biden said Thursday the pipeline is reaching its full operational capacity but "we'll not feel the effects atÂ the pump immediately."
"This is not like flicking on aÂ light switch.Â This pipeline is 5,500 milesÂ long.Â It had never been fully shutÂ down in its entire history," Biden said. 
AÂ significant percentage of gas stationsÂ in Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina are without fuel, according to GasBuddy, which tracks fuel demand, prices and outages.
The President also had a message for Americans concerned about fuel shortages.
"Don't panic, number one," Biden said. "I know seeing lines at theÂ pumps, or gas stations with noÂ gas, can be extremely stressful.Â But this is a temporaryÂ situation."
The President added, "Do not get more gas than youÂ need in the next few days.Â As I said, we expect theÂ situation to begin to improve byÂ the weekend, and into early nextÂ week, and gasoline supply isÂ coming back online, and panicÂ buying will only slow theÂ process." 
In recent days, Biden administration officials have warned Americans against hoarding and improperly storing gasoline as the panic-buying threatens to exacerbate the supply shock.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm have all pleaded with the American people not to hoard gasoline as the pipeline worked to get back online.

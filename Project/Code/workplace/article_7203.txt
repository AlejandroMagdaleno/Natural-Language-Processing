In a memo sent to members Monday, the Office of the Attending Physician wrote to remind members that masks are still required. 
"Extra precautions are necessary given the substantial number of partially vaccinated, unvaccinated, and vaccine-indeterminate individuals," the letter read. "These measure allow for all participants to be treated in the same fashion without displaying any unique identification feature that would separate individuals based on their vaccination or health status."
CNN has confirmed that all of the 219 House Democrats say they have received the Covid-19 vaccination, and 97 of the 211 Republicans say they have received the vaccine. 
The total membership of the House Republican conference has changed from 212 to 211 to reflect the resignation of Rep. Steve Stivers from the House of Representatives.
One hundred and nine Republican offices have not responded to multiple CNN inquiries about the members' vaccination status.
The list of the members CNN has confirmed are vaccinated is below:

CNN reported
 that the freshman congresswoman from Georgia repeatedly indicated support for executing prominent Democratic politicians in 2018 and 2019, according to a CNN KFile review of hundreds of posts and comments from her Facebook page. In the days after CNN's reporting, other past comments and actions from recent years resurfaced, 
including a confrontation
 with Parkland school shooting survivor David Hogg, and another post 
agreeing with people
 who said the Parkland shooting was a "false flag" operation.
Greene has also 
deleted videos
 she posted on Facebook Live where she said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is "guilty of treason" and that she will "suffer death or she'll be in prison" for her "treason."
Lawmakers calling for Greene's expulsion from Congress
As of Tuesday evening, at least 67 House lawmakers have signed onto a resolution to be introduced by Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez calling for Greene's expulsion from Congress. 
Under the Constitution, the House of Representatives has the power to expel any member with a two-thirds vote, but 
it's unlikely Greene will be forced to give up her seat
. Republicans control just under half the seats in the chamber, and GOP leadership has not shown any steps so far toward reprimanding Greene for her comments or previous posts.

Lawmakers calling for her censure
Some lawmakers are urging for Greene's censure. Censuring a member of the House represents the chamber's deep disapproval of a member's misconduct and is imposed with a simple majority vote. Democrats maintain a slight majority in the House.

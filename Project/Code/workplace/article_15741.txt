The 
agency is specifically asking
 about the man seen in what it describes as Photograph #30. In addition, it has 
posted a number of bulletins asking for help
 in identifying dozens of others whose images were captured amid the attempted insurgency. 
The FBI "is seeking the public's assistance in identifying this individual who made unlawful entry into US Capitol on Jan. 6," its Washington Field Office tweeted. Tipsters may reference Photograph #30 specifically.
Some people who stormed the Capitol have already come forward or 
have been identified
 by CNN and other news organizations. Many face criminal charges, and some have 
lost or left their jobs 
because of their participation.
Anyone with information about the man carrying the flag or others who participated can contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI. Tips can also be submitted by

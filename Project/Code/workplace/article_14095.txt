This is the first time the force has confirmed that two officers took their own lives after the attack.
"Tragically, two officers who were at the Capitol on January 6th, one each from the Capitol Police and MPD, took their own lives in the aftermath of that battle," Contee said in his statement.
The Washington Post
 was first to report about Contee's statements on Tuesday.
Another Capitol Police officer, Brian D. Sicknick, 
died the day after the riot
 "due to injuries sustained while on-duty," the Capitol Police said in a statement earlier this month.

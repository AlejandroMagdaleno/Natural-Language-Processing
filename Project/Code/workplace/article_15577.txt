In what should have been a week littered with legacy-building efforts like interviews and speeches, instead we saw an increasingly isolated President surrounded by a Capitol complex that has been turned into a fortress.
One week after a violent mob stormed the capitol, US troops quartered in the US Capitol complex. More US troops are now in Washington, DC, 
than in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria combined
, in response to the deadly insurrection that is turning 
more disturbing as more details emerge
 -- and in the face of 
serious threats in Washington and around the country ahead of Biden's inauguration
.
Where things stand now, President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration won't serve as a completely clean break from Trump's Washington. For starters, the Senate faces 
juggling
 an impeachment trial with confirmation of Biden's appointees come January 20.
This time next week, Biden will helm a nation in the midst of a still-deadly pandemic, increasingly complicated vaccination efforts, a dire economic situation and the worst domestic unrest in at least a generation. It will be a first 100 days unlike any other.
The Point
: Moving boxes are here, scaffolding is going up, and the military has established a secure zone around the nation's seat of government. Biden's inauguration is fast approaching.

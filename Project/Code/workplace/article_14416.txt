There's no indication in the court record that a laptop was actually taken from Pelosi's office, though Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, tweeted two days after the attack that there was a laptop stolen that was used for presentations and that was in a conference room. The FBI says in the court record the "matter remains under investigation." It's not known if the two incidents are connected at all, or even if the tipster's information about a stolen laptop is accurate. 
It's one of the more bizarre details to emerge in the avalanche of
 court filings 
against people accused of 
storming the Capitol
.   
In this case, a person who said they are the former romantic partner of Riley June Williams of Pennsylvania identified Williams to the FBI in video inside the Capitol building and directing people "upstairs" to Pelosi's office, according to an affidavit filed Sunday supporting Williams' arrest.
The tipster "also claimed to have spoken to friends of Williams, who showed (the tipster) a video of Williams taking a laptop computer or hard drive from 
Speaker Pelosi's office
," the affidavit says. The tipster "stated that Williams intended to send the computer device to a friend in Russia, who then planned to sell the device to SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service."
The person told the FBI the "transfer of the computer device to Russia fell through for unknown reasons and Williams still has the computer device or destroyed it," the affidavit says.  
A Justice Department spokeswoman told CNN on Monday that Williams had surrendered to authorities.
Williams is not accused of theft. She is only charged with violent entry or disorderly conduct, and entering the restricted space of the Capitol, the same charges faced by many who took part in the siege that day. 
The FBI also noted it appeared that Williams had fled and deleted her social media accounts.
This story has been updated with Williams' arrest.

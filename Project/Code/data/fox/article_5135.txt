President Biden&#39;s
 son,

reported 
on the 100-day hiccup on Thursday, pointing out that BHR Partners is co-owned by the Bank of China, the state-controlled central bank.
Hunter previously sat on the Chinese firm&#39;s board before announcing in October 2019 that he would be stepping down over mounting scrutiny from his father&#39;s presidential bid.

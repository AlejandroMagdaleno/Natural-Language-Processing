Stefanik replaces Rep. Liz Cheney amid party tension over future.
Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., has pledged to use her role as 
House Republican
 Conference chair to guide the 
GOP
 back to a congressional majority.
The conference 
elected her
 as chairwoman May 14, elevating the lawmaker to replace Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming.
&#34;This will not be an easy job, but I know we are stronger when united as a team,&#34; Stefanik told colleagues in her acceptance speech.
LIZ CHENEY OUSTED FROM ROLE AS HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE CHAIR; REPLACEMENT STILL UNCLEAR
She&#39;s criticized 
President Biden&#39;s
 policies made within his first 100 days in office as &#34;the most significant Far-Left Socialist dismantling of America by any President or Congress in our Nation’s history.&#34;

Former President Trump had endorsed Stefanik for the position earlier in the week. Tension had been building between Cheney and the rest of the party over its support for Trump and reliance on him in the future.
Stefanik, 36, was the youngest woman ever elected to 
Congress
 in 2014 at age 30 – before Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was elected in 2018 at the age of 29.

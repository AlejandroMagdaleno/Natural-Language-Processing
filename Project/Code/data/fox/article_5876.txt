ARIZONA TEACHING MATERIAL SUGGESTS BABIES NEED ANTI-RACISM GUIDANCE
&#34;These books teach about some of the history of racial injustice in our country and attempt to
give messages about the advocacy and anti-racist activism that we want to inspire in all our
students,&#34; reads a note atop the reading list. 
Another book on the list is &#34;Stamped,&#34; by 
Ibram Kendi
, a 
far-left academic
 who has 
called for
 &#34;an anti-racist amendment to the U.S. Constitution that enshrines two guiding anti-racist principals: Racial inequity is evidence of racist policy and the different racial groups are equals. The amendment would make unconstitutional racial inequity over a certain threshold, as well as racist ideas by public officials.&#34;

The reading list&#39;s revelation comes amid a 
national uproar
 over race-
centric curricula
 in schools. 
&#34;These titles are in partnership with our Public Library and are not assigned by the school department but suggested titles for families to use at their discretion,&#34; Belmont Superintendent John Phelan told Fox News in an email. 
He added that &#34;we had some  emails from the community with the suggestion to review the list and process – which we will do with our public library partners in August.&#34;

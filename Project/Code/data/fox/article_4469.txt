&#34;The Vice President [Harris] will not join Governor [Newsom] in California tomorrow,&#34; Click said. &#34;Tomorrow’s rally is cancelled. No further updates to share at this time.&#34;
Harris and Newsom were requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test for attendees to enter the rally.

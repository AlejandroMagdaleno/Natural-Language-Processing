U.S.-led diplomacy focusing on North Korea&#39;s nuclear weapons remains stalemated because of disputes over sanctions.

IRAN AND NORTH KOREA SEEN AS TEAMING UP AGAIN
Earlier this week, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned the United States to &#34;refrain from causing a stink,&#34; while criticizing the U.S.-South Korean drills that her government views as an invasion rehearsal.
&#34;We take this opportunity to warn the new U.S. administration trying hard to give off powder smell in our land,&#34; Kim Yo Jong said in a statement to state news agency KCNA, 
according to
 Reuters. &#34;If it wants to sleep in peace for coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step.&#34;

Some experts say North Korea may further raise animosities with missile tests to boost its negotiation leverage. North Korea&#39;s moribund economy is hurting because of the pandemic-related border closure that has significantly shrunk its external trade and a spate of natural disasters last summer.
After Thursday&#39;s talks, Blinken, Austin and their South Korean counterparts said in a joint statement that North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile issues are &#34;a priority for the alliance&#34; and reaffirmed a shared commitment to address those issues.

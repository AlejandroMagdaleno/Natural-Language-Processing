David Schoen tells &#39;Hannity&#39; &#39;Judge&#39; Leahy and Democratic Senate &#39;jury&#39; predetermined vote
David Schoen, one of two attorneys who will represent former 
President Donald Trump
 in his 
Senate impeachment
 trial this month, told &#34;
Hannity
&#34; Monday that Senate Democrats have already determined that Trump is guilty of the charge laid against him.
Schoen told host Sean Hannity that in his view, &#34;this process is completely unconstitutional and it is a very, very dangerous road to take with respect to the First Amendment, putting at risk any passionate political speaker which is really against everything we believe and in this country.&#34;
&#34;I think it&#39;s also the most ill-advised legislative action that I&#39;ve seen in my lifetime,&#34; he added. &#34;It is tearing the country apart at a time when we don&#39;t need anything like that.&#34;
DAVID SCHOEN: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT TRUMP IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE ATTORNEY
The trial, which is scheduled to begin Feb. 9, will be presided over by Senate President Pro Tempore Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., rather than Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. 
&#34;Can you imagine any American citizen considering it to be a trial in which the judge and jury has already announced publicly that the defendant must be convicted in this case?&#34; Schoen asked. &#34;And in fact, Senator Leahy called on, demanded that Senator McConnell vote for a conviction also ... how can we possibly have a fair trial? Chuck Schumer, Senator Schumer promised a fair and full trial. You can&#39;t, when you know that the jurors and the judge are biased going in.&#34;

Schoen added that the impeachment managers -- led by Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md. -- plan to play montages of violent behavior during the Jan. 6 Capitol, and try to tie that to Trump.
&#34;This has nothing to do with President Trump and the country doesn&#39;t need to just watch videos of riots and unrest,&#34; Schoen said. &#34;We need to heal now. We need to move forward.&#34;

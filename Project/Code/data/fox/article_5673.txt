FOX News Congressional correspondent Mike Emanuel joins &#39;Special Report&#39; with an update from Capitol Hill.
Transportation Secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg claimed Thursday that 
President Biden
&#39;s decision to block the Keystone XL Pipeline is part of a broader plan that will end up being a net positive for employment, despite union outrage based on the loss of more than a thousand 
jobs
.
Biden revoked a necessary cross-border permit for the pipeline in an executive order on Wednesday, one of more than a dozen actions he took during his first hours in office. Construction on the project had stopped earlier in the day in anticipation of the move.
Biden
 nominated his former presidential primary rival to the position in December.
Buttigieg is just one of a number of nominees waiting to be confirmed in the Senate.
On Wednesday, the Senate confirmed Avril Haines, Biden&#39;s pick for director of national intelligence, in an 84-10 vote.

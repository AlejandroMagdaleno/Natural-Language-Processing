33-year law enforcement officer Lt. Randy Sutton says that rising retirements and lack of recruits are forcing police departments to ‘lower their standards’
Rep. 
Andy Biggs
, R-Ariz., asked Rep. 
Shiela Jackson Lee
, D-Texas, to schedule a hearing to examine calls to &#34;defund the 
police
&#34; and a possible correlation with rising violent 
crime
 in U.S. cities.
Biggs called on Jackson Lee, who chairs the House Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, to schedule a hearing on the matter in a 
letter
 signed by all 10 Republicans on the subcommittee, as well as Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, as The Daily Caller 
first reported
.
&#34;Violent crime is exploding in cities across America that have defunded the police,&#34; Biggs said in a Wednesday statement. &#34;These Democrat-run cities have maliciously attacked and smeared our police forces, but can’t understand why our officers are leaving the field in droves and why crime rates continue to sky-rocket.&#34;

He added that lawmakers &#34;must defend the thin blue line and restore law and order by holding the Democrats accountable for this destructive agenda.&#34;
Jackson Lee&#39;s office did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News.
Calls from 
progressive
 federal, state and local lawmakers to &#34;defund&#34; police departments or reduce state and citywide police budgets became popularized after then-Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd, a Black man, more than a year ago. The slogan has become commonplace among protesters, political pundits and progressive politicians.
Other more 
moderate Democrats
 have 
pushed back
 against the phrase as an idea that could be damaging to the party. 
Spikes in violent crime
 in major U.S. cities recorded 
over the last year
 have some officials questioning the effectiveness of the idea. 
MULTI-STATE SHOOTING SPREE WAS RACIALLY MOTIVATED, SUSPECT WAS TARGETING WHITE MEN: REPORT
&#34;The reckless decisions to defund police forces — and the Biden administration’s apathy towards these actions — have had a real effect on American communities,&#34; Biggs wrote in the letter. &#34;Homicides have increased in many of the cities that have defunded their police forces.&#34;
He noted that anti-police rhetoric and calls to reduce funding have &#34;led to a decrease in officer 
retention rates
 for police departments,&#34; early retirement among veteran officers and 
difficulty recruiting
 new officers.
Minneapolis has been 
ground zero
 for the &#34;defund the police&#34; movement in the wake of Floyd’s death. Though Chauvin was 
found guilty
 in Floyd’s death in April, unrest has continued and violence has escalated.

In February, the city 
backtracked
 on its original push to defund the police department after residents begged the city to hire more officers, citing longer response times and increased violent crime. 
Other major cities that have recorded increasing violent crime have shifted police funding toward other community services to meet protesters&#39; demands for alternative policing options in hopes of reducing police violence against minorities.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio cut the New York Police Department&#39;s budget by 
$1 billion
; Los Angeles approved a 
$150 million
 police budget cut; Philadelphia approved a 
$33 million
 police budget cut in June; Portland, Ore., cut 
$16 million
 from its police budget; and a number of other cities have approved 
similar reductions

Actor 
Matthew McConaughey
 said this week he is still &#34;measuring&#34; a potential 
gubernatorial 
run in 
Texas 
next year, according to reports. 
&#34;Look, it’s going to be in some capacity. …I just — I’m more of a folksy and philosopher-poet statesman than I am a, per se, definitive politician,&#34; McConaughey said on the &#34;Set‌ ‌it‌ ‌Straight:‌ ‌Myths‌ ‌and‌ ‌Legends&#34; podcast Tuesday, according to The Hill. &#34;So I go, well, that’s a reason not to, but then I go, no, that’s exactly why you should, because politics needs redefinition, but I’m measuring, you know, what is my category? What’s my embassy?&#34;
The &#34;Dallas Buyers Club&#34; actor has been mulling a run for about a year and a recent poll shows him doing better than Democrat 
Beto O’Rourke
 against current Gov. 
Greg Abbott
, beating Abbott 44-35%, according to the 
Houston Chronicle.

The podcast’s hosts, members of the band Midland, had urged McConaughey to go for it. 
&#34;I have to remain an artist,&#34; he said on the podcast, 
The Hill
 reported. &#34;I’ve earned my right to enjoy that Saturday night part of life, that music part of life. It has to have music to it. You know what I mean. I’m very good at being diligent, Monday morning, practical, structure, I’m all of that. But I gotta continue to be an artist in what I do.&#34;

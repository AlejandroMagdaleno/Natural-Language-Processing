Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz joins &#39;Justice with Judge Jeanine&#39;
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene
, R.-Ga., regained access to her 
Twitter
 account frozen Monday after her account was temporarily locked over &#34;multiple violations&#34; on the social media platform.
Reuters 
reported 
that Greene got into a back and forth with a Georgia election official.
A Twitter spokesperson told Fox News that Greene’s account was &#34;temporarily locked out for multiple violations of our civic integrity policy.&#34; Greene’s office did not immediately respond to an email from Fox News seeking comment.
She resurfaced Monday by criticizing the social media company.
APPLE CEO: NO &#39;INTERSECTION&#39; BETWEEN FREE SPEECH, INCITEMENT OF VIOLENCE
&#34;Dear @Twitter, Contrary to how highly you think of yourself and your moral platitude, you are not the judge of humanity. God is,&#34; Greene wrote, adding that Twitter is &#34;
becoming boring
&#34; since President Trump was permanently banned after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
The move to lock out Greene from her account comes at a time Twitter faced new scrutiny over alleged censorship of conservatives.
The right-wing guerilla news outlet 
Project Veritas
 released a clip last Thursday given to them by a purported Twitter &#34;insider whistleblower&#34; who secretly recorded remarks by CEO Jack Dorsey to staff.

&#34;We know we are focused on one account right now, but this is going to be much bigger than just one account, and it’s going to go on for much longer than just this day, this week, and the next few weeks, and go on beyond the inauguration,&#34; 
Dorsey said
.
Many conservatives saw that comment as a sign of what’s to come.
Greene
 announced last week that she will be filing articles of impeachment against 
President-elect Joe Biden
 a day after the inauguration.
She said her motivation is to stand up for the 75 million Americans who are &#34;fed up with inaction&#34; in government.

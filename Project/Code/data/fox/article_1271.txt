Del Rio Mayor Bruno Lozano on how his city has been overwhelmed by the migrant surge.
President Biden
 insisted Wednesday that the surge in migrants at the southern border began under the 
Trump
 administration. 
&#34;This new surge we are dealing with now started with the last administration, but it’s our responsibility to deal with it humanely,&#34; Biden said as he met with his Secretary of Homeland Security Xavier Becerra and other top 
immigration
 advisers. 
&#34;There was a serious spike in people heading to the southern border even in the midst of that [the Trump administration]. That was because there were serious natural disasters&#34; in Latin America, Biden said. 
Biden has faced stiff criticism from Republicans who say his undoing of Trump’s strict border policies drew migrants northward. 
Biden also announced that he was tapping Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the White House effort to tackle migration challenges at the border, adding that Harris was the most qualified person to work with Mexico and Central American nations as they try to limit &#34;serious spikes&#34; in people trying to cross the border illegally.

The highest migration level at the border was in May 2019 under President Trump, when over 130,000 were apprehended at the border. Trump responded with policies to deter migrants, including the &#34;Remain in Mexico&#34; program, which required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until their claims could be heard.

Bill McGurn and Leo Terrell react on &#39;The Story&#39;
The head of the American Federation of 
Teachers
 
(AFT) Randi Weingarten makes over half a million dollars per year in her job – more than nine times the average teachers salary in the 
U.S.
In 2019, Weingarten received a salary of $489,844 along with $74,392 in other compensation, bringing her total haul for the year to $564,236, according to the AFT&#39;s Internal Revenue Service Form 990 for that year, the most recent year available. 
The median salary for public high school teachers was $62,870, as of May 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). For preschool, elementary, middle, secondary, and special education teachers, the median salary was $58,550, according to the BLS. 
CRITICAL RACE THEORY OPPONENTS TO BE TARGETED, ‘RESEARCHED’ BY NEA TEACHERS&#39; UNION
The AFT did not respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment on whether Weingarten&#39;s high salary is justified by her work.
Weingarten came under fire on Wednesday when she 
claimed
 that Republicans were &#34;bullying&#34; teachers out of teaching &#34;honest history&#34; about race while speaking during a livestream event headlined by controversial author Ibram X. Kendi.
&#34;There are legislators, mostly from the Republican party, who are currently bullying teachers and trying to stop us from teaching kids honest history,&#34; Weingarten said, referring to Republican opposition to 
critical race theory
 in schools. 
&#34;Look, maybe they are just trying to raise the temperature on race relations because of the next election,&#34; she continued.

Teachers&#39; unions across the country have come under fire over the past year for repeatedly throwing up obstacles to reopening schools for in-person learning during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Weingarten has recently 
rebranded herself
 as a staunch proponent of reopening schools.

Dozens of Antifa violent rioters and anti-mask protesters clashed in Los Angeles Saturday, resulting in one person stabbed, police said.
An anarchist group that has voiced support for 
Antifa
 appeared to encourage its followers to burn down police stations until &#34;flowers grow in the wreckage&#34; of the system. 
&#34;This is the Third Precinct in 
Minneapolis
, today,&#34; the group CrimethInc. posted on Twitter Friday along with a picture of a Minneapolis police station that was torched during Black Lives Matter rioting. &#34;When we say abolish the police, we don&#39;t mean beg politicians to defund them. We mean take grassroots action to prevent them from continuing to do harm—until flowers grow in the wreckage of their system.&#34;

The post continued, &#34;Abolishing the police means developing ways to resolve conflicts and address crises that do not depend on concentrating all coercive force into unaccountable institutions. It is a project that extends from our interpersonal relationships to mass action against state violence.
The Twitter account has posted several tweets supporting Antifa protesters over the past few years including posts 
pledging
 &#34;solidarity&#34; to &#34;Antifa sisters.&#34;

On its 
website

&#34;We strive to reinvent our lives and our world according to the principles of self-determination and mutual aid,&#34; the group’s description reads. &#34;We believe that you should be free to dispose of your limitless potential on your own terms: that no government, market, or ideology should be able to dictate what your life can be.&#34;

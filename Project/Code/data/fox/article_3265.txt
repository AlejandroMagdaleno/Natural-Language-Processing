&#39;Always a Soldier&#39; author Rob Smith joins &#39;The Next Revolution&#39; to discuss Democrats&#39; concerns with voter ID laws
As 
Democrats
 try to push the 
For the People Act
 through the Senate, some of the party&#39;s top figures are changing their tune on 
voter ID rules
 they previously called &#34;racist.&#34;
In an effort to garner bipartisan support for the act, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., has proposed a set of compromises. One would expand voter ID laws, long a legislative 
objective for the GOP
. The line from the Manchin memo: &#34;Require voter ID with allowable alternatives (utility bill, etc.) to prove identity to vote&#34;. 
When asked about the compromise on Thursday, Stacey Abrams, the former gubernatorial candidate for Georgia and Fair Fight Action founder, who has long 
railed against voter ID laws
, said she &#34;absolutely&#34; could support Manchin&#39;s proposal even if voter ID was a part of it. &#34;That&#39;s one of the fallacies of Republican talking points that have been deeply disturbing. No one has ever objected to having to prove who you are to vote. It&#39;s been part of our nation&#39;s history since the inception of voting,&#34; Abrams told CNN.  
However, many top Democrats have been deriding voter ID laws as 
suppressive and racist for years
, including Abrams. 
As recently as this past March, she referred to Georgia&#39;s recent voting-rights bills, which included expanding voter ID laws, as &#34;racist&#34; and &#34;a redux of Jim Crow in a suit and tie.&#34;
She wasn&#39;t the only one.
Also in March, President Biden mentioned that the passage of the Georiga voting bills &#34;makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle.&#34; Biden also has 
referred to voter ID laws
 as a racially charged &#34;attempt to repress minority voting masquerading as an attempt to end corruption.&#34; 
As a senator, Vice President Kamala Harris tried to sink the nomination of 5th Circuit Court Judge Kyle Duncan by criticizing him for trying to reinstate a voter ID law she called &#34;racist,&#34; noting an appeals court wrote that it &#34;targeted African-Americans with almost surgical precision.&#34;
Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., also has spoken at great length about how he believed voter ID laws were racially suppressive. &#34;Dealing with these voter ID laws, this is not about voter verification, this is about voter suppression. They’re still playing the same games,&#34; he said in a 
sermon
 at Ebenezer Baptist Church in 2015.
WARNOCK FALSELY CLAIMS HE NEVER OPPOSED VOTER ID LAWS
Furthermore, Warnock said in his first speech before the Senate, &#34;We are witnessing right now a massive and unabashed assault on voting rights unlike anything we have seen since the Jim Crow era. This is Jim Crow in new clothes.&#34; 
Now, despite his continued pummeling of voter ID laws in the past, Warnock, like Stacey Abrams, has flipped on the topic. 
&#34;I have never been opposed to voter ID,&#34; Warnock told 
NBC News
 in an interview published Thursday. &#34;And in fact, I don&#39;t know anybody who is — who believes people shouldn&#39;t have to prove that they are who they say they are.&#34; 
The recent change in the Democrats&#39; tone on voter ID could be partly because polling shows it&#39;s a popular policy among Americans. An 
Associated Press poll
 conducted in March showed 72% of Americans supported voter ID laws. 
Despite having fought for stricter voter identification policies for years, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called the Manchin proposal &#34;equally unacceptable.&#34;

McConnell said Thursday, &#34;I actually think when Stacey Abrams immediately endorsed Sen. Machin’s proposal it became the Stacey Abrams (bill), not the Joe Manchin (bill).&#34; 
The vote on the For The People Act is slated for next week. It is not expected to receive the 10 Republican votes needed to pass.

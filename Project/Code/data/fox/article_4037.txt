Georgia
 Gov. Brian Kemp banned requiring people to have 
coronavirus
 passports to enter the state via executive order Tuesday.
&#34;I thought it was important for state government to signal, look, we’re not going to have vaccine passports,&#34; Kemp told Fox News in an interview. &#34;People know what to do. We’re going to continue to encourage them to get the vaccine.&#34;

Kemp&#39;s 
order
 also bans state agencies, state service providers and state properties from requiring coronavirus vaccine passports and prohibits Georgia Registry of Immunization Transactions and Services data from being used for a coronavirus vaccine passport program.
&#34;There’s a lot of concern out there that people are going to be forced to do something with their own medical decisions,&#34; Kemp said. &#34;We do not support that.&#34;

Kemp signed an executive order 
lifting
 most of Georgia&#39;s remaining coronavirus restrictions earlier in May. More than 3.2 million Georgians are fully vaccinated, according to 
state data
.
&#34;I’ve been pushing the vaccines for a long time. I’ve been vaccinated,&#34; Kemp said. &#34;Forcing people to do something is not going to work. You need to get them to buy into what you’re selling or what your solutions are.&#34;
The 
governor
 said his 
state
 has an economic edge because many Georgia businesses never closed in the first place. He touted his state&#39;s 4.3% unemployment rate in April, the lowest number among the 10 most populated states in the U.S.

&#34;You look at the numbers, for the first time in 20 or 30 years you&#39;ve got more people moving out of California than moving in. People are flocking to places like Georgia, Florida, Tennessee,&#34; he said. &#34;Our economy is smoking right now. Our issue is we need more people in the workforce in all different sectors.&#34;
However, he&#39;s concerned about messaging around the risks of international travel. Atlanta is an international travel hub.
&#34;We’ve done pilot projects in Atlanta at the airport. There’s ways you can deal with this without saying no to international travel,&#34; he said.

Kemp is also eyeing a ban on requiring masks in schools.
&#34;We have had the availability for teachers to get vaccinated for a very long time now. I for one think it’s time for the mask mandate to come off for the kids in our schools,&#34; he said.

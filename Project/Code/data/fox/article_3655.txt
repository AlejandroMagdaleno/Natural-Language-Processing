Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on the recent report suggesting the Biden administration may not be waiting on science from the agency to justify the decision. 
The new 
coronavirus
 variant &#34;mu&#34; is not at the moment posing a great risk to Americans, according to White House chief medical adviser Dr. 
Anthony Fauci
.
&#34;We’re paying attention to it, we take everything like that seriously, but we don’t consider it an immediate threat right now,&#34; Fauci said Thursday during a White House COVID response news briefing.
COVID-19 VACCINATIONS IN RURAL AREAS HIT FASTEST PACE IN 6 WEEKS: REPORT
Earlier this week, mu, known by scientists as B.1.621, was added to the 
World Health Organization
’s (WHO) &#34;
of interest
&#34; list of variants. The variant was first identified in Colombia and has been confirmed in at least 39 countries, according to the WHO.
&#34;This variant has a constellation of mutations that suggests that it would evade certain antibodies, not only monoclonal antibodies, but vaccine- and convalescent serum-induced antibodies,&#34; Fauci said. &#34;But there isn’t a lot of clinical data to suggest that, it is mostly laboratory in-vitro data.&#34;
&#34;Remember, even when you have variants that do diminish somewhat the efficacy of vaccines, the vaccines still are quite effective against variants of that time,&#34; Fauci added in conclusion, telling Americans that health officials were &#34;keeping a very close eye&#34; on what happens with mu.

Fauci also said during the briefing that he &#34;would not at all be surprised&#34; if three doses of vaccine are required for Americans to be fully protected against the coronavirus.
&#34;I must say from my own experience as an immunologist, I would not at all be surprised that the adequate full regimen for vaccination will likely be three doses,&#34; Fauci said.
&#34;If it is durable, then you&#39;re going to have very likely a three-dose regimen being the routine regimen,&#34; Fauci said, adding he would leave it up to other officials to determine how many doses of the vaccine should be taken.

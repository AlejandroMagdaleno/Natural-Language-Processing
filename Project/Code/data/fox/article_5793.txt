U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., 
responded
 Friday to criticism from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., derisively declaring that he wasn&#39;t going to take marching orders from a 
socialist
.
&#34;Congress should proceed with caution on any additional spending and I will not vote for a reckless expansion of government programs,&#34; Manchin wrote in a statement. &#34;No op-ed from a self-declared Independent socialist is going to change that.&#34;
Earlier, Sanders had penned an op-ed for a newspaper in Manchin&#39;s home state, calling for every Democrat to support 
President Biden
&#39;s Build Back Better agenda.
&#34;Poll after poll shows overwhelming support for this legislation,&#34; Sanders wrote in the op-ed for the 
Charleston Gazette-Mail.
 &#34;Yet, the political problem we face is that in a 50-50 Senate we need every Democratic senator to vote &#39;yes,&#39; We now have only 48. Two Democratic senators remain in opposition, including Sen. Joe Manchin.&#34;

OLD TWEET COMES BACK TO HAUNT TOP BIDEN AIDE HIT FOR &#39;HIGH-CLASS PROBLEM&#39; RETWEET
Manchin said Sanders has &#34;no relationship to the state,&#34; adding that Sanders&#39; remarks did not mark the &#34;first time an out-of-stater has tried to tell West Virginians what is best for them.&#34;
&#34;Millions of jobs are open, supply chains are strained and unavoidable inflation taxes are draining workers&#39; hard-earned wages as the price of gasoline and groceries continues to climb,&#34; Manchin stated, accusing Sanders of trying to &#34;throw more money on an already overheated economy while 52 other Senators have grave concerns about this approach.&#34;

In his op-ed, Sanders, who has repeatedly pressured Manchin to help pass Biden&#39;s agenda, described the $3.5 trillion Build Back Better Act as &#34;a historic opportunity to support the working families of West Virginia, Vermont and the entire country and create policy which works for all, not just the few.&#34;
Sanders held news conferences targeting Manchin and U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., for their lack of support for the agenda, saying both senators must speak clearly about what they want out of spending negotiations.

In an 
op-ed for Fox News
 this week, Sanders offered similar comments.
&#34;Will all Democrats stand together to protect the interests of the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor?&#34; Sanders asked in the piece. &#34;Will all Democrats stand together to take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, the health insurance companies, the fossil fuel industry, and wealthy campaign contributors? I certainly hope so.&#34;
Sanders initially proposed a $6 trillion infrastructure plan, later saying that it was &#34;
probably too little
,&#34; and that the current $3.5 trillion social spending package &#34;should be a minimum.&#34;
&#34;The $6 trillion that I originally proposed was probably too little. Three and a half trillion should be a minimum. But I accept that there&#39;s going to have to be give and take,&#34; Sanders said earlier this month.
Sanders could not immediately be reached for comment.

Vice President-elect Kamala Harris
 said Thursday that last week&#39;s 
assault on the U.S. Capitol
 reminded her of the 
2017 &#34;Unite the Right&#34; rally
 in 
Charlottesville, Va
.
In an interview on NPR, the former 
Democratic
 
California
 
senator
 said photographs of rioters 
carrying the Confederate flag
 and wearing 
&#34;Camp Auschwitz&#34; hoodies
 reminded her of images taken during the white nationalist demonstrations that eventually turned deadly.

&#34;It was the same thing that went through my mind when I saw Charlottesville,&#34;

&#34;Sadly, it is not the first time I have seen a demonstration like what you are describing in the history of our country,&#34; Harris said. &#34;And it is -- it is a reminder that we still have a lot of work to do.&#34;

&#34;It was a day that wherein we witnessed an assault on America&#39;s democracy, a day when we witnessed the 
terror
 that a few can wreak on so many,&#34; she noted. &#34;And it was probably, you know, it will be in history recorded as one of the worst days in terms of an attack on the integrity of our democracy.&#34;
&#34;I think that we cannot yield to those who would try and make us afraid of who we are,&#34; Harris concluded. &#34;We are, for all of our faults and imperfections, we are a nation that was founded on very important principles and guided by extremely important ideals. And we cannot abandon that.&#34;

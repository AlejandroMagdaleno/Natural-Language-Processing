House Judiciary Chairman Rep. 
Jerry Nadler
 denied Rep. 
Matt Gaetz’s
 request to begin each meeting with the Pledge of Allegiance saying the committee is &#34;covered&#34; as the House already begins each day with it. 
Gaetz, R-Fla., asked that &#34;in the spirit of national unity and pride,&#34; the Judiciary Committee begin each meeting with the Pledge.
Gaetz, who’s made a name for himself as a spirited Trump loyalist, said that in these divided times, it would signal a &#34;great, unifying patriotic moment.&#34;
&#34;It&#39;s unnecessary,&#34; Nadler shot back. &#34;The House begins every day with the Pledge of Allegiance, we&#39;re covered by that.&#34;
LINDSEY GRAHAM WARNS STRIPPING GREENE OF COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS &#39;WILL SET A TERRIBLE PRECEDENT&#39; 
The pledge became a part of the House daily order of business in 1988. 
Nadler said it’s not necessary to say it twice during the same day, saying, &#34;It’s not in our practice to do so.&#34; 
&#34;I appreciate the gentleman&#39;s suggestion but we are covered by the House,&#34; Nadler said. &#34;We all say the Pledge of Allegiance every day.&#34;
Gaetz and Nadler have butted heads on the committee numerous times, from the Mueller investigation to matters of President Trump’s impeachment. 
Some took Gaetz’s request as &#34;virtue signaling,&#34; while others thought Nadler’s response made the pledge seem like an obligation. 
&#34;I proposed that we begin each meeting of the House Judiciary Committee by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Democrats just said ‘no,&#39;&#34; Gaetz wrote on Twitter of the incident. 
&#34;I believe this is what some might call &#39;virtue-signalling,&#39;&#34; podcast host Cody Johnston quote-tweeted Gaetz.

&#34;Nadler’s response that they’re &#39;covered&#39; by the daily House recitation of the pledge is so halakhic. It’s like kiddush — hear it once, you’ve fulfilled the mitzvah,&#34; Huffington Post reporter Daniel Marans replied to Gaetz&#39;s tweet.

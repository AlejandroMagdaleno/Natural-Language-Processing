FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo joins Laura Ingraham for another edition of &#39;Friday Follies&#39;
First lady 
Jill Biden
 visited a 
New Jersey
 elementary 
school
 classroom on Monday where just two students were learning in-person and 17 were learning virtually.
The visit came as Biden touted her husband&#39;s newly signed legislation providing COVID-19 relief, including funding for schools to reopen. 
Two male students were in the classroom with Biden and playing a game, according to a pool report. Biden squatted behind the two in-person students and sat down at a computer to greet those attending virtually.
&#34;Hello, nice to see all of you,&#34; she said at Samuel Smith Elementary School in Burlington. &#34;I’m a teacher too but I teach English. Tomorrow I will be doing the exact same thing with my students.&#34;
CDC LOOKING &#39;CAREFULLY&#39; AT CORONAVIRUS DISTANCING GUIDELINES FOR SCHOOLS, WALENSKY SAYS
Her visit comes as parents and politicians across the country grew concerned about the pace of reopening, a process that continues to face roadblocks a year into the pandemic.
&#34;I&#39;m here to tell you with the American Rescue Plan, help is here,&#34; the first lady said during a press conference outside of the school. 
Biden told educators: &#34;Even with your best efforts, students can&#39;t come -- they can&#39;t come in every day, which means that their parents are still having to take time off work or figure out child care solutions.&#34;

&#34;And this school, like schools across the country, can&#39;t fully reopen without help,&#34; she added, declaring that &#34;we&#39;re going to open schools and we&#39;re going to do it safely.&#34;
That particular school had welcomed students for in-person learning on a voluntary basis in October but switched to all remote in November. About half the students currently attend two days a week for in-person learning.

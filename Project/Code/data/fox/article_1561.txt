FOX News media analyst and &#39;Media Buzz&#39; host Howard Kurtz has the details on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
, is criticizing 
President-elect Biden&#39;s
 new coronavirus relief, arguing that it doesn&#39;t go far enough to help people in need during the 
pandemic
.
Biden&#39;s stimulus plan, which includes the increased payments, would cost $1.9 trillion. According to 
The Washington Post
, most people would end up with a total of $2,000 in stimulus, including $600 checks dispensed in recent legislation.
But that wasn&#39;t enough for Ocasio-Cortez, who appeared to want the latest checks to reach $2,000 as she and others have repeatedly requested. &#34;$2,000 means $2,000. $2,000 does not mean $1,400,″ she told the Post.
Biden pledged before the Georgia runoffs this month that a Democratic Senate would pass $2,000 stimulus checks.

In a follow up tweet, Ocasio-Cortez argued that Congress should proivde retroactive unemployment relief, in addition to the $400 per week that Biden included in his latest proposal. Biden&#39;s proposal also expanded from $500 to $1,500 the Earned Income Tax Credit.
With Democrats controlling both chambers and the White House after November&#39;s elections, it appeared more likely they could pass a stimulus package.

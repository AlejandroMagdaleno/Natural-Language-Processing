Retired surgeon joins &#39;Tucker Carlson Today&#39; for discussion on safety concerns, efficacy
Retired surgeon and former U-Penn Medicine professor Dr. Hooman Noorchashm warned that orchestrating a blanket 
coronavirus
 
vaccination
 for every American regardless of prior immunity or presence of risk factors could be a &#34;dangerous medical approach.&#34;
Noorchashm told 
Fox Nation&#39;s
 &#34;Tucker Carlson Today&#34; that patients shouldn&#39;t fear asking legitimate questions about the vaccine, immunity status or the 
vaccine
 &#34;passport&#34; system already being deployed in places like 
New York
.
FOX NATION DIGS INTO THE CURSE OF TIPPECANOE
&#34;When folks in the public health arena, talk about the vaccine efficacy. I think it’s a good bet that our science, this is American science... says to us that neutralizing antibodies and prime T cells can clear this out of your body,&#34; he said.
&#34;Now the question is, have we done enough to make sure it’s safe in everyone. Are there categories in subset of people in whom this vaccine may actually pose some sort of risk? -- I think the answer to that is yes.&#34;
&#34;They delivered an effective vaccine. Now, the safety part of it is what they&#39;re making a mistake with: It&#39;s a mistake to be vaccinating people who have had recent or current infections.&#34;
Noorchashm called for a &#34;logical and rational&#34; approach, considering both natural and vaccine immunity to coronavirus.
SURGEON TELLS TUCKER COVID VACCINE IS &#39;POWERFUL AND EFFECTIVE&#39;, BUT &#39;NOT A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL&#39;
&#34;If someone is natural immune there’s no reason to go and re-vaccinate them, those persons would actually be an unnecessary medical procedure ... This is a very unusual thing,&#34; he said.
&#34;We are a literally in the middle of an outbreak where millions of American are naturally infected, or naturally immune. Deploying a vaccine that essentially reactivates the immune responses. So the question is number one is that necessary medical treatment? Number two is that a dangerous medical approach?&#34;

Noorchashm previously told Fox News Channel&#39;s 
&#34;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#34;
 last month that while the 
coronavirus
 
vaccine
 should be viewed as a medical miracle, applying a &#34;one-size-fits-all&#34; approach, as many experts are, could cause more harm to some patients.
He insisted that he is not stoking &#34;vaccine hesitancy&#34; but instead calling for both the government and citizens to use critical thinking.

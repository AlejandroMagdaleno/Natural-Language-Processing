The city of 
Frostproof, Fla.
, has declared the first week of February &#34;
Donald J. Trump
 Week&#34; in honor of the former president, who remains a popular figure in the area.
&#34;Former President Donald J. Trump was overwhelmingly supported, and received 76.43% of the votes in Frostproof, Fla., Precinct 537, won the state of Florida twice and received more votes than any incumbent in United States history,&#34; the proclamation from Mayor Jon Albert reads.
The proclamation praised Trump for his record on jobs – touting 1.2 million in manufacturing and construction during his term – and his foreign policy, which &#34;engaged in no new wars&#34; and brought some troops home from abroad.

CAN THE SENATE STOP TRUMP FROM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN?
Donald J. Trump week runs this year from Feb. 1 to 6.
State Rep. Anthony Sabatini, who has proposed renaming U.S. Route 27 as &#34;President Donald J. Trump Highway,&#34; spoke in support of the proclamation and called it &#34;a great initiative.&#34;
&#34;First city in the nation to do this,&#34; he noted in a Facebook post.
Critics of the move said they disagree with its timing, during the first week of Black History Month, according to the 
Tampa Bay Times
.
&#34;I voted for Trump, but I feel this is stirring the pot,&#34; White city resident Aimee Ward told the paper. &#34;If they declared Trump Day on his birthday in June, I wouldn’t think twice. Doing this on Black History Month is absolutely unacceptable.&#34;
&#34;I don’t think it’s fair it’s turned into a race issue,&#34; James Ring, a local Republican Party official, told the paper. &#34;I don’t think there was any ill intent on behalf of the City Council.&#34;

It’s not unusual to honor past presidents during February. The third Monday of the month is Presidents Day.
Four former presidents were born during the month of February: George Washington, William Henry Harrison, Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.

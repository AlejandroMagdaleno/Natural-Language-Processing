California gubernatorial candidate Caitlyn Jenner argues Gov. Gavin Newsom has &#39;absolutely destroyed hope&#39; as companies and people move out of the state.
California Republican gubernatorial candidate Caitlyn Jenner said this week that money from the state’s bullet train project should be redirected to &#34;completely finish the wall&#34; on California&#39;s U.S.-Mexico border. 
&#34;Right now we’re spending billions on a high-speed train to nowhere,&#34; Jenner told 
KABC,
 referring to California’s years-long bullet train project. &#34;Take some of that money, go down to the border wall and completely finish on state land,&#34; Jenner said. &#34;Completely finish the wall. We need protection.&#34; 
She added: &#34;But, for those hardworking great people that are here, I want them to be able to get legal status.&#34; 
CAITLYN JENNER ‘STRONGLY’ SUPPORTS BORDER WALL
Jenner, a reality television star, businesswoman, and gold medalist, discussed immigration in an interview this week saying the wall, Trump’s paramount 2016 campaign promise, should be finished. 
Last month, Jenner said she &#34;strongly&#34; supports the border wall, and said as governor she would end California’s status as a &#34;sanctuary state,&#34; and work to fix a &#34;broken immigration system. 
&#34;I would see to it that violent illegal criminals are DEPORTED IMMEDIATELY,&#34; Jenner said in an email to supporters last month. 
Jenner also told Fox News’ Sean Hannity last month she is &#34;all for the wall.&#34; 
&#34;I am all for the wall, I would secure the wall. We can&#39;t have a state, we can&#39;t have a country, without a secure wall,&#34; she said. 
Jenner also seemed to support undocumented immigrants living in the country. 
&#34;You have two questions here,&#34; she said. &#34;One is stopping people from coming in illegally into the state. And then the second question is, what do we do with the people that are here? We are a compassionate country, okay? We are a compassionate state.&#34;
&#34;I mean, some people we&#39;re going to send back, OK, no question about that,&#34; she added. &#34;But I have met some of the greatest immigrants into our country.&#34;
President Biden, upon taking office, stopped construction of the wall along the U.S.-Mexico Border; but in April, the Department of Homeland Security said it is working to fix what it described as &#34;dangerous erosion&#34; along a 14-mile stretch of border wall construction in California. 
DHS specified that it is working to &#34;remediate dangerous soil erosion&#34; in San Diego, which it looped in as part of a number of measures to address the damage that it blamed on the prior administration’s wall construction.
GROWING OPPOSITION IN CALIFORNIA TO NEWSOM RECALL, POLL SHOWS
&#34;Improper compaction of soil and construction materials along a wall segment constructed by the prior administration is causing dangerous erosion along a 14-mile stretch in San Diego, California,&#34; it said in an 
April 30 statement
. &#34;DHS will begin necessary backfill projects to ensure the safety of nearby border communities.&#34;
Meanwhile, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has sought to tie Jenner to Trump— but she said this week that she didn’t vote for the former commander-in-chief during the 2020 presidential election. 
&#34;He did some really good things with the economy for this state, international. He did some good things,&#34; Jenner said. &#34;His messaging was terrible.&#34; 
&#34;I feel like I’m the face of the Republican Party for the future,&#34; Jenner said. &#34;I want to bring the Republican Party to me and be more inclusive.&#34;

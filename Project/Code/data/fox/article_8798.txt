Texas Lt. Gov Dan Patrick slams millionaire Beto O&#39;Rourke&#39;s claim Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is &#39;sacrificing the lives of our fellow Texans&#39; for political gain. 
Texas Lt. Gov Dan Patrick
, R., slammed 
Joe Biden&#39;s
 &#34;
Neanderthal thinking
&#34; comment on lifting COVID-19 restrictions on &#34;
The Faulkner Focus
&#34; on Thursday, calling the president a &#34;hypocrite.&#34;
Biden took a swipe at Republican governors in 
Texas
 and 
Mississippi 
Wednesday, accusing them of &#34;
Neanderthal thinking
&#34; following their decision to reverse coronavirus safety policies, including mask mandates.
&#34;How dare him attack Texas for our policies when he is allowing the border to be overrun by people coming in here by the hundreds, by the thousands and 
testing positive 
and coming on a bus to your state wherever you happen to live in the United States of America,&#34; Patrick said. &#34;What a hypocrite.&#34; 
WHITE HOUSE &#39;PROTECTING&#39; BIDEN BY NOT SCHEDULING PRESS CONFERENCES: KARL ROVE
More than 100 illegal
 immigrants 
released by the Border Patrol into Texas since January have
 tested positive
 for 
COVID-19
 following their arrival, officials on the U.S.-Mexico border told Fox News. 
Felipe Romero, a spokesperson for Brownsville, said Wednesday the 108 positives represent 6.3% of the number of total migrants who have been rapid-tested at the city’s main bus station, where they are being released by the Border Patrol. Rapid testing of the individuals began there on Jan. 25. 
He added Brownsville does not have the authority to prevent those who test positive from traveling elsewhere in the U.S. and is advising them to quarantine, follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, and socially distance. 
TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT ANNOUNCES PLAN TO FULLY REOPEN BUSINESSES, END STATE MASK MANDATE
Sources at the White House told Fox News on Wednesday it is aware of instances where individuals may continue to travel despite testing positive and being told to quarantine, yet the federal guidance remains for them to isolate.
&#34;What I would call ‘Neanderthal thinking’ would be Governor [Gavin] 
Newsom
 in California telling his people not to come out of their cave for a year,&#34; Patrick said.  &#34;I would call &#39;Neanderthal thinking&#39; the Democrat Governor [Andrew] 
Cuomo
 of New York sending patients with COVID to 
nursing homes
 where he 
covered up
 12,000 people dying.&#34; 
He added, &#34;I would call ‘Neanderthal thinking’ of allowing people to cross the border illegally with COVID.&#34; 
Patrick went on to say that Biden &#34;didn’t look at the facts,&#34; noting 15 other states don&#39;t have a mask mandate. He added people were still encouraged to socially distance.
&#34;We just joined that group,&#34; he said. &#34;We’re not telling people not to wear masks. We’re just removing a mandate.&#34;

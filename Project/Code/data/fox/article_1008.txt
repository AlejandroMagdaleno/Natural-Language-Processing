Kristen Clarke sits for confirmation hearing as assistant attorney general nominee for DOJ Civil Rights Division.
Justice Department
 nominee 
Kristen Clarke
 defended her past writings and said an op-ed she wrote while in college stating that Black people are superior was satirical, after Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, raised concerns over the piece.
During Clarke&#39;s confirmation hearing as nominee for assistant attorney general for the DOJ&#39;s Civil Rights Division, Cornyn asked if Clarke agrees with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#39;s dream that people would be judged on their character instead of skin color. After she confirmed that she does, the senator brought up the op-ed, which appeared in the 
Harvard Crimson
.

&#34;I believe you’re referring to an op-ed that I wrote at the age of 19 about the Bell Curve Theory, a racist book that equated DNA with genetics and race,&#34; Clarke said, referencing the 1994 book.
Clarke stated that as a Black student at Harvard at the time, she and others were offended by the book, which was co-authored by a Harvard professor, Richard J. Hernstein. She explained that her op-ed attempted to point out the flaws in the book by putting forth another offensive idea.
&#34;This op-ed opened with a satirical reference to the statement that you just noted,&#34; Clarke told Cornyn. The op-ed put forth the idea that Blacks are superior due to higher levels of melanin.
Clarke noted Wednesday that reporting in the campus newspaper at the time &#34;made very clear&#34; that the op-ed did not represent her actual views. &#34;What I was seeking to do was hold up a mirror and put one racist theory alongside another to challenge people as to why we were unwilling to wholly reject the racist theory that defined the Bell Curve book,&#34; she said.

Clarke has faced a number of accusations from Republicans regarding her viewpoints. A university transcript obtained by the 
American Accountability Foundation
 and given to Fox News showed that when she was a student at Columbia Law School in 1999, she was instrumental in organizing an event where activists supported the freeing of death row inmates, whom they referred to as &#34;political prisoners.&#34;
The list included people convicted for a wide array of crimes, including convicted cop-killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and Assata Shakur, and other radical extremists like  
Susan Rosenberg
, who was convicted for transporting multiple illegal firearms and over 740 pounds of explosives.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pushed back on the attacks waged against Clarke.
&#34;Sadly, some are so threatened by a revitalized Civil Rights Division that they have already engaged in baseless attacks on this extremely well-qualified nominee,&#34; Durbin said, pointing to allegations that she is &#34;anti-police&#34;and anti-Semitic, the latter of which he noted was rejected by Attorney General Merrick Garland, who during his own confirmation hearing spoke about how his own family escaped anti-Semitism in Europe.

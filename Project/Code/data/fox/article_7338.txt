White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki acknowledged Tuesday that President 
Joe Biden
&#39;s Build Back Better agenda will carry a cost, saying the White House is asking top earners in America to &#34;pay more&#34; to cover the costs of it.
In a question from a reporter, Psaki was asked whether the Biden Administration would &#34;acknowledge the broader truth that it does cost somebody? Right?&#34;
&#34;There&#39;s a clear difference to what we&#39;re talking about as it relates to taxpayer funds or funding that would lead to our debt, right, which I know a lot of Republicans are supposedly concerned about&#34; Psaki said. &#34;Fifty of the top companies last year in 2020 paid not a dollar in taxes. A lot of high-income individuals pay lower tax rates than nurses and teachers. No one thinks that&#39;s fair. Yes, we&#39;re asking them to pay more. Yes, it will cost them more.&#34;
Biden 
faced criticism
 from analysts and lawmakers over the weekend after he shared a tweet claiming that his Build Back Better plan &#34;costs zero dollars.&#34;
&#34;My Build Back Better Agenda costs zero dollars,&#34; Biden&#39;s account tweeted. &#34;Instead of wasting money on tax breaks, loopholes, and tax evasion for big corporations and the wealthy, we can make a once-in-a-generation investment in working America. And it adds zero dollars to the national debt.&#34;
Republicans have 
ripped
 Build Back Better, which includes a $3.5 trillion spending package, as a massive bill that &#34;ultimately provides benefits to wealthy liberal elites at the expense of working-class families.&#34; 
Moderate Democrats, like Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., have also 
raised concerns
 about the package, the latter noting the bill lacks cost analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.
&#34;I don’t think we can afford everything,&#34; Murphy said. &#34;Unless something changes, I have no choice but to vote no on every subtitle [n the bill] and on final passage.&#34;

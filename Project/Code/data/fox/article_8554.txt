Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., addresses next steps of action involving New York governor undercounting the number of coronavirus deaths in elder care facilities.
Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is calling for a federal investigation into New York 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo
&#39;s administration, which has been slammed for undercounting 
coronavirus
-related nursing home deaths.
The congresswoman told &#34;
Justice with Jeanine Pirro
&#34; Saturday she believes New York Commissioner of Health Dr. Howard Zucker should resign from his post after the state’s Attorney General Letitia James released a 
report
 Thursday suggesting the Department of Health could have miscounted deaths by nearly 50%.
Stefanik then called for the resignation of Gov. Cuomo himself if a federal investigation into the claims proves a &#34;criminal coverup.&#34;
WASHINGTON POST RIPS CUOMO&#39;S &#39;WHO CARES?&#39; REMARK ON NURSING HOME DEATHS: &#39;WE SHOULD CARE&#39;
&#34;I want to see a federal investigation because I think there were criminal acts conducted by the governor, by his senior staff. I want a very public and transparent investigation,&#34; she said. &#34;I think he should resign if there&#39;s a criminal coverup, which I believe there is.&#34;
James, a Democrat, would be responsible for bringing a grand jury investigation. Stefanik said it was encouraging that the state attorney general launched the investigation in the first place.
&#34;What was most telling ... they knew the numbers, they put them out the same day, which shows they were trying to cover them up,&#34; she said.

&#34;There are more questions than answers when you look at the 76-page report,&#34; she continued. &#34;This is the beginning of pursuit to justice, not the end. I would urge the attorney general to continue moving that process forward.&#34;
Stefanik also urged state government to issue subpoenas &#34;immediately&#34; to investigate the scandal further, stressing that there must be &#34;accountability and consequences.&#34;
The congresswoman called on President Biden to support an independent investigation, and &#34;not play politics&#34; with it.

&#34;This is why the governor has been able to stonewall is because they have not issued those subpoenas.&#34;
&#34;This has been not just a nursing home scandal but a criminal coverup,&#34; she said, &#34;a corruption scandal at the highest levels of New York state government.&#34;

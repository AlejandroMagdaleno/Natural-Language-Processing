The 
Pentagon
 is requiring members of the U.S. military to get vaccinated against 
coronavirus
.
All military troops will have until Sept. 15 to get vaccinated, according to a memo sent by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to all Department of Defense employees. It could be even sooner depending on developments regarding vaccine approval or the spread of COVID-19.
WHITE HOUSE DOESN&#39;T DENY IT IS CONSIDERING WITHHOLDING FUNDS TO FORCE VACCINATIONS
&#34;I will seek the president’s approval to make the vaccines mandatory no later than mid-September, or immediately upon [FDA approval] whichever comes first,&#34; Austin said in the memo, which went out to troops on Monday.
&#34;I will not hesitate to act sooner or recommend a different course to the President if l feel the need to do so,&#34; Austin added. &#34;To defend this Nation, we need a healthy and ready force.&#34;
The Pfizer vaccine is expected to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration in early September. Should that not happen, Austin could seek a presidential waiver to require troops to get the vaccine.

Austin encouraged all employees to get vaccinated right away, regardless of the requirement.
&#34;To defend this Nation, we need a healthy and ready force. I strongly encourage all DoD military and civilian personnel - as well as contractor personnel - to get vaccinated now and for military Service members to not wait for the mandate,&#34; he said.

&#34;I strongly support Secretary Austin’s message to the Force today on the Department of Defense’s plan to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the list of required vaccinations for our service members not later than mid-September,&#34; Biden said. &#34;Secretary Austin and I share an unshakable commitment to making sure our troops have every tool they need to do their jobs as safely as possible.&#34;

So far, more than 74% of the Navy have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Other branches of the military lag behind, with 65% of active duty Air Force members and 60% of Air Force reserves having had at least one shot. In the Army, that number is closer to 50%, the AP reported.
Unvaccinated troops currently have to follow protocols that include wearing masks, maintaining social distance, and abiding by travel restrictions.

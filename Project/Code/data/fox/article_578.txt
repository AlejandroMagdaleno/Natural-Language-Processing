His response came after Tlaib tweeted Monday that she was &#34;done with those who condone government-funded murder.&#34;
&#34;No more policing, incarceration, and militarization. It can&#39;t be reformed,&#34; she wrote.
The &#34;Squad&#34; member also called policing in our country, &#34;inherently &amp; intentionally racist.&#34;
This week, House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi

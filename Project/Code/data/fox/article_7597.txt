Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Az,, discusses the likely impeachment this week of President Trump on &#39;Outnumbered Overtime.&#39;
Arizona
 
Republican
 
Rep. Andy Biggs
 is mulling a 
Senate
 run against newly appointed 
Democratic
 Sen. Mark Kelly. 
In a Tuesday interview with Fox News, the three-term 
congressman
 said that he had been examining 
polling data
 and consulting knowledgeable parties both in 
Washington, D.C.
, and in the Copper State to better understand his viability as a potential 
candidate
. 
&#34;This has kind of developed,&#34; he explained. &#34;I mean, I was very supportive of 
Martha McSally
 in her run. I wanted her to win badly and then when that didn&#39;t happen I began to look [into it].&#34;
ARIZONA SENATE PANEL APPROVES DOWN SYNDROME ABORTION BAN, OTHER ANTI-ABORTION MEASURES
Then-Sen. Martha McSally was 
bested by Kelly
, losing the race with a 
margin of just over 2 percentage points
. 
Kelly was sworn in in December
 after 
Arizona flipped blue
 for the first time in decades. 
The pivotal special election -- which garnered national attention due to both the balance of the upper chamber and eventual 
confirmation of Supreme Court Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett
 -- wound up being one of the most expensive in history, with 
Kelly raising $101 million
, 
according to the Federal Elections Committee
.
It&#39;s a seat that&#39;s likely to be closely guarded by Democrats once more come the 2022 primaries. 
Biggs said his initial concern about Kelly was regarding some of the former 
NASA astronaut&#39;s
 
political positions
 -- which included supporting upholding protections for pre-existing health conditions and 
stricter gun reform
 -- though he noted that a lot would be revealed over the next 18 months. 
Regardless, the 
House Freedom Caucus
 chairman said his message could relate to Arizonans and that he could be &#34;very successful&#34; in helping the Senate implement the &#34;panoply of things&#34; they do including judicial appointments and 
foreign policy
.
&#34;I think my message would be we want to ... have fewer 
taxes
, we want to have less regulation, we want to make Arizona and the United States a great place to live, and trade, and do business,&#34; Biggs said. &#34;We want to control our 
borders
.&#34;
Biggs, a staunch supporter of 
former President Donald Trump
, added that a lot of Arizonans really liked Trump-era policies.

&#34;So, I have not spoken to him directly about this,&#34; Biggs said, referring to his interest in the seat. &#34;I think [Trump still] has a lot of supporters in Arizona, for sure. I think his policies are really, really popular in Arizona. So, even some people who may not appreciate his style, for instance, may like his policy.&#34;
&#34;They like lower taxes, less regulation, or America First, you know, control the border, pro-life, his success of his foreign policy where you saw the 
Abraham Accords
 and you saw some stability going in the [
Middle East
],&#34; he mused. &#34;And, I think that&#39;s extremely popular with Arizonans.&#34;
Speaking at 
Florida&#39;s 2021 Conservative Political Action Conference
, Trump himself announced his and the Republican Party&#39;s fight to regain control is &#34;far from being over&#34; and that he might 
&#34;even decide to beat them for a third time.&#34;
Nevertheless, the demographics in the Grand Canyon State 
have shifted
 over the past couple of years. 
Maricopa County -- the state&#39;s largest county and home to its capital -- was a prime example, with the addition of young voters, transplants, and Hispanic voters which made up about one-third of its 4.7 million residents, 
according to U.S. census data

REP. ANDY BIGGS DENIES ALLEGATIONS THAT HE HELPED ORGANIZE CAPITOL INSURRECTION
Some 200,000 new residents had moved into the Grand Canyon State since 2016, 
The Hill reported in November
.
In 
a piece in The Arizona Republic
 published Monday, Jessica Taylor -- the Senate editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report -- asserted that a candidate like Biggs would misread this new Arizona electorate. 
Biggs, who represents the 5th Congressional District, was notably one of the Republicans who sought to challenge Arizona&#39;s presidential electors. 
That said, he 
denounced the violence
 during the 
Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol
 that left five dead and has maintained 
he was not involved
 with &#34;Stop the Steal&#34; organizer Ali Alexander.
Biggs, however, said he believed he was fair-minded -- especially in his time serving as Arizona Senate president -- and would go out to talk to voters in the battleground state. 
&#34;Nothing&#39;s ever given. Nothing&#39;s ever taken for granted. You have to go out and talk to people and then work with them,&#34; he said. &#34;And, I&#39;m willing to do that. If I make the decision, I will be willing to do that.&#34;
Biggs told Fox News that he recognized that Kelly would likely have more 
money
 than him, saying &#34;that&#39;s just the way it is.&#34; 
The Arizona Republic reported that Biggs had raised $1.7 million in the two-year 2020 election cycle.
&#34;But, I believe that this isn&#39;t a question of having the same amount of money because, at some point, it&#39;s overkill. But, I think I can have enough to be competitive and get my message out...&#34; he said, thought highlighting once more that this discussion was hypothetical.

He said that Republicans are in a great position to come back at that Democrats&#39; radicalized leftist positions &#34;should give any voter cause.&#34; 
&#34;Here&#39;s the doggone thing. You can get to the general, you&#39;ve got to win a primary, and I think I could win a primary,&#34; Biggs remarked. &#34;But...Mr. Kelly and I would be fighting over very probably that same [wave] of voters. ... And, we can do that and we&#39;ll see how that plays out. But, for now I&#39;m just shopping it around...&#34;
No Republicans have officially entered the race yet, though polling 
obtained by The Hill on Monday
 reportedly shows Biggs with a sizeable lead in the primary.
A spokesman for Kelly declined to comment.

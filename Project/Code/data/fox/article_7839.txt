 over a recent report that tens of thousands of migrants caught illegally crossing the border were released without court dates, the vast majority of whom haven&#39;t appeared at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) offices as directed.
Axios reported on Tuesday that the Biden administration released 50,000 undocumented migrants into the U.S. since March, with only 13% of them appearing to the ICE officials they’re supposed to meet.
AMERICA FIRST LEGAL DEMANDS INFO ON BIDEN’S ‘EXTREME’ OPEN BORDER POLICIES: ‘THE RAILS HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF’
The Biden administration’s decision to release illegal migrants into the U.S. without a notice to appear in court is an unprecedented move, Axios 
noted
. Migrants are instead given a list of ICE office addresses and contacts, being told to go to one of them.
Stephen Miller, a former adviser to former President Trump, told Fox News in an exclusive Tuesday statement that the report &#34;is just the tip of the iceberg from the data that we need.&#34;
&#34;But again, that&#39;s all it is, a snapshot. We need all of the data pertaining to this administration&#39;s catch and release policy,&#34; Miller continued. &#34;Every piece of it, so that we can have total accountability and we can have a complete public awareness.&#34;
Miller said that we &#34;shouldn’t have to scrap and claw in order to get these little snippets leaking out in stories&#34; and quipped it was if as &#34;though it was beneath the dignity of the Biden administration to provide this information to the public.&#34;
&#34;They have an affirmative obligation and duty to inform and advise the American public what they are doing in the public&#39;s name and with public taxpayer dollars and with public resources,&#34; Miller continued. &#34;We all welcome every time there is a leak that can begin to shed some additional light on this open borders scheme.&#34;
&#34;The government itself needs to release official data pertaining to the extent, the scope, and the pervasiveness of catch and release across the entire southwestern border of the United States,&#34; he added.
A plethora of Republicans shared similar sentiments, with Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, calling the border crisis a &#34;complete disaster&#34; and calling on the president and Vice President Harris to secure the border.
Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also weighed in on Twitter, writing that &#34;[c]atch and release is Biden’s official policy&#34; and accused the administration of &#34;trying to sneak through massive amnesty.&#34;
&#34;The #BidenBorderCrisis is no longer a border state problem,&#34; Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., tweeted. &#34;Illegal aliens flooding our border are coming to a town near you.&#34;
Other Republicans tore into the president, as well.
The crisis at the southern border continues to grow more intense as critics grow louder in regards to the Biden administration&#39;s handling of the issue.

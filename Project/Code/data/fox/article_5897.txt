Republicans
 condemned Rep. 
Maxine Waters
, D-Calif., for telling protesters in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, to &#34;get more confrontational&#34; if Derek Chauvin isn&#39;t convicted of murdering 
George Floyd
.
Brooklyn Center – not far from Minneapolis, where Chauvin&#39;s trial is being held – has become a flashpoint for protests after the fatal police shooting of Daunte Wright. Waters was there on Saturday night.
MAXINE WATERS URGES MINNESOTA ANTI-POLICE CROWD TO ‘STAY ON THE STREET’ IF CHAUVIN ACQUITTED IN FLOYD CASE
Asked about the Chauvin case, Waters told reporters if the former police officer isn&#39;t found guilty of murdering Floyd, &#34;We&#39;ve got to stay on the street and we&#39;ve got to get more active, we&#39;ve got to get more confrontational. We&#39;ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.&#34;
Waters said she was &#34;hopeful&#34; Chauvin would be convicted of murder, but if he isn&#39;t, &#34;we cannot go away.&#34;

Republicans were quick to push back.
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., announced an effort Sunday to expel Waters from Congress.
In a statement released by her office, Taylor Greene accused the California Congresswoman of inciting &#34;Black Lives Matter domestic terrorists to fire gunshots at National Guardsmen in Minnesota&#34; after she 
spoke 
in Brooklyn Center, which has become a flashpoint for protests following the fatal police shooting of Daunte Wright. 
&#34;I&#39;ll be introducing a resolution to expel Rep. Maxine Waters from Congress for her continual incitement of violence,&#34; a statement from Taylor Greene&#39;s office reads.
&#34;Telling rioters who have burned buildings, looted stores, and assaulted journalists to get &#39;more confrontational&#39; is incredibly irresponsible. Every House Democrat should condemn Maxine Waters&#39; call for violence,&#34; National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Berg told Fox News.
&#34;Why is Maxine Waters traveling to a different state trying to incite a riot? What good can come from this?&#34; Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., wrote on Twitter.
&#34;The Radical Left don’t care if your towns are burning, if there’s violence in your streets, or if the police are too defunded to defend their communities. As long as the Left appeases their anti-America base, their job is done,&#34; Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., wrote on 
Twitter
.
&#34;Why is a sitting member of Congress encouraging protesters to get &#39;confrontational?&#39;&#34; Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., wrote on 
Twitter
.
Waters said she plans to stay in Minnesota until Monday when closing arguments are expected in the Chauvin trial, New York Times reporter Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs 
reported
. 
&#34;The way to get in control is not to allow them to win,&#34; Waters said of political opponents, in comments that aired 
on FOX 9 in Minneapolis
. &#34;You&#39;ve got to register and you&#39;ve got to vote and you&#39;ve got to take the power.&#34;
She told MSNBC that she was in Minnesota to be &#34;auntie Maxine&#34; and support young people of color.
&#34;We have to give support to our young people who are struggling and trying to make this justice system work for everybody. They see their peers being killed. Minneapolis is a great example of what&#39;s wrong with the criminal justice system, what&#39;s wrong with policing,&#34; she told MSNBC on Sunday. &#34;I wanted to be there as auntie Maxine to show them, not only do I love them and support them, but they can count on me to be with them at this terrible time in all of our lives.&#34;

Waters has a history of in-your-face remarks and impassioned statements.
In 2018, she called for her supporters to &#34;create a crowd&#34; and to &#34;push back&#34; on members of the Trump administration in public.
&#34;Let&#39;s make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd,&#34; Waters said. &#34;And you push back on them. And you tell them they&#39;re not welcome anymore, anywhere.&#34;

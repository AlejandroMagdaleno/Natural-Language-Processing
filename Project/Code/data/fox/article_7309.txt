Members of the 
Problem Solvers Caucus 
on Tuesday announced their support of the $973 billion infrastructure deal proposed last month by a 
bipartisan group of senators. 
The caucus, which is comprised of a bipartisan group of 58 representatives, said it &#34;strongly supports&#34; the Senate 
infrastructure framework
 that is &#34;closely aligned with our own ‘Building Bridges’ proposal.&#34;
Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., a co-chair from the caucus, said the group worked with colleagues in the Senate on the framework.

&#34;With this new endorsement, there’s an even greater chance that we can get a stand-alone, bipartisan infrastructure package across the finish line,&#34; he said in a statement.
Fox News was told the caucus’ decision to approve passed with 75% of the vote, with each party passing 50% in support. The caucus endorsed the infrastructure bill as a stand-alone bill and not tied to any reconciliation package. 
The $973 billion bipartisan deal includes money to build a national network of electric vehicle charging stations, purchase thousands of electric buses and upgrade the electrical grid. It also would spend $55 billion to improve drinking water and wastewater systems and $47 billion in resiliency efforts to tackle climate change.

Democrats want the bill tied to a reconciliation package that some have said could cost $6 trillion with a focus on climate change. Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., want both bills unattached.
&#34;You know if you’re really serious about this, let’s look at traditional infrastructure and that is roads, bridges, rural broadband … and not muck it up with things that have nothing to do with infrastructure,&#34; Rep. 
Michael McCaul
, R-Texas, told &#34;
Fox News Sunday.

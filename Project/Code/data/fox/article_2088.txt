Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg maintains President Biden&#39;s $2.25 trillion infrastructure spending proposal is necessary for job creation, arguing that 2.7 million more jobs would be added &#39;than if we don&#39;t do the plan.&#39;
&#34;
Fox News Sunday
&#34; anchor Chris Wallace on Sunday grilled Transportation Secretary 
Pete Buttigieg
 for exaggerating the number of jobs that would be created by President Biden&#39;s $2 trillion-plus spending proposal.
Wallace noted that Buttigieg and other Biden administration officials overstated the number of jobs that would be created by Biden&#39;s &#34;American Jobs Plan&#34; last Sunday and then asked, &#34;Why mislead people?&#34;
&#34;You&#39;re right. I should have been more precise,&#34; Buttigieg said.
Buttigieg then attempted to spin the projected number of jobs created by saying that there would be over 2 million more jobs created with the &#34;infrastructure&#34; plan than if there wasn&#39;t a plan.

Wallace said there was a huge difference between 2 million jobs created and 19 million jobs, prompting Buttigieg to say it&#39;s &#34;very important&#34; for Americans to know 2.7 million jobs will be created. He then asked Buttigieg whether he agrees that he and other Biden admistration officials exaggerated the &#34;jobs impact.&#34;

During an appearance on NBC&#39;s &#34;Meet The Press&#34; last Sunday, Buttigieg claimed that Moody&#39;s estimated the Biden plan would create 19 million jobs. National Economic Council Director Brian Deese also pushed the talking point last week on &#34;Fox News Sunday.&#34;
On Sunday, Buttigieg claimed there were several analyses on the spending plan estimating millions of jobs created, but Wallace pointed out that Buttigieg was the one who cited an analysis from Moody&#39;s.

&#34;Secretary, you&#39;re the one who cited Moody&#39;s Analytics as 19 million, and it&#39;s actually 2.7 million, which is a bunch, but it&#39;s not what you said,&#34; Wallace said.
&#34;It&#39;s part of a scenario that Moody says will create 19 million jobs, but the bottom line is it&#39;s going to add jobs and this is a direct refutation of people who are saying otherwise,&#34; Buttigieg said. &#34;So yeah, you&#39;re right, I should be very precise. The difference in jobs that that particular analysis suggests is 2.7 million more. That is a great place to be.&#34;

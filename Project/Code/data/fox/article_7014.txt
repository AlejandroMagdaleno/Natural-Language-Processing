Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., argued pursuing the impeachment of President Trump after he leaves office will ruin the start of President-elect Joe Biden&#39;s presidency. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#39;s deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill fired back at Sen. 
Lindsey Graham
, R-S.C., after the Republican seemed to blame the Democratic leader for security failures during the Jan. 6 
riot
 at the Capitol building.
During an appearance on Fox News&#39; &#34;

,&#34; Graham asked, &#34;Where was Nancy Pelosi? It&#39;s her job to provide Capitol security.&#34;
Hammill was quick to respond.
CAPITOL &#39;ZIP TIES&#39; SUSPECT&#39;S MOTHER ARRESTED IN TENNESSEE, CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY
&#34;This disgraceful attempt to shift blame for the mob attack on the Capitol is absurd &amp; pathetic,&#34; Hammill tweeted Sunday morning. &#34;He need only look in the mirror if he wants to start pointing a finger.&#34;
Hammill accused Graham of challenging the results of the election, just as President Trump did when he called for followers to protest outside the Capitol as lawmakers counted and debated objections to electoral votes.
&#34;He has repeatedly cast doubts on results of a fair election &amp; dangerously fanned flames of rightwing quackery,&#34; Hammill added.

The electoral vote counting process was interrupted by the riot at the Capitol, but ultimately resumed and concluded later. When the Senate resumed its activity, Graham forcefully rejected the objections to votes that were raised by Republican colleagues Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri.
&#34;Count me out, enough is enough,&#34; he said.

&#39;The Nomiki Show&#39; host Nomiki Konst debates Will Cain over rooting out systemic racism on &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39; 
The Black Lives Matter 
Rhode Island
 chapter is demanding 
Democratic
 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse cut all ties with an exclusive Newport beach club or resign.
&#34;This is an issue that’s not going to go away, and 
Senator
 Whitehouse needs to address it. He needs to take it on,&#34; the group’s Mark Fisher 
told
 ABC6 on Wednesday. &#34;If he thinks we’re just going to forget about it, if he thinks that it’s going to get swept under the rug, it’s not.&#34;
SEN. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE DEFENDED BY FELLOW DEM AMID SCRUTINY OF MEMBERSHIP IN ALLEGEDLY ALL-WHITE BEACH CLUB
Whitehouse came under fire in June after he accepted a local reporter’s premise that the Bailey’s Beach Club, of which his wife and family are members, had no minority members. He said at the time that all-White clubs are &#34;a long tradition in Rhode Island&#34; and that he was &#34;sorry&#34; things hadn&#39;t yet changed.
Bailey&#39;s Beach has since fought back against the claim that it is all-White, stating on June 23 that its members include &#34;people of many racial, religious, and ethnic backgrounds.&#34;
Whitehouse later said that he was not a member of the club and that he would not attempt to persuade his wife and family to leave the club, saying they were &#34;on the right side of pushing for improvements.&#34; (The senator is still able to attend the club through his family&#39;s membership.)
He also apologized for &#34;failing to address&#34; the lack of diversity in a separate sailing club to which he does belong.
&#34;The recent attention to this issue has prompted me to assess all my affiliations and to consider whether any involve inequitable or exclusionary policies. While I am not a member of the beach club, I do own a boat and belong to a sailing club in Newport,&#34; he said June 23. &#34;While this club does not have exclusionary rules for membership, it does lack diversity.&#34;
Fisher of Black Lives Matter Rhode Island said the group is giving Whitehouse until next Friday to put out a statement announcing his family members have left Bailey&#39;s Beach Club. If he doesn&#39;t, Fisher said his group will start protesting.

&#34;We&#39;ll go to his club, we&#39;ll go to his office, we&#39;ll go to his home,&#34; he told ABC6, &#34;wherever we need to go.&#34;
Whitehouse’s office did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

Fox News correspondent David Spunt discusses the latest with the Durham investigation on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Hillary Clinton
 said Monday she &#34;will never be out of the game of politics,&#34; saying that while she doesn’t have plans to run for &#34;anything,&#34; she will be &#34;involved.&#34;
During an interview with ABC News’ &#34;Good Morning America&#34; Monday, the former 2016 
Democratic
 presidential nominee, former 
secretary of state
, former Democratic senator from New York and former first lady said she will remain in the political world, even without mounting a bid for public office.
HILLARY CLINTON ANNOUNCES NEW BOOK, CALLS IT HER ‘FIRST FORAY INTO FICTION’
&#34;I will never be out of the game of politics,&#34; Clinton said, adding, &#34;I’m not going to be running for anything,&#34; but said she feels &#34;our democracy is at stake.&#34;
Clinton cited 
insurrection
 at the Capitol on Jan. 6, &#34;disinformation&#34; on Facebook and more.
&#34;I really feel our democracy is at stake, and there’s many reasons for that,&#34; she said. &#34;Some of them we saw on the screen with the insurrection, some of them because of the revelations about Facebook that creates a world of disinformation instead of, you know, one that we can agree on what the facts are.&#34;
&#34;I really am worried about what’s happening at home and around the world,&#34; she said. &#34;So, I’m never going to get out of, you know, being involved, worried and hopefully, trying to help in some way.&#34;
Clinton’s comments come a day before her new book will be available to the public.
&#34;State of Terror,&#34; which will be published by Simon &amp; Schuster on Oct. 12, is authored by Clinton and co-authored by Louise Penny.
DURHAM TARGETS CLINTON CAMPAIGN LAW FIRM IN FRESH ROUNDS OF SUBPOENAS
The book is described as a political thriller, following the appointment of a woman as secretary of state, a new president, who is a &#34;political enemy&#34; of hers, and how a series of terrorist attacks prompt an &#34;international chess game&#34; involving countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and even &#34;the Russian mob.&#34;
Clinton, during the interview on GMA Monday, said she used her &#34;experience to inform the character&#34; but said she was &#34;really inspired&#34; by her friend Ellen Tauscher, a former member of Congress who became the undersecretary for arms control. Tauscher died in May of 2019.
&#34;My first foray into fiction!&#34; Clinton tweeted last week. &#34;It was a labor of love with my friend (and favorite mystery author) Louise Penny, and I can&#39;t wait for you to read it.&#34;

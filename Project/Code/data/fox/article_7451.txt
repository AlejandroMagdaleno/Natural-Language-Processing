At a House GOP press conference on Wednesday, Republicans displayed a milk carton with Harris&#39; picture on it with a slogan on &#39;Missing at the Border.&#39;
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Republicans &#34;need more to do&#34; instead of spending time attacking Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 for avoiding the 
southern border. 
&#34;Republicans have been quite critical of the vice president,&#34; a reporter noted during the White House daily briefing. &#34;I’ve seen that, and they need more to do, I think,&#34; Psaki interjected. 
House Republicans at their press conference Wednesday brought out a milk carton adorned with the vice president’s face, and &#34;Missing at the border&#34; written below.

Biden said Harris, in the role, &#34;agreed to lead our diplomatic effort and work with those nations to accept the returnees, and enhance migration enforcement at their borders – at their borders.&#34;
Harris said that while her role in the border surge was addressing root causes with Northern Triangle countries, while Homeland Security Sec. Alejandro Mayorkas would focus on &#34;what is going on the border.&#34;

Still, Republicans have said Harris needs to see for herself what is going on at the border to know how to address it.
&#34;The confusion is perplexing to me,&#34; Psaki said, adding that Biden, as vice president for Obama, had filled a similar role as Harris, where he was the point person for the Northern Triangle. &#34;That’s obviously a role that’s focused on diplomacy, focused on working with these countries, with these leaders.&#34;

Texas Republican tells &#39;Hannity&#39; president ignoring Democrats&#39; traditional working-class base
Congressional Democrats&#39; push to convicted former President 
Donald Trump
 of i
mpeachable
 offenses is &#34;driven by the partisan rage and the partisan anger that the Democrats feel,&#34; Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told &#34;
Hannity
&#34; Tuesday. 
&#34;They hate Donald J. Trump and they are engaging in an act that I think is petty retribution and that is vindictive and a waste of time,&#34; Cruz told host Sean Hannity, adding, &#34;and so I think it’s time to move on.&#34;
Cruz told &#34;Hannity&#34; he heard the 46th president call for unity in his inaugural address, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., must not have gotten the message.
&#34;Unfortunately, congressional Democrats weren&#39;t listening to a word he said,&#34; Cruz said of Biden. &#34;And the very first step that they took is to charge down the road of a partisan and divisive and angry impeachment trial.&#34;
Turning to the impeachment itself, Cruz argued the House&#39;s action &#34;doesn&#39;t meet the constitutional standard.
&#34;They didn&#39;t pretend to follow due process, they didn&#39;t have hearings, they didn&#39;t pretend to look at any facts or any evidence,&#34; he said. &#34;This was an exercise in political rage. It was their id speaking ... look, these are the same Democrats who four years ago, in 2017 -- actually in December of 2016, before Trump was sworn in, said they wanted to impeach him. They&#39;ve wanted to impeach him from the beginning. They did it a year ago. 
&#34;I feel like I&#39;m kind of trapped in &#39;Groundhog Day&#39; where, apparently, every January, we&#39;re gonna be doing another impeachment.&#34;

Turning to Biden&#39;s decision last week to cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline, Cruz described the modern Democratic party as &#34;the party of Hollywood celebrities and big technology billionaires and the incredibly wealthy coastal elites. 
&#34;But if you are a working person, if you&#39;re a union member, if you&#39;re blue collar, if you have callouses on your hands, if you are a cop or a firefighter ... this Democratic Party doesn’t care about you,&#34; he added.

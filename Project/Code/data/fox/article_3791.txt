A small flotilla of boats returned to 
Miami
 on Saturday evening after motoring off 
Cuba’s
 coast and setting off fireworks and flares in a show of support for the Cuban people and democracy. 
The boaters had left Miami on Friday morning. 
&#34;We also want to draw the attention to the United States government that they have to do something,&#34; organizer Jose Portieles told The Associated Press. &#34;We feel identified with what is happening in the protests in Cuba. We could be the ones who are there.&#34;

Cuba considered the boats a provocation. Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister Bruno Rodriguez called the flotilla illegal and urged the U.S. government to halt them &#34;to avoid incidents which are not in anyone’s best interest.&#34;
The U.S. 
Coast Guard
 warned the boaters it would be illegal for them to depart U.S. waters with the intention of entering Cuban territorial waters. However, for those intending only to go near Cuban waters, the agency merely advised against doing so. 
The boats reportedly stayed in international waters.

&#34;We have to gain experience from the disturbances,&#34; he said in an address earlier this month. &#34;We also have to carry out a critical analysis of our problems in order to act and overcome, and avoid their repetition.&#34;

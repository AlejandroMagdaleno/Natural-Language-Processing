Former president reacts to golf legend&#39;s car accident on &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39;
Former President 
Donald Trump
 told Fox News Tuesday that he has &#34;no doubt&#34; 
Tiger Woods
 will make a strong comeback after suffering 
serious injuries
 in a car accident in Southern California.
&#34;He has overcome a lot, but he has had an incredible life and he is going to continue to have an incredible life,&#34; Trump told &#34;
Fox News Primetime
&#34; host Katie Pavlich. &#34;He will recover from this ... he will figure out a way.&#34;
Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Woods following his victory at the Masters Tournament in 2019. In remarks prior to the presentation, Trump hailed Woods as &#34;a global symbol of American excellence, devotion, and drive.&#34;
Woods was the sole occupant in the crash near the Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Officials said the crash occurred at around 7:12 a.m. and the vehicle sustained &#34;major damage.&#34; Woods was transported to Harbor UCLA Hospital, with 
multiple injuries
 to both his legs.
TRUMP REACTS TO TIGER WOODS CRASH
Woods underwent a fifth back surgery on Dec. 23, his first since a procedure to fuse his lower spine back in April 2017. Trump described the timing of the accident is just &#34;tragic.&#34;
&#34;He won the Masters with a bad back which tells you the level of talent is incredible,&#34; he said. &#34;And he has been working on that, and then has this happened, it&#39;s just tragic, tragic.&#34;
The former president said he and Woods have known each other for a long time and that the athlete was &#34;always great to me and I&#39;ve always felt the same with him -- I&#39;ve always just liked him. We had a good chemistry and always have.&#34;
Woods has reportedly spent hours on the golf course with Trump, an avid golfer himself who has owned multiple courses.

&#34;He will be back. I have no doubt about it. He will be back. He knows how to do it and I have no doubt,&#34; Trump said.
Asked to impart a final message to the athlete, Trump told Pavlich, &#34;All I say is get better and get out there, because we all miss him. We need Tiger.&#34;

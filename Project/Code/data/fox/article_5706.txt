WYOMING REPUBLICANS BLAST CHENEY OVER TRUMP IMPEACHMENT VOTE
&#34;I expect Never Trumpers to do this stuff. But Cheney should be run out of town, and back to Virginia for joining the blame game!&#34; Bouchard wrote on 
Facebook
 in January after Cheney&#39;s impeachment vote.

      Cheney and Bouchard.
      
Cheney has represented Wyoming&#39;s At-Large Congressional District since 2017. 
The Wyoming GOP 
condemned
 Cheney earlier in January for voting with nine other House 
Republicans
 to impeach Trump on charges of &#34;incitement of an insurrection.&#34;
&#34;By announcing her decision to vote for impeachment Representative Cheney denied President Trump due process; she judged the &#39;evidence&#39; before it was presented and refused to listen to the arguments made,&#34; the Wyoming GOP said in a 
statement
 last week.
An 
online petition
 to recall Cheney on Change.org has more than 35,000 signatures.

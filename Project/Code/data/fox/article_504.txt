 Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms signed an executive order Tuesday directing the city’s chief equity officer to find ways to &#34;mitigate&#34; the effect of the new Georgia election law. 
&#34;This Administrative Order is designed to do what those in the majority of the state legislature did not - expand access to our right to vote,&#34; Bottoms said in a statement.

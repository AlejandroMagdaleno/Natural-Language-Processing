President 
Joe Biden
 on Monday night said that he&#39;s unwilling to settle on an insufficient coronavirus aid package.
He made his remarks to Republican senators during a lengthy two-hour meeting. They recently pitched a slimmed down $618 billion proposal, which was far less than the $1.9 trillion he was seeking.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that despite some areas of agreement, &#34;the president also reiterated his view that Congress must respond boldly and urgently, and noted many areas which the Republican senators’ proposal does not address,&#34; according to the Associated Press.

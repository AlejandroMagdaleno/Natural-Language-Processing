Police said the other driver completed standardized field sobriety tests, according to the 8 News Now report. There was no indication that Sisolak had the same test, the report said. Neither showed signs of impairment, police said.
Sisolak’s office in a statement Sunday night said the governor and another driver suffered minor injuries and were taken to a hospital as a precaution. The governor was released from the hospital in less than two hours, his office said.

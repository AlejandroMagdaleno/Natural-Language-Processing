House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy points to &#39;the largest missed jobs report&#39; in more than two decades, the &#39;destruction of our energy&#39; and the migrant surge at the southern border as reasons for why he believes the Democrats are hurting America.
House Minority Leader 
Kevin McCarthy
, R-Calif., argued on Sunday that in order to &#34;defeat&#34; House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 and the 
socialist
 agenda, 
Republicans
 &#34;need to be united.&#34;
McCarthy made the comment during an exclusive interview with &#34;
Sunday Morning Futures
&#34; days before House Republicans 
will vote to potentially strip Rep. Liz Cheney
, Wyo., of her No. 3 GOP leadership position, which McCarthy called &#34;one of the most critical jobs.&#34;
Cheney, who is the most high profile of the 10 House Republicans to 
vote in January to impeach 
then-
President Trump
 for inciting the 
deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol
 by right-wing extremists, also faces a 
major headache
 back home in Wyoming, as Republicans are plotting to oust her as the state’s lone representative in Congress when she’s up for re-election next year.
McCarthy stressed the importance of being united given 
Democrats
 are &#34;destroying&#34; the country. He pointed to &#34;the largest missed jobs report&#34; in more than two decades, the &#34;destruction of our 
energy
&#34; and the 
migrant surge
 at the southern border as reasons why he believes Democrats are hurting America.
The unemployment rate 
unexpectedly rose
 to 6.1% — while it&#39;s still well below the April 2020 peak of 14.7%, it&#39;s about twice the pre-crisis level, the Labor Department revealed in its monthly payroll report released Friday.

Economists surveyed by Refinitiv expected the report to show that unemployment fell to 5.8% and the economy added 978,000 jobs. The report revealed employers added a measly 266,000 new jobs in April.
President Biden
 has scrapped a number of 
former President Trump’s
 immigration policies, which included construction of the border wall and having asylum seekers remain in Mexico instead of staying in the U.S. while they wait for their cases to be heard. The moves have led to a record surge in migrants, including unaccompanied minors, which had recently strained capacity at immigration facilities.
Also, in a series of orders aimed at combating 
climate change
, President Biden 
temporarily suspended 
the issuance of oil and gas permits on federal lands and waters and cancelled the 
Keystone XL oil pipeline project
.
President Biden revoked the permit for the 1,700-mile pipeline on his first day in office, ending a project that was expected to employ more than 
11,000
 Americans this year.
&#34;Everyone in leadership serves at the pleasure of the conference and there is a lot at stake,&#34; McCarthy said, answering whether he believes Republicans will vote this week to remove Cheney form her leadership position.  &#34;Democrats are destroying this nation.&#34;
He explained that &#34;we’ve watched the greatest expansion of government and the socialist liberal agenda&#34; and &#34;we watched them [Democrats] destroy our borders where hundreds of thousands are coming across not being tested for 
COVID
. We’re catching people on the 
terrorist watch list
.&#34;
McCarthy also said President Biden was creating &#34;
inflation
 that we’ve never seen before&#34; and that under his administration the U.S. has been experiencing &#34;a takeover of government&#34; and 
tax
 increases.
He stressed that the damage done will be irreversible and &#34;that’s why we need a conference that’s united [and] that’s why we need a conference chair that’s delivering the message day in and day out and uniting the nation to make sure that we are on the right footing going forward.&#34;
A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.
&#34;To defeat Nancy Pelosi and the socialist agenda we need to be united and that starts with leadership,&#34; McCarthy added. &#34;That’s why we will have a vote next week.&#34;
He went on to say that currently &#34;we are in one of our biggest battles ever for this nation and the direction whether this next century will be ours.&#34;

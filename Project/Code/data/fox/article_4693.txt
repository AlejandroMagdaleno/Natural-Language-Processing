Army Spc. Gabriel-Michael Flohl reflects on the heart-warming, emotional moment between him and his parents.
The 
House
 Committee on Oversight and Reform this week advanced legislation that would help the children of 
fallen soldiers and disabled veterans
 find employment opportunities.
Texas Republican Rep. Van Taylor sponsored the Gold Star Children Act, which provides federal job hiring preference to children of permanently disabled or deceased veterans who served during wars or military campaigns. 
Eligible children would receive a few additional points on the 100 point federal employment assessment scale.
These preferences have long been available to veterans, but the legislation extends them to Gold Star children in honor of the hardships they have endured.
CALIFORNIA GOV HOPEFUL KEVIN FAULCONER PROPOSES TAX PLAN TO MAKE VETERANS &#39;TAXED LESS AND HOUSED MORE&#39;
&#34;The Gold Star Children’s Act would honor the sacrifices of our fallen service members as well as permanently and totally disabled veterans by extending federal hiring preferences to their children,&#34; the committee’s chair Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. said on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. &#34;These children have suffered tremendously – the loss of a parent is a traumatic experience and something that will stay with them for the rest of their lives.&#34;
The bill has 14 cosponsors including both Democrats and Republicans.

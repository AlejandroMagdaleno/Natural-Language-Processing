Miya Ponsetto
 pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to 
hate crime
 charges after she allegedly attacked a black teen at a Manhattan hotel — as the judge warned the California native not to skip her next in-person court date in the Big Apple.
The 22-year-old was caught on video accusing Keyon Harrold Jr., 15 — the son of jazz trumpeter Keyon Harrold — of swiping her cell phone and then trying to tackle him in the lobby of the Arlo Soho Hotel on Dec. 26.
Ponsetto was indicted by a grand jury on charges of unlawful imprisonment as a hate crime, aggravated harassment, and endangering the welfare.

Ponsetto’s
 lawyer Paul D’Emilia entered a plea of &#34;not guilty&#34; on her behalf during a video arraignment in Manhattan Supreme Court Wednesday.
Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Sarah Marquez noted that the case isn’t eligible to set bail but asked that the judge continue the &#34;highest level of supervised release&#34; for 
Ponsetto
.
Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Laura Ward set 
Ponsetto’s
 next court date for Oct. 20, while warning that 
Ponsetto
 would likely have to appear in person in the future — a change from the coronavirus pandemic court procedures.
&#34;Although I did not set monetary bail, if you are not in court on dates that I or other judges tell you to be — even though you did not post bail — you would face bail jumping charges,&#34; Ward said.
Ward asked if Ponsetto understood prompting her to respond, &#34;Yes,&#34;
FLORIDA MAN ARRESTED AFTER POINTING GUNN AT BLACK FAMILY IN RACIALLY MOTIVATED ASSAULT: DEPUTIES
D’Emilia blasted the indictment as &#34;opportunistic&#34; for Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance following the arraignment.
&#34;Instead of helping to foster a civil and enlightened resolution to an unfortunate incident between two young people, DA Vance chose a craven and opportunistic path in indicting, with felony hate crime charges, 
Ms. Miya Ponsetto
,&#34; D’Emilia said in the statement.
&#34;The charges alleged are a brazen and clear overreach of the intent of the statute. In sum, they are absurd, and a perversion of our legal system.
&#34;As truly violent criminals maraud and run rampant through New York City, this DA exhibits zero interest in law enforcement and prosecution,&#34; D’Emilia continued.
&#34;Instead, he turns his prosecutorial fury on a distraught and panicked young woman stranded without her lifeline, her phone, thousands of miles from home.&#34;

The DA’s office declined to comment on D’Emilia’s damning allegations, saying it would &#34;rely on what was stated in court.&#34;
Ponsetto
 has also been sued by the Harrold family over the incident. That case is still pending.

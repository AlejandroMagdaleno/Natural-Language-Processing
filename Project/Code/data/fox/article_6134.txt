Judge Merrick Garland, President Biden&#39;s attorney general nominee, repeatedly avoided providing direct answers to questions from Republican senators during Monday&#39;s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
Garland dodged questions about the Durham investigation into the Trump-Russia probe origins, transgender athletes in high school sports and whether crossing the border illegally should be a criminal offense. 
Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, asked Garland whether he belives that illegally crossing the border should remain a crime.
&#34;I haven&#39;t thought about that question, I just haven&#39;t thought about that question&#34; Garland said. &#34;The president has made clear that we are a nation with borders, with national security, I don&#39;t know of a proposal to decriminalize but still make it unlawful to answer, I just haven&#39;t thought about it.&#34; 
Garland similarly 
declined to make a firm commital
 to leaving Special Counsel John Durham in place to continue his investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe. Garland said he has &#34;no reason&#34; to think that leaving Durham in place to continue his investigation was the wrong decision, but declined to commit to a course of action. 
GARLAND ANSWER ABOUT CUOMO INVESTIGATION &#39;NOT GOOD ENOUGH&#39;: REP. STEFANIK
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., pushed Garland to say whether or not Durham&#39;s investigation is legitimate, prompting the nominee to say: &#34;I don&#39;t know really anything about the investigation.&#34; 
&#34;I do think that somebody should look at what happened with respect to those FISAs and I believe the inspector general has done that,&#34; Garland added. 
Garland was also asked about allowing biologically male athletes who identify as transgender 
to compete
 in female athletic competitions. 
Sen. John Kennedy, R-LA, asked Garland if he agrees with the statement that &#34;Allowing biological males to compete in an all-female sport deprives women of the opportunity to participate fully and fairly in sports and is fundamentally unfair to female athletes.&#34;
Garland declined to directly answer Kennedy&#39;s question directly. &#34;This is a very difficult societal question that you&#39;re asking me here, I know what underlies it,&#34; Garland began his answer.
&#34;I know, but you&#39;re going to be attorney general,&#34; Kennedy shot back. 
&#34;Well, but I may not be the one who has to make policy decisions like that, not that I&#39;m adverse to it. Look, I think every human being should be treated with dignity and respect. And that&#39;s an overriding sense of my own character, but an overriding sense of what the law requires,&#34; Garland answered.

&#34;The particular question of how Title IX applies in schools is one that, in light of the Bostock case, which I know you&#39;re very familiar with, is something that I would have to look at when i have a chance to do that. I have not had the chance to consider these kind of issues in my career so far, but I agree that this is a difficult question,&#34; Garland answered. 
President Biden 
signed an executive order
 his first day in office that called on schools to allow transgender athletes to compete on girls sports teams.

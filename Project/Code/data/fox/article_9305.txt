&#34;This new platform is going to be big,&#34; Miller says
Former 
President Donald Trump
 will be back on social media in the near future with his own service, according to one of his senior advisers.
Trump was banned from 
Twitter
 following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. He had been a prolific poster on that platform before and during his presidency.

&#34;I do think that we’re going to see President Trump returning to social media in probably about two or three months here, with his own platform,&#34; Trump senior adviser Jason Miller told  Fox News&#39; &#34;
#MediaBuzz
&#34; on Sunday. &#34;And this is something that I think will be the hottest ticket in social media, it’s going to completely redefine the game, and everybody is going to be waiting and watching to see what exactly President Trump does.&#34;
Miller said he was unable to provide much more in terms of details at this point, but he did reveal that Trump has been having &#34;high-powered meetings&#34; at Mar-a-Lago with various teams regarding the venture, and that &#34;numerous companies&#34; have approached Trump.
&#34;This new platform is going to be big,&#34; Miller said, predicting that Trump will draw &#34;tens of millions of people.&#34;

In the meantime, Miller said that Trump will continue to endorse Republican candidates, teasing one that is expected to come on Monday.
&#34;Pay attention to Georgia tomorrow, on Monday. There&#39;s a big endorsement that&#39;s coming that&#39;s going to really shake things up in the political landscape in Georgia. It&#39;s big, it&#39;s coming tomorrow, and just be sure to tune in.&#34;

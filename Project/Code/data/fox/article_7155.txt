The Pentagon issues a military &#39;stand down&#39; to address extremism; Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane explains why the order is &#39;right on the mark.&#39;
The 
Pentagon
 is preparing to launch a program that will screen the social media posts of 
military members
 for &#34;concerning behaviors&#34; amid a broader crackdown on domestic extremism, according to a report on Tuesday.
Bishop Garrison, a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, is leading development of the program, 
the Intercept
 reported, citing internal documents. The program would &#34;continuously&#34; track social media content for extremist views.
The Pentagon is expected to tap a private firm to run the program to avoid potential First Amendment violations, the outlet reported, citing a senior Pentagon official.
The program will reportedly utilize keyword searches to identify potential extremist views. Officials are attempting to compile a list of keywords that would not violate freedom of speech protections.
Pentagon officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

Austin announced the establishment of a Countering Extremism Working Group, or CEWG, in April in a bid to crack down on extremism within the military. 
At the time, the Pentagon said the working group &#34;will make recommendations on further development of such capabilities and incorporating machine learning and natural language processing into social media screening platforms.&#34;

Earlier this year, Austin ordered a one-day &#34;stand down&#34; of military personnel to address extremism. The order came after Pentagon officials noted that some of the participants in the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol were either current service members or military veterans. 
&#34;We will not tolerate actions that go against the fundamental principles of the oath we share, including actions associated with extremist or dissident ideologies,&#34; a Defense Department memo said. &#34;Service members, DoD civilian employees, and all those who support our mission, deserve an environment free of discrimination, hate, and harassment.&#34;

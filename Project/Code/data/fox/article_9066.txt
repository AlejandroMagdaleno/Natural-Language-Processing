Former Brexit Party Leader Nigel Farage argues &#39;nobody can trust the Americans&#39; right now with military engagements.
A former top aide to President Jimmy Carter says the 
Biden
 
administration is &#34;reminiscent of reliving&#34; the tumultuous years in the former president’s administration.
Les Francis, who served as the White House deputy chief of staff during the Carter administration, said President Biden seems unable to &#34;catch a break&#34; amid the chaotic, crisis-ridden first year of his term.
Francis added that the current socio-political storm swirling around Biden reminds him of living through the craziness of the Carter administration.
&#34;The guy can’t catch a break,&#34; Francis told 
Politico
 
on Wednesday. &#34;It’s so reminiscent of reliving those times, where we had Mount St. Helens, we had Three Mile Island … we had the 
truckers rioting
 … Then we had the hostage crisis. We had the Soviets invade Afghanistan in December of 1979.&#34;
STATE DEPARTMENT OBSTRUCTION OF PRIVATE RESCUE FLIGHTS FROM AFGHANISTAN REVEALED IN LEAKED EMAIL
As Francis recollected, Carter saw a slew of crises in his single term as president, such as the cataclysmic 1980 
eruption
 
of Mount St. Helens in Washington state, the 1979 
Three-Mile Island nuclear disaster
, and the infamous 1980 
Iran hostage crisis
.
&#34;Now you’ve got a hurricane and a million people without power in Louisiana. You’ve got wildfires in the West. You’ve got the delta variant on COVID. Nobody could criticize him for those things, but they have a way of infecting the overall political environment,&#34; Francis added. &#34;What it does is, it sours people’s attitudes, and if you’re the guy in charge, people sort of take it out on you, their frustrations, their anger, whatever it is.&#34;
Amid the fall of Afghanistan and other crises, critics, politicians and pundits alike have been comparing Biden’s time as president to Carter&#39;s. Earlier this year, former President Trump 
mocked
 Biden as &#34;worse&#34; than Carter because he isn&#39;t just mishandling crises, but has &#34;created crisis after crisis.&#34;
Biden’s botched pullout after two decades of war saw the Taliban swiftly take over Afghanistan and Americans left stranded behind terrorist lines.
Additionally, amid the withdrawal, a suicide bombing rocked the Kabul airport, tragically 
killing
 13 U.S. service members – 11 Marines, one sailor and one soldier.

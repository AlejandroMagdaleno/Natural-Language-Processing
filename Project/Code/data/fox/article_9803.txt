The 
White House
 has offered President-elect 
Joe Biden
 use of Blair House for the night before the inauguration and he has accepted, a State Department spokesperson told Fox News.

LIVE UPDATES: BIDEN INAUGURATION JUST ONE WEEK AWAY 
Trump said last week he would not be attending Biden’s inauguration. He’ll be the fourth president to not attend his successor&#39;s Inauguration Day ceremony. Former presidents John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Johnson did not attend their successors&#39; inaugural ceremonies.
But last week the president, who failed in various legal challenges since Election Day – acknowledged for the first time that &#34;a new administration&#34; would be inaugurated Jan. 20.
BIDEN &#39;NOT AFRAID&#39; TO TAKE OATH OUTSIDE 
&#34;My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition,&#34; Trump said. &#34;This moment now calls for healing and reconciliation.&#34;
Biden’s inauguration is expected to take place on the steps of the Capitol, though this year with a much smaller audience. Members of Congress will each get to bring one guest, when typically 200,000 tickets are offered for lawmakers to raffle off to constituents. 
The theme of the inauguration is &#34;America United.&#34; 
Biden will take the oath in the same place rioters broke through security to breach the Capitol two weeks prior. Officials are ramping up security ahead of the event and Biden said he is &#34;not afraid&#34; to take the oath of office outside.

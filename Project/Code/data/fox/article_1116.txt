President Biden
 on Thursday announced a set of executive actions and legislative proposals on gun control, saying that gun violence is &#34;a public health crisis&#34; and the administration&#39;s actions do not contravene 
Second Amendment
 rights. 
The administration aims to &#34;confront not just the gun crisis but what is actually a public health crisis,&#34; Biden said in his remarks in the Rose Garden. He was joined by Vice President Harris.
&#34;Nothing I&#39;m about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment,&#34; Biden said. &#34;These are phony arguments suggesting that these are Second Amendment rights at stake from what we&#39;re talking about.&#34;
Continuing, Biden said: &#34;But no amendment to the Constitution is absolute ... From the very beginning, you couldn&#39;t own any weapon you wanted to own. From the very beginning the Second Amendment existed, certain people weren&#39;t allowed to have weapons. So the idea is just bizarre to suggest that some of the things we&#39;re recommending are contrary to the Constitution.&#34;
BIDEN TO TARGET &#39;GHOST GUNS,&#39; STABILIZING BRACES IN NEW GUN CONTROL ACTIONS
In attendance were several high-profile gun control activists, including Brady United president Kris Brown, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., and Fred Guttenberg. 
An administration official detailed the actions to reporters on Wednesday. Among them, Biden is asking the Justice Department (DOJ) to propose within a month a rule to stop &#34;ghost guns,&#34; which are &#34;kits&#34; people can buy legally to assemble a functioning firearm that does not have a serial number. 
Biden is also asking the DOJ to propose within 60 days a rule on braces used for handguns, which make them more accurate; to propose action on &#34;community violence intervention&#34;; to publish suggestions for &#34;red flag&#34; legislation; and is asking his administration to issue a report on gun trafficking. 
Biden also formally announced David Chipman as the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). 
A senior administration official Wednesday said that Chipman will respect the Second Amendment while he enforces gun laws.

&#34;I&#39;ve seen with my own two eyes what a bullet can do to the human body ... and I&#39;ve fought my entire career to fight this violence and to pass reasonable gun safety measures,&#34; Harris said as she introduced Biden. 
&#34;What are we waiting for? Cause we aren&#39;t waiting for a tragedy... We&#39;ve had more tragedy than we can bear,&#34; she said. &#34;The solutions exist... people on both sides of the aisle want action, real people ... so all that is left is the will and the courage to act.&#34;
The Biden administration is also expected to throw its weight behind gun control proposals in Congress. 
&#34;Enough prayers, time for some action,&#34; Biden said of Congress. &#34;I believe the Senate should immediately pass three House-passed bills to close loopholes that allow gun purchases, purchasers, to bypass the background checks.&#34;
BIDEN ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT: &#39;NO AMENDMENT IS ABSOLUTE&#39;
He also pushed for two gun control laws that would go even further than that. 
&#34;We should also ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country,&#34; Biden said. He said &#34;there&#39;s no reason&#34; a person would need a weapon that can hold &#34;100 rounds.&#34; 
&#34;We should also eliminate gun manufacturers from the immunity they receive from the Congress,&#34; Biden said, referring to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a law that prevents gunmakers from being sued for crimes committed with guns they sell legally. 
&#34;This is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued,&#34; he continued. &#34;If I get one thing on my list... give me that one because I tell you what there would be a come to the Lord moment these folks would have real quickly.&#34;

Some of Biden&#39;s claims during the press conference are regularly disputed by Republicans, including that gun manufacturers can&#39;t be sued and that background checks aren&#39;t required at gun shows. 
Indeed, the PLCAA only protects against suits for &#34;harm solely caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products or ammunition products.&#34; This does not count, for example, if a gun is defective or if a gun was knowingly given to a person who is banned from possessing one. 
BIDEN TO NOMINATE GUN CONTROL BACKER DAVID CHIPMAN TO HEAD ATF: WH OFFICIAL
Further, the &#34;gun show loophole,&#34; as it is known, is not actually about gun shows. All federally licensed commercial dealers, at gun shows or not, must conduct background checks. But federal law permits some non-commercial sellers who don&#39;t need to be licensed to sell guns without conducting background checks. These sales sometimes happen at gun shows.
Republicans, meanwhile, have expressed their suspicion of Biden&#39;s agenda which goes 
even further
 than what he announced Thursday. 
&#34;By appointing the anti-gun Merrick Garland as attorney general and nominating David Chipman — formerly a senior staffer at the leading gun control lobby —  to head ATF, Biden has made clear his sights are set on restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners while ignoring criminals and foregoing substantive measures that will actually keep Americans safe,&#34; the National Rifle Association (NRA) said in a statement.
&#34;Further, the proposals Biden announced tonight could require law-abiding citizens to surrender lawful property and enable states to expand gun confiscation orders. The NRA will fight this nomination and ill-conceived executive actions,&#34; the NRA also said. 
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., 
added
: &#34;President Biden plans to announce his attempts to trample over our constitutional 2A rights by executive fiat. He is soft on crime, but infringes on the rights of law-abiding citizens. I won’t stand for it. And neither will House Republicans. Follow the Constitution!&#34;

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said, &#34;The answer is not to restrict the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens, the answer is to go after violent criminals and come down on them like a ton of bricks.&#34;
Attorney General Merrick Garland also spoke at the event. He said that gun control is needed to prevent further &#34;tragedy&#34; from gun violence. 
&#34;We stand here today not at a moment of tragedy but in the midst of an enduring tragedy,&#34; Garland said.
Brady United, one of the highest-profile gun control groups in the U.S., billed Biden and Harris as &#34;the strongest gun safety ticket in history&#34; at an event last fall. 
&#34;President Biden’s actions are historic and they will have an immediate impact. These are tangible and powerful policies that will save lives,&#34; Brown said of the president&#39;s executive actions in a statement Wednesday.

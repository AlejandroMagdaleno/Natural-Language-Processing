Sen. 
Elizabeth Warren
 has not forgotten the many young people she befriended during her 2020 presidential run. 
The Massachusetts Democrat has a 
picture book
 out this fall called &#34;Pinkie Promises&#34; in honor of a favorite campaign ritual. When meeting a girl supporter, Warren would introduce herself by saying, &#34;My name is Elizabeth, and I&#39;m running for president because that&#39;s what girls do,&#34; then seal their bond with a pinky promise. 
&#34;The pinkie promises I&#39;ve made with thousands of girls will stay with me always,&#34; Warren said in a statement Wednesday. &#34;Those promises are a reminder of our strength, and I hope this book will encourage even the youngest readers to dream big — because that&#39;s what girls do.&#34;

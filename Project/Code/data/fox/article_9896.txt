Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell discusses Democratic funding bill that leaves out Hyde Amendment.
EXCLUSIVE: 
Sens. Roger Wicker, R-
Miss.
, and Joe Manchin, D-
W.Va.
, sent a bipartisan letter to the leaders of the Senate Appropriations Committee urging them to protect the 
Hyde 
Amendment
 and maintain this &#34;long-standing provision&#34; in the Fiscal Year 2022 bill.
The senators crossed the aisle in a 
letter
 
to both Senate Appropriations Committee chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and ranking member Richard Shelby, R-Ala., expressing their &#34;support for the Hyde Amendment.&#34;
Wicker and Manchin noted the amendment &#34;has been included in annual appropriations bills on a bipartisan basis since 1976&#34; and has been a &#34;decades-long, consensus-building compromise&#34; before calling for its inclusion in the budget.
BIDEN’S FLIP ON HYDE AMENDMENT SIGN OF ADMINISTRATION ‘SPIRALING WAY, WAY TO THE LEFT’: MCCONNELL
The Hyde Amendment is a long-standing Medicaid amendment that prohibits federal taxpayer dollars from going toward elective abortions except in cases of rape, incest or the mother’s life being in danger.
&#34;Recent public polls show almost 60% of Americans oppose or strongly oppose using taxpayer dollars to support abortion,&#34; the senators wrote. &#34;Both Democrat and Republican presidents have signed the Hyde Amendment into law.&#34;
&#34;It has passed through both Democrat and Republican-controlled Congresses, and it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1980,&#34; they continued. &#34;Repealing this provision would eliminate over 40 years of bipartisan precedent.&#34;
Leahy’s committee office did not responded to Fox News’ requests for comment.
In a Wednesday email to Fox News, Shelby signalled his support for the Hyde Amendment and agreed with the letter&#39;s authors that it is a bipartisan &#34;compromise.&#34;
&#34;I support the Hyde Amendment. Like the letter states, it is a compromise that both Democrat and Republican-led Congresses have supported,&#34; Shelby said. &#34;It was even upheld by the highest court in the land.&#34;
&#34;I agree that any effort to repeal the Hyde Amendment from our appropriations bills would undo 40 years of bipartisan precedent and impede our efforts to fund the government,&#34; he added.
President Biden recently flipped on his decades-long stance supporting the bipartisan amendment and congressional Democrats dropped the measure from the budget this year in an unprecedented move.

EXCLUSIVE: 
The Republican National Committee is suing two 
Vermont
 cities over new town charters that allow noncitizens to vote in municipal 
elections
.
&#34;Democrats are trying to dismantle the integrity of our elections,&#34; RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Monday. &#34;In addition to attacking widely supported safeguards like voter ID, Democrats also want foreign citizens to vote in American elections. Republicans are fighting back on this far-left assault against election integrity -- unlike radical Democrats, we believe that our elections should be decided solely by American citizens. This is a matter of principle and we will fight in all 50 states to ensure this remains the case.&#34; 
The case centers around the Vermont cities of Montpelier and Winooski, who in May had changes to their charters approved by the state&#39;s Senate that allowed noncitizens to vote in their municipal elections.
VERMONT LEGISLATURE OVERRIDES GOP GOVERNOR&#39;S VETO OF BILL ALLOWING NONCITIZEN VOTING IN TWO CITIES
&#34;I believe if someone wishes to be able to vote they should be a citizen,&#34; Vermont state Sen. Brian Collamore 
told Fox News
 in an interview at the time. &#34;The Montpelier bill allows what is defined as a legal resident of the United States to be able to vote in city elections. ... If someone is here on a permanent basis, why would he or she not want to participate in the process to become a citizen?&#34;
Republican Gov. Phil Scott vetoed the legislation in June, citing &#34;inconsistency in election policy&#34; across the state.
&#34;Allowing a highly variable town-by-town approach to municipal voting creates inconsistency in election policy, as well as separate and unequal classes of residents potentially eligible to vote on local issues,&#34; Scott 
said in a letter
 to legislators.
But the governor&#39;s veto was overridden by the Senate in a 20-10 vote, with Democrats getting just enough votes to clear the two-thirds majority needed for a veto override.

Now the RNC has promised to fight back, arguing the lawsuit is part of their &#34;ongoing fight to secure the integrity of our elections – in this specific instance, ensuring that American elections be solely decided by American citizens.
&#34;The suit also raises important concerns about how the laws will be implemented and whether non-citizens will end up on the same voter registration lists used for state-level and federal elections,&#34; the RNC said.

Melody Jimenez, founder of No Voice Unheard, discusses why she believes stronger policing can reduce crime in cities.
&#34;
Squad
&#34; member Rep. Ayanna Pressley&#39;s, D-
Mass
., campaign donated over a thousand dollars to a bail fund group that supports defunding and abolishing the police, according to the latest filing with the Federal Election Commission.
Pressley, who reiterated her support for defunding the police last month, made the &#34;
charitable donation
&#34; of $1,240 to National Bail Out, a bail group that supports defunding and abolishing police, from her campaign account last month.
&#34;We celebrate and honor Blackness always. And as Black folks continue to mobilize alongside comrades and co-conspirators to demand a defunding of police &amp; respect for the sanctity of our lives, we are still grieving and still mourning the loss of Black life,&#34; the group 
tweeted
 in June 2020. 
SQUAD REP. PRESSLEY SAYS SHE STILL SUPPORTS A &#39;RADICAL RE-IMAGINING&#39; OF POLICING AMID CRIME SURGE
The group tweeted again in August 2020 that they &#34;must dismantle, defund, and abolish the police to protect Black lives.&#34;
Last month, Pressley 
reiterated her support 
for defunding the police, saying she supports a &#34;radical re-imagining&#34; of law enforcement, despite the crime surge. 
Pressley tweeted her support for defunding the police last summer, saying the &#34;defund movement isn&#39;t new&#34; and added, &#34;Folks are just finally listening.&#34;
During a 
TIME 100 Talks discussion
 last June, she voiced her support for defunding the police, saying, &#34;This is simply about a refund.&#34;
AOC, &#39;SQUAD&#39; MEMBERS PROMOTE &#39;DEFUND THE POLICE&#39; BUT SPEND THOUSANDS ON PRIVATE SECURITY
&#34;This is simply about a refund. This is about true reparations. This is about investment in communities,&#34; Pressley said during the TIME interview. &#34;There’s a reason why the Congressional Black Caucus submits an alternative budget every year. Because we know that our communities have been historically under resourced, underinvested in and divested [from].&#34;
&#34;We know what works. We just haven’t funded it,&#34; Pressley added. &#34;And so this is the reckoning.&#34;
Pressley isn&#39;t the only member of the &#34;Squad&#34; of progressive Democrats who have supported defunding the police. Reps. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 of New York, 
Ilhan Omar
 of Minnesota, Cori Bush of Missouri, and 
Rashida Tlaib
 of Michigan all 
voiced support
 for measures that would reallocate money from police spending.

&#34;Defunding police means defunding police,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez 
said
 in a June 30 statement – about a month after George Floyd&#39;s death. &#34;It does not mean budget tricks or funny math. It does not mean moving school police officers from the NYPD budget to the Department of Education’s budget so the exact same police remain in schools.&#34;
Pressley&#39;s campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.

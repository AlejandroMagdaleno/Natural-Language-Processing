Former President Trump argues that if the filibuster was removed, which he called &#39;so radical liberal,&#39; court packing would take place and other &#39;very bad things that were unthinkable.&#39;
Former President 
Donald Trump
 argued on Monday that U.S. Sen. 
Joe Manchin
, D-W.Va., is &#34;doing right thing&#34; by saying &#34;no&#34; to ending the 
filibuster
. 
Trump told FOX Business’ &#34;
Varney &amp; Co.
&#34; that if the filibuster was removed, which he called &#34;so radical liberal,&#34; 
court packing
 would take place and other &#34;very bad things that were unthinkable.&#34;
In April, Manchin 
firmly planted
 his foot down, penning an op-ed on his decision not to vote in favor of weakening or removing the filibuster. 
&#34;I have said it before and will say it again to remove any shred of doubt: There is no circumstance in which I will vote to eliminate or weaken the filibuster,&#34; Manchin said in an article for the 
Washington Post.
 &#34;The time has come to end these political games, and to usher a new era of bipartisanship where we find common ground on the major policy debates facing our nation.&#34;
MANCHIN SAYS HE&#39;LL NEVER CHANGE MIND ON FILIBUSTER
Manchin said he could not justify to his constituents a valid reason to weaken the measure that currently requires the Senate have at least a 60-40 vote in order to pass a bill. 
Critics of the practice say it works as a policy clog, and in a 50-50 split Senate, it makes passing legislation in a partisan upper chamber problematic.
Left-wing Democrats in the House like Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 of New York and 
Rep. Pramila Jayapal
 of Washington have repeatedly called for filibuster reform or removal.
Trump stressed to host 
Stuart Varney
 said the filibuster is &#34;an important thing otherwise you are going to be packing the court [and] you are going to be doing all sorts of very, very bad things that were unthinkable and were never even brought up during the election.&#34; 
Trump argued that &#34;the most radical left people cannot believe what’s happening.&#34; 
The filibuster has seen changes since its implementation in the early 1900s with rules in the past requiring a senator to stand on the chamber’s floors and continuously talk in order to stall a vote on legislation they objected to. However, by the 1970s this was no longer required. Senators now are able to lodge their objection to a bill, triggering the 60-vote requirement to advance the bill.
The convenience of easier filibuster requirements has meant a drastic increase in bill stagnation. In 2019-2020 there were 298 votes held in an attempt to overcome a filibuster, a stark increase in the six such votes held in 1969-1970, 50 years prior, 
Reuters reported
. 
Manchin noted that both Democrats and Republicans have a duty to find compromise in addressing legislation.

&#34;Senate Democrats must avoid the temptation to abandon our Republican colleagues on important national issues. Republicans, however, have a responsibility to stop saying no, and participate in finding real compromise with Democrats,&#34; Manchin said.

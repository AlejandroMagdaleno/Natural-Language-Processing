FOX News contributor Jonathan Turley joins &#39;Fox Report&#39; to discuss the potential impact of possible domestic terrorism bill.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi
 has gone on record 
praising 
the storming of the Capitol as an &#34;impressive show of democracy in action&#34; -- the 2011 invasion of the Madison, Wis., state capitol, that is.
Pelosi&#39;s previous comment&#39;s resurfaced following the disturbing 
assault on the U.S. Capitol
 earlier this month at the hands of a right wing-mob who stormed the halls of Congress hoping to prevent the certification of the U.S. presidential election. 
The assault drew forceful condemnations from both sides of the political aisle -- including Pelosi -- who wasted little time introducing former President Trump&#39;s 
second impeachment
 in the House for &#34;inciting&#34; the violence.
GROWING NUMBER OF GOP SENATORS OPPOSE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT
Ten years earlier, unionists stormed the Wisconsin State Capitol in an attempt to block a vote on collective bargaining reform. Thousands of demonstrators managed to enter the building by violently breaking down doors and shattering windows -- but the attack garnered much praise from Pelosi and other prominent Democrats at the time. 
The occupiers were praised publically by Pelosi for their &#34;impressive show of democracy in action.&#34; The House Speaker took to Twitter to express her &#34;solidarity&#34; with the activists as they attacked the Capitol, and sent senators into hiding until police managed to remove them from the building.  
Fox News contributor Mark Thiessen highlighted Pelosi&#39;s previous remarks in a 
column 
for the Washington Post earlier this month, oberving that &#34;in other words, Democrats were for occupying capitols before they were against it.&#34;

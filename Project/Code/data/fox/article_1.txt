The massive $3.5 trillion spending bill being floated by 
Democrats
 in 
Congress
 contains tens of billions of dollars in spending that advances progressive ideology and liberal causes. 
In a lengthy Twitter thread, Grabien Media Founder Tom Elliot outlined several provisions in the spending bill including $15 million dollars to resource centers for people &#34;who are underserved due to their sexual orientation or gender identity.&#34;

In another 
provision
, over $20 billion dollars is directed to rent support for victims of &#34;stalking&#34; and &#34;dating violence.&#34;
The bill also contains $50 million meant to &#34;reduce human-wildlife conflicts on National Forest System land.&#34;
PELOSI DELAYS VOTE ON INFRASTRUCTURE BILL AS DEMS FAIL TO REACH DEAL: LIVE UPDATES
The so-called infrastructure bill has other items from the progressive wish list including free school lunches year-round for runaway and migrant children, doubling most federal cigarette taxes, and $2.25 billion for the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed &#34;Civilian Climate Corps.&#34;
&#34;FYI: The word ‘tax’ is used 1,829 times,&#34; Elliot added. &#34;The word ‘taxes’ is used 69 times. The word ‘taxation’ is used 7 times. Supposedly all of these new taxes add up to $3.5 trillion.&#34;
Democrats insist that the bill, which is currently being 
debated
 in the Senate, won’t cost the American taxpayers a cent because it will be &#34;paid for&#34; by ending tax loopholes for the rich. The cigarette tax would not merely tax higher-income Americans
&#34;The bill’s price tag is $0 because it will be paid for by ending failed, special tax giveaways for the richest taxpayers and big corporations, adding nothing to the debt,&#34; White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates 
told
 Axios last week.

On Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed with that claim.
&#34;It&#39;s not about a dollar amount,&#34; the California Democrat told reporters. &#34;The dollar amount, as the president said, is zero. This bill will be paid for.&#34;
Republicans have 
ripped
 Build Back Better, a $3.5 trillion reconciliation package, as a massive social policy bill that &#34;ultimately provides benefits to wealthy liberal elites at the expense of working-class families.&#34; Moderate Democrats, like Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., have also 
raised concerns
 about the reconciliation package.
A $1 trillion infrastructure bill that Pelosi wanted a vote on this week in the House is in jeopardy as bitter, intra-party clashes continue among Democrats over the sprawling, separate $3.5 trillion package. Left-wing Democrats have said they will sink the infrastructure package that already passed the U.S. Senate without the &#34;Build Back Better&#34; plan being brought to the floor simultaneously.
However, moderate Democratic Sens. Sinema and 
Manchin
 are standing in the way of the latter&#39;s passage in its present form over concerns about the price tag.

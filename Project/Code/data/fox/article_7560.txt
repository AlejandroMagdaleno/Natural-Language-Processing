Former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus on Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., confronting President Biden on the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Rep. 
Rashida Tlaib
, D-Mich., has been noticeably silent on her ally’s recent call to supporters to stop condemning 
anti-Semitism
.
Comedian and activist Amer Zahr is a political ally to Tlaib — who is a member of the progressive 
&#34;Squad&#34;
 and the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress — and even attended the congresswoman&#39;s swearing-in.
RASHIDA TLAIB HEADLINED FUNDRAISER HOSTED BY CONTROVERSIAL ACTIVIST ACCUSED OF ANTI-SEMITISM
 
Zahr, who is also a former campaign surrogate for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., 
posted a video
 over the weekend to his Twitter account calling for his supporters to &#34;stop condemning anti-Semitism.&#34;
Tlaib has been conspicuously silent since the posting of her donor and ally’s video both in the media and online. Tlaib&#39;s office did not respond to Fox News&#39; repeated requests for comment on Zahr’s remarks.
Zahr&#39;s video came as the U.S. sees a spike in anti-Semitic violence across the country, from 
New York
 
to 
Los Angeles
.
&#34;Stop it! Stop! You are not helping, alright? You are playing their games,&#34; Zahr said in the video calling on people to stop condemning anti-Semitism. &#34;It&#39;s a distraction. We’ve been condemning anti-Semitism for 20, 30, 40 years.&#34;
&#34;Stop it! They&#39;re playing games,&#34; Zahr claimed in the video. &#34;Don&#39;t condemn s--t.&#34;

When asked for comment by Fox News on Monday, Zahr said the people involved in the Palestinian movement &#34;have been condemning anti-Semitism and all forms of racism&#34; for decades.
&#34;We have been very clear at making this distinction between Zionism and Judaism – Zionism as a political movement and Judaism as a people and a religion, many of whom are a part of the Arab culture and have lived in Palestine for centuries,&#34; he told Fox News. &#34;And so we have condemned anti-Semitism for decades.&#34;
&#34;The question I ask when people keep asking us to condemn it is: What is it about us that makes you think that we wouldn’t?&#34; Zahr added.
Zahr declined to comment to Fox News on whether he believed his video calling on people to stop condemning anti-Semitism would result in further anti-Semitic violence in America as the country sees an upswing.

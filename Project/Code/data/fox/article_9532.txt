Evan McMullin, a former undercover 
CIA officer
 who grabbed national attention during his long-shot 2016 independent bid for president, on Tuesday launched a campaign for 
the Senate
 in his home state of 
Utah
, in an uphill challenge to oust conservative 
Sen. Mike Lee
 in the 2022 
midterm elections
.
&#34;Our politics are broken,&#34; McMullin emphasized a statement. &#34;And it&#39;s putting our country in danger. We need leaders who will unite rather than divide. Washington has left us so polarized that we’re failing to overcome major problems facing the nation and it has to change.&#34; 
McMullin won 21% of the vote in Utah in the 2016 presidential election, but captured less than half a percent support nationally. McMullin, a vocal critic of 
former President Trump
, is one of the leaders of a group of former and current Republicans who are trying to push back against Trump’s continued dominance of the GOP.
MCMULLIN ONE OF THE LEADERS OF AN ANTI-TRUMP GROUP OF FORMER AND CURRENT REPUBLICANS
&#34;The extremes in Washington don’t represent Utah. They prevent us from governing ourselves, and they jeopardize our democracy. The result is crisis after crisis that never gets solved.&#34; McMullin argued in campaign launch video. He stressed that he would run for the Senate not &#34;as a Republican or a Democrat, but as a patriot committed to defending our nation.&#34;
McMullin’s campaign video spotlights his decision to join the CIA and his work with the spy agency, including serving overseas hunting terrorists following the 9/11 attacks. He later worked as a investment banker at Goldman Sachs as well as an adviser to the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a House Republican Conference policy aide.

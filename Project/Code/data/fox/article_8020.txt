Authorities in 
San Diego
 have arrested a man suspected of 
opening fire
 as a crowd 
protested
 Monday evening outside Mayor Todd Gloria’s home, according to reports. 
Police said a crowd gathered outside the mayor&#39;s Mission Hills house around 8:20 p.m., when the suspect, identified as Lonnie Crawford, allegedly swerved his truck toward some of the protesters. 
&#34;He swerves, and basically tried to play chicken with us, and try to hit us,&#34; a witness, identified as Dan, told San Diego&#39;s KGTV-TV.

Crawford is also suspected of firing a gun outside the home, though no one was struck by gunfire, according to the station. Witnesses told police that Crawford parked the truck and entered a nearby apartment building – before coming out and firing at least one shot in the air.
&#34;This man is shouting ‘I’m going to shoot you in your face,’ repeatedly with a gun in his hand. And people couldn’t even get up to their cars because their car is past where he is,&#34; said activist Tasha Williamson, who organized the demonstration, which called for improving the rights of San Diego&#39;s homeless population.  
Williamson claimed that Crawford decided to open fire because he believed he had &#34;
that White privilege
,&#34; according to FOX 5 San Diego.

&#34;The man yesterday shot because he thought he had that White privilege,&#34; Williamson alleged. &#34;That he could go into his home, retrieve a gun for people who were peaceful, who were not armed, who had not damaged his property, his home. We’re not even trying to get to him.&#34;

&#34;All San Diegans have a constitutional right to peacefully assemble and protest without fear of being attacked or intimidated,&#34; Gloria said. &#34;Last night’s protest at the apartment building where my family and I live turned violent when a man not associated with the protest senselessly fired a gun. I am grateful for our police department’s quick work that apprehended the suspect who is now in custody and facing multiple felony charges.&#34;

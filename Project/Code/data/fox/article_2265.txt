Candace Owens
, conservative commentator and co-founder of BLEXIT, took to Twitter Saturday to condemn a bill under consideration in 
California’s legislature
 that would ban &#34;boy&#34; and &#34;girl&#34; signage in large retail stores.
&#34;California has proposed a bill to ban boys and girls sections in toy and clothing stores to create a &#39;safe space&#39; for children,&#34; Owens tweeted Saturday. &#34;They want to fine retailers 1,000$ for using the words ‘boy’ and ‘girl’ I cannot put into words how positively despicable Democrat politicians are.&#34;
CANDACE OWENS SAYS SHE&#39;S THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
Owens&#39; comments are in response to a 
bill
 introduced by California Assembly members Evan Low and Cristina Garcia earlier this month that would require retail stores with at least 500 employees to &#34;maintain undivided areas of its sales floor&#34; in an attempt to create a &#34;safe space&#34; for children.
Some retail stores have already phased out gender-based signage. In 2015, 
Target launched
 this practice after customers suggested that identifying products under gender preferences were unnecessary.
&#34;As much as I’d like to think of this as watershed legislation, this is something the industry is already doing. We’re just trying to play catch-up,&#34; Low told the 
Sacramento Bee
.
Low said he was also motivated to introduce the bill after the daughter of one of his staff members was frustrated by having to look for science toys in the &#34;boys aisle.&#34;
&#34;That was the impetus of this, which is how do we make a safe space today for children in society,&#34; he said.

He said the bill will become even more important as kids start returning to retail stores following the coronavirus pandemic, to ensure they can shop &#34;without stigma.&#34;
If passed, the bill would go into effect on Jan. 1, 2024 and would penalize retailers with a $1,000 fine if they refuse to de-gender their clothing and toy sections.

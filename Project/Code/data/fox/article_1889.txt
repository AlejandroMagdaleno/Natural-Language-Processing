FIRST ON FOX
 – Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, on Wednesday are set to introduce bicameral legislation that they say will counter U.S. adversaries at the United Nations.
The legislation
, titled the &#34;United Nations Transparency and Accountability Act,&#34; specifically calls out Russia and China, and says it would expose any member nations that fail to uphold the U.N. Charter. 
It would &#34;strengthen&#34; the United States’ role in the U.N. system by requiring the Department of State to promote the hiring of American citizens there, and in other international organizations.

The Kremlin has &#34;manipulated the United Nations procurement process to its own benefit,&#34; the legislation says, and China has &#34;used its leadership roles within the United Nations to block nongovernmental organizations critical of the PRC from being accredited to the U.N,&#34; while its diplomats have &#34;violated U.S. rules.&#34;
&#34;Authoritarian regimes, such as the Chinese Communist Party, cannot be allowed to continue their uncontested malign activity at the United Nations,&#34; Blackburn told Fox News., adding that the bill will &#34;strengthen America’s influence as a key U.N. member nation and expose the threat adversarial countries pose to international organizations.&#34; 
&#34;This work is critical to holding authoritarian regimes accountable for their relentless campaigns against democracy and human rights,&#34; Blackburn said. 
&#34;For far too long, the Chinese Communist Party and other malign actors have infiltrated the United Nations in pursuit of their own goals,&#34; McCaul told Fox News. &#34;Key reforms are necessary to increase transparency and ensure accountability in the U.N. system.&#34; 
He added: &#34;By having strong U.S. engagement and leadership, we can better counteract our adversaries who try to undermine the founding ideals of the United Nations and prevent us from solving international problems.&#34;

The bill would also direct the secretary of state to increase the number of U.S.-sponsored junior professional officer positions by 50%, and empower the president to name countries found to be conducting malign influence operations within the U.S. system as &#34;malign global actors.&#34;
As for contributions to the United Nations, amid &#34;repeated revelations of waste, fraud and abuse,&#34; the bill would require &#34;institutional transparency and accountability&#34; within the U.N.

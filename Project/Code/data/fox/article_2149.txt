John Sewell, Texas ranch owner, fears for his family&#39;s safety amid border crisis. 
Foster parents in 
California
 are being asked to hold as many as 26 unaccompanied migrant children in their homes amid the burgeoning border crisis, according to a new report. 
California&#39;s Community Care Licensing Office (CCLD) is approaching parents in the state’s foster care system and asking them to tell the agency how many extra beds they had to &#34;serve additional youth,&#34; according to a voicemail recording obtained by The 
Daily Mail
.
&#34;This is an emergency message, please respond to this urgent message from the Community Care Licensing Division,&#34; the voicemail said. &#34;CCLD would like to know how many available beds you have to serve additional youth.&#34;
The recording listed a phone number for foster parents to call back. A similar email was sent out to foster parents, with links to click corresponding with the number of beds available.

&#34;As many of you are already aware, CCLD has been sending automated emails and phone calls asking you about available beds to serve additional youth,&#34; the email read.
The email said that CCLD was &#34;trying to address the needs of a record number of unaccompanied children&#34; coming from Central America that are escaping &#34;impossible situations such as poverty, violence and natural disasters.&#34;
Travis and Sharla Kall, two foster parents in California caring for infant twins alongside their own biological, six-year-old twins, received the communications.
&#34;Usually the maximum amount of children you are allowed to foster at any one time is six,&#34; Travis told the Daily Mail. &#34;We called our caseworker and she told us that everyone was calling her because they had got that same call.&#34;
Travis added that the caseworker told them that &#34;there was a big influx of children coming in, but she didn’t know where from.&#34; The couple said their friends in the system had received the same message.

Sharla told the Daily Mail that at &#34;any given point in time, there are 30,000 plus children in the L.A. County foster care system alone.&#34;
&#34;So to ask us already certified foster parents to take on children from another country when we can barely take care of our own foster crisis doesn&#39;t seem beneficial to either side because either way someone loses a bed,&#34; she continued. 
The Kalls run a non-profit working to end human trafficking. Travis said that he considers CCLD asking foster families to take unaccompanied migrant children &#34;human trafficking&#34; and believes the ask is only the beginning.
&#34;It&#39;s not the burden of taking kids in because we have the heart for it,&#34; said Travis. &#34;But these are kids that were taken from the border for a money scheme and now they&#39;re going to use us resource parents to take care of them.&#34;
The revelation of the CCLD’s emergency communications comes as President Joe Biden continues to face down the crisis at the Southern border.

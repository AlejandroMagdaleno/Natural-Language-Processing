Fox News national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports to &#39;Your World&#39; the latest from the Pentagon.
Amid ongoing evacuation efforts in 
Afghanistan
, and shortly before an 
explosion
 left 13 U.S. service members dead and several wounded, Sergeant Major of the Army Michael Grinston highlighted diversity within the U.S. 
Army
 for Women’s Equality Day.
&#34;Diversity is a number - do you have people that don’t look or think like you in the room? Inclusion is listening and valuing those people,&#34; Grinston wrote in a tweet.
&#34;[Women&#39;s Equality Day] reminds us we’re smarter and more lethal when we come together as an inclusive, cohesive team,&#34; Grinston added. &#34;Our values demand it.&#34;
Grinston, according to his 
biography
 on the U.S. Army’s website, serves as the Army chief of staff&#39;s &#34;personal adviser on matters affecting the enlisted force,&#34; devoting &#34;the majority of his time traveling throughout the Army to observe training and interact with Soldiers and their Families.&#34;
The official Twitter account for the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command echoed Grinston&#39;s remarks, writing, &#34;Inclusion &amp; Diversity is what makes our [U.S. Army] better.&#34;
Grinston&#39;s tweet was met with immense criticism from several social media users who questioned his priorities as the Afghanistan evacuation crisis continues.

Americans,&#34; Jessie Jane Duff, a U.S. Marine veteran, wrote in a tweet. &#34;I&#39;m positive they didn&#39;t look or think like you, Sergeant Major. Every [flag-draped] coffin looks the same. We have an [Afghanistan crisis] and this is your tweet. Shameful.&#34;

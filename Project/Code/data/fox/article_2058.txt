Ted Williams, a former Washington D.C. detective, reacts to police resignations on &#39;The Story&#39;
A pro-law enforcement flag that was flying outside Brooklyn Center, 
Minnesota&#39;s
 police station has been removed amid concerns that it would inflame tensions in the wake of 
Daunte Wright&#39;s
 death.
At a press conference Tuesday, Mayor Mike Elliott confirmed that he had asked for the &#34;thin blue line&#34; flag&#39;s removal.

The pro-police flag has come under scrutiny amid widely-publicized police encounters with Black Americans.
Elliot said he had received &#34;a number of inquiries about the flag. I&#39;ve gotten inquiries from the ACLU of Minnesota, requests to have that flag taken down because they see it and the community sees it as inflammatory.&#34;

&#34;And so, with people coming to the department expressing their anger and seeing the flag -- we don&#39;t want the flag to be a flashpoint that angers people and does that in a way that they&#39;re going to come to the department,&#34; he said at a press conference Tuesday.
Sunday&#39;s fatal shooting provoked outrage and ultimately led to Police Chief Tim Gannon&#39;s resignation. Officer Kim Potter 
also resigned
 after police said she accidentally shot Wright instead of using a Taser.

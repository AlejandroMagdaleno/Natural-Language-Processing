President Biden
 warned new members of his 
administration
 Wednesday that he’ll fire them &#34;on the spot&#34; if they fail to treat others nicely.
&#34;If you’re ever working with me, and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you I will fire you on the spot,&#34; Biden told new aides during a swearing-in ceremony following his inauguration. &#34;On the spot.&#34;
He told the appointees that part of it is that he wants to root out systemic racism and that failing to maintain his standards of decorum would cost them their jobs.

&#34;My dad used to have an expression: He said everyone, every single person, regardless of their background, is entitled to be treated with dignity,&#34; Biden said. &#34;I expect you to do that for all the folks you deal with, all the folks we work for, the American people.&#34;
&#34;No ifs, ands or buts – everybody, everybody is entitled to be treated with decency and dignity,&#34; Biden concluded during his remarks Wednesday. &#34;That&#39;s been missing in a big way for the last four years.&#34;
The stern call for workplace pleasantness comes after a 2020 presidential campaign in which he said he’d &#34;beat the hell&#34; out of his opponent, former President Donald Trump, if they were in high school together.
&#34;If we were in high school, I’d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him,&#34; Biden said on the campaign trail in March 2018, taking issue with some of Trump’s past remarks.

The statement prompted a fiery rebuke from Trump and stood out as Biden tried to campaign on a platform of unity and normalcy – concepts he mentioned during his inaugural address Wednesday.
&#34;We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature,&#34; he said. &#34;For without unity there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward.&#34;

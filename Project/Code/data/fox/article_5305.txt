Fox &amp;amp; Friends hosts Ainsley Earhardt, Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade point out the hypocrisy of Vice President Harris who claims to take the border crisis &#39;seriously&#39; but still hasn&#39;t visited the border.
Vice President Kamala Harris
 on Friday called for &#34;immediate relief&#34; for Northern Triangle countries in a &#34;virtual&#34; meeting with the Mexican president -- part of her strategy to counter &#34;root causes&#34; of the migration crisis at the southern border.
&#34;It is in our countries mutual interest to provide immediate relief to the Northern Triangle and to address the root causes of migration,&#34; Harris told President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
HARRIS CLAIMS LACK OF &#39;CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE&#39; PART OF ROOT CAUSES OF MIGRANT CRISIS
Harris has been put in charge of handling diplomatic talks with Mexico and the countries making up the Northern Triangle -- Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- in order to solve the massive migrant wave that has crashed against the border in recent months.
Critics have attributed the surge to President Biden’s rapid rollback of a number of key Trump-era policies, including limiting the use of Title 42 and ending the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) while also 
narrowing interior enforcement
.
But the Biden administration has placed 
increased emphasis on &#34;root causes&#34;
 like violence, poverty and climate -- with Harris regularly listing a number of causes for why migrants have been increasingly making the dangerous trek north.
HARRIS SAYS SHE TAKES MIGRANT CRISIS ROLE &#39;VERY SERIOUSLY&#39; AHEAD OF GUATEMALA NEXT VISIT NEXT MONTH
Harris has 
called for significant investment
 in the region in everything from stemming violence against marginalized groups to assisting farmers to plant drought-resistant crops. She has touted an initial $310 million in aid being sent to the region, part of a broader $4 billion planned investment by the Biden administration.
In her discussion with the Mexican leader, Harris said it was &#34;in our mutual interest to address some of these root causes&#34; and said she wanted to do it in a way that &#34;internationalizes our approach.&#34; She has previously said she has 
spoken to leaders
 of Japan, Ireland and Finland about the crisis in the region.
&#34;And our approach is a comprehensive strategy approach. Our approach is to work with international institutions, to work with nations worldwide, the private sector and community organizations,&#34; she said.
KAMALA HARRIS HAS GONE 44 DAYS WITHOUT A NEWS CONFERENCE SINCE BEING TAPPED FOR BORDER CRISIS ROLE 
Lopez Obrador, meanwhile, emphasized a common approach: &#34;We have so many things in common and we are in agreement when it comes to the policies that you are undertaking when it comes to migration and we will help.&#34; 
&#34;That is what I can say as of now. You can count on us,&#34; he said.

Harris has been criticized by Republicans for not visiting the border in her role, 
with now more than 40 days
 without a border visit or a press conference. The White House has pushed back, saying she is involved in diplomacy, not the border per se.
But it will be even longer before her first in-person trip. While she has held a number of &#34;virtual meetings&#34; with Mexican and Guatemalan leaders, she will not visit both 
countries in-person
 until next month.

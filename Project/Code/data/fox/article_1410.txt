President Biden
 and 
Russian
 President 
Vladimir Putin
 concluded an hours-long summit in Geneva just after 11 a.m. ET, before Putin took questions at a press conference before Biden held a separate news event.
Senior White House officials said before the meeting that &#34;nothing is off the table for an American president,&#34; adding that the U.S. president reviewed issues, written materials and engaged with a wide variety of advisers ahead of the meeting. The meeting came after Biden participated in the 
G-7 and NATO summits
 with allies from around the world.
BIDEN CALLS PUTIN A ‘WORTHY ADVERSARY’ AHEAD OF GENEVA SUMMIT
Putin arrived in Geneva first, around 12:28 p.m. local time, which is 6:28 a.m. on the East Coast and 3:28 a.m. on the West Coast, accompanied by foreign ministers and a translator. Biden brought Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as well as a translator. Swiss President Guy Parmelin greeted the two leaders.
The three leaders participated in a photo op, with Biden and Putin shaking hands before the meeting.
At the start of the first meeting, Biden was asked by a reporter if he and Putin could trust each other, and whether he trusted the Russian president. Biden nodded affirmatively. White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said afterward that Biden was not nodding in reaction to any particular question.
&#34;It was a chaotic scrum with reporters shouting over each other,&#34; Bedingfield tweeted. &#34;He said just two days ago in his presser: &#39;verify, then trust.&#39;&#34;
Both Russian and U.S. ambassadors will be in Geneva during the high-stakes meeting, officials said, adding that returning ambassadors to their respective countries is on the table. 
After his press conference, Biden is expected to fly back to the U.S., concluding his first foreign trip as president.

Biden and Putin are expected to discuss a range of issues, including Iran and North Korea&#39;s nuclear capabilities, Syria, the Arctic, strategic stability, arms control, climate change and COVID-19.
The U.S. and Russia have long competed on a global scale, and while the U.S. exceeds Russian capabilities in many areas, as in the case of the U.S. military, Putin has relied on other factors to bolster Russian dominance — including cyberstrikes. 
When asked whether Biden planned to ask Putin about 
jailed 
Russian
 opposition figure Alexei Navalny, officials said: &#34;When the other side says something is off the table, nothing is off the table for an American president, especially human rights.&#34; 
Biden and Putin are also expected to again discuss the intent of the U.S. and Russia to pursue a &#34;strategic stability dialogue on a range of arms control and emerging security issues&#34; to build on the extension of the New START Treaty, according to the White House. The START Treaty places verifiable limits on all Russian deployed intercontinental-range nuclear weapons. 
The treaty was established on Feb. 5, 2011 and, according to the State Department, the U.S. and the Russian Federation have agreed to extend it through Feb. 4, 2026.
&#34;We are flexible on timing and format of agreements,&#34; an official said.

Biden is also expected to raise the issue of 
Russia
-based ransomware attacks. 
An official said ransomware will be &#34;a significant topic&#34; between the leaders, and maintained that Biden is &#34;willing to take action against Russia – significant types of action – like he did with SolarWinds.&#34; 
Biden has sought to pressure Russia though economic sanctions, imposing penalties last week on Russian companies and ships for their work on a natural gas pipeline in Europe, though the Biden administration spared the German company overseeing the project — leading to frustration from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. 
And last month, the Biden administration imposed a raft of new sanctions on Russia for its attempted interference in the 2020 election and a Kremlin-linked cyberattack that penetrated multiple federal agencies.

The measures sanctioned 32 entities and individuals who sought to influence the outcome of the November election last year under orders from the Russian government. The White House also expelled 10 Russian diplomats working in Washington, D.C., including some intelligence officers.
Biden, this week, said Putin was a &#34;worthy adversary,&#34; days after Putin praised former President Trump and called Biden a &#34;career man&#34; in an interview.
&#34;He&#39;s bright, he&#39;s tough, and I&#39;ve found that he is – as they said when I used to play ball – a worthy adversary,&#34; Biden said of Putin.
&#34;I believe that former U.S. president Mr. Trump is an extraordinary individual, talented individual, otherwise he would not have become U.S. president,&#34; Putin recently told NBC News in his 
first interview
 with a U.S. news network since 2018. &#34;He is a colorful individual. You may like him or not. And, but he didn&#39;t come from the U.S. establishment, he had not been part of big-time politics before, and some like it some don’t like it but that is a fact.&#34;
Putin added that Biden &#34;is radically different from Trump because President Biden is a career man. He has spent virtually his entire adulthood in politics.&#34;

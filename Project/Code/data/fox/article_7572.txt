FOX News contributor tells &#39;Hannity&#39; there&#39;s no evidence Donald Trump incited Capitol riot
Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., took former President Trump to task for refusing to testify at his 
second impeachment trial 
that many Republicans and Trump’s legal team have called a farce. 
Jason Miller, a senior adviser for Trump, told Fox News that his boss will &#34;not testify in an unconstitutional proceeding.&#34; Trump’s lawyers denounced the request as a &#34;public relations stunt.&#34;
PSAKI ACCUSED OF MAKING FUN OF THE SPACE FORCE, REFUSES TO APOLOGIZE
Raskin, the lead impeachment manager, issued a statement later Thursday and said any &#34;official accused of inciting armed violence against the government of the United States should welcome the chance to testify openly and honestly—that is, if the official had a defense.&#34;
The impeachment trial starts Feb. 9. Trump, the first president to be impeached twice, is charged with inciting an insurrection on Jan. 6, when a mob of his supporters broke into the Capitol to interrupt the electoral vote count. Five people died. 
RATCLIFFE DESIGNATES SPACE FORCE AS 18TH MEMBER OF INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY
Democrats have said a trial is necessary to provide a final measure of accountability for the attack.  Many Republicans accuse Democrats of using the riot for their own political gains.
Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told Fox News Thursday night that the impeachment is &#34;plainly unconstitutional.&#34; He said the Democrat push for Trump to testify &#34;contradicts&#34; what they&#39;ve been arguing for the past several weeks.

&#34;They didn&#39;t need to have documents that the evidence was manifest. It was in front of everyone&#39;s eyes on TV that we all saw it,&#34; he said. &#34;If that&#39;s the case, why are they asking Donald Trump himself to come testify in person?&#34;  
Cotton said that his opinion has been consistent from Day One. He said it’s &#34;beyond the constitutional authority of the Senate to have impeachment proceedings to convict and removed from office a man who has already left office.&#34;

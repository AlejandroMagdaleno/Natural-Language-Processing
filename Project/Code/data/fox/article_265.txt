New York City
 mayoral candidate 
Andrew Yang
 was hospitalized Friday after experiencing abdominal pains, his campaign said.
&#34;After experiencing abdominal pain this morning, Andrew Yang visited an emergency room where he was diagnosed with what appears to be a kidney stone,&#34; the Democratic candidate’s campaign announced Friday morning.
A couple of hours later, Yang said that he had been released, as he thanked the medical team at New York&#39;s Mt. Sinai West hospital, and thanked his wife for her support during the episode.
&#34;Thank you to the team at Mt Sinai West for the excellent care! And thanks Evelyn for keeping me company as I experienced my first (and hopefully last) kidney stone. Have been discharged and will now proceed to drink lots of water for the rest of the day,&#34; Yang tweeted.
The campaign said that Yang’s public evens for Friday have been canceled but that the candidate &#34;looks forward to getting back out on the trail in the days ahead.&#34;

The 46-year old New York City entrepreneur grabbed national attending during the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, as the one-time longest of long shots for the nomination saw his campaign briefly soar due, in part, to his push for each adult American to receive $1,000 a month as a part of a universal basic income.
Yang and his family were at Yankee Stadium on Thursday for opening day of the 2021 Major League Baseball season.
Yang was scheduled on Friday to unveil his Broadway and live performance revival plan.

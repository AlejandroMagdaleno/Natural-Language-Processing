Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer rips Biden&#39;s press conference, on &#39;The Story&#39;
President Biden
 raised some eyebrows when he quipped that he first became a senator 120 years ago in response to a question about the filibuster.
In the president’s first 
press conference
 after 64 days in office, Biden was asked about his stance on changing the filibuster.
The filibuster has been a hot topic among progressives in the Senate, who have deemed the tradition 
racist
.
Biden joked that he wanted to see the filibuster return to the way it was when he first became a senator – &#34;120 years ago.&#34;
BIDEN SAYS FILIBUSTER IS BEING ABUSED, THREATENS TO BACK CHANGES IF LEGISLATION STALLS
&#34;I believe we should go back to a position of a filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago,&#34; the president joked.
The joke turned some heads online, with Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., quoting the president&#39;s quip and saying Biden was almost right and blasted him for having &#34;nothing to show&#34; for his time in the Senate.
&#34;Almost Joe. 48 years and nothing to show for it,&#34; said Boebert.
Comedian Tim Young made his own quip, saying, &#34;Wait so you&#39;re telling me that Joe Biden WASN&#39;T in the Senate 120 years ago?&#34;
Former Congresswoman Nan Hayworth, R-N.Y., joked that &#34;it sure does feel&#34; like Biden was in the Senate for 120 years.
Regardless, Biden is the 
oldest president in U.S. history
, clocking in at 78 years old when first taking office in January.
Biden said Thursday he &#34;strongly support[s]&#34; reforming the silent filibuster to a &#34;talking&#34; filibuster, where senators who want to block legislation would have to hold the floor by talking endlessly.
He cited statistics that there were just 58 motions to break a filibuster from 1917 to 1971, but said just last year there were &#34;five times that many.&#34;
The filibuster continues to be a topic of discussion as Senate Democrats eye ending the centuries-old practice.

Biden said on Thursday that he 
agrees 
with his predecessor and former boss, President Barack Obama, that the filibuster was a &#34;Jim Crow relic.&#34;
&#34;This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle,&#34; Biden said of the voting restrictions some GOP states are attempting to impose.

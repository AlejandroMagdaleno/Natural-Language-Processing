HOUSE PASSES LANDMARK $1.9T COVID BILL, DELIVERS BIDEN FIRST LEGISLATIVE WIN
SEN. JOHN KENNEDY: &#34;I voted against it. President Biden says it&#39;s a coronavirus bill and my response is: really? Right, and the stripper really likes you. I said the other day that calling this a coronavirus bill is like calling Harvey Weinstein a feminist. It&#39;s just chock full of spending porn. And there were parts of it that I liked. I like trying to help people who are unemployed and I like trying to help our small business people, especially our restaurants.

But I don&#39;t understand why we have to give bucket loads of money to prisoners. Why do they need help? I don&#39;t understand why we have to give money to people who are in our country illegally. I don&#39;t understand why we have to give money to states whose revenues have gone up. I don&#39;t understand why we have to give $130 billion dollars to schools that refuse to open. I don&#39;t know why we have to pay reparations. This bill has a reparations provision. 
And if you add up all the coronavirus spending and then all the spending porn, there&#39;s no comparison. To me, using a coronavirus bill to effectuate spending porn is like looting after a natural disaster, and that&#39;s why I voted against it. 
We tried with President Biden. And he said, look, I&#39;ll meet you halfway. We said, OK, and then he just ignored us. I mean, if he was meeting us halfway, he has a damn poor judgment of distance.&#34;

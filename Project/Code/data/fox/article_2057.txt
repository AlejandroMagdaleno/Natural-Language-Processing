Brooklyn Center, 
Minnesota
, Mayor Mike Elliott has been bowing to pressure from &#34;political activists&#34; following Sunday’s police 
shooting death
 of Daunte Wright, a police group leader claimed Wednesday.
Brian Peters, executive director of the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, made the remarks during an interview on Minneapolis radio station WCCO-AM. Peters previously served as police commander in Brooklyn Center, the Twin Cities suburb where police said Wright, 20, was fatally shot by police Officer Kim Potter on Sunday.
&#34;If you watch that press conference, you can see the community activists ran that press conference,&#34; Peters said, referring to one of the mayor’s appearances before reporters this week.
BROOKLYN CENTER MAYOR DEFENDS MEDIA PRESENCE FOLLOWING DAUNTE WRIGHT SHOOTING, ONGOING RIOTS
&#34;If I were the mayor, I would not allow the political activists [to] run the show,&#34; he added.

Peters asserted that departed City Manager Curt Boganey, who was fired this week, and police Chief Tim Gannon, who resigned, were &#34;political pawns&#34; used by Elliott, whom Peters claimed was in &#34;way over his head&#34; in dealing with the fallout from the Wright shooting death.
Boganey had been criticized for saying Potter was entitled to &#34;due process,&#34; while Elliott called for Potter’s firing. Gannon drew criticism for claiming the shooting was accidental.
Elliott, an immigrant from Liberia, has been Brooklyn Center’s mayor since January 2019.

&#34;The decisions that this mayor is making is completely just nothing like I’ve ever seen,&#34; Peters said.
In the same interview, Peters said Wright’s non-compliance with police officers set off &#34;a chain of events&#34; that led to his death after a traffic stop Sunday.
Potter, a veteran officer who resigned Tuesday, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in connection with the death and was out on bond Wednesday night.
During the radio interview, Peters said non-compliance from the public was a growing concern for police officers as they perform their duties.
&#34;This is going to be an unpopular statement,&#34; Peters said, 
according to WCCO
. &#34;Daunte Wright, if he would have just complied – he was told he was under arrest, they were arresting him on a warrant for weapons – he set off a chain of events that unfortunately led to his death.
&#34;Daunte Wright ... set off a chain of events that unfortunately led to his death.&#34;
&#34;I’m not excusing it,&#34; Peters added, referring to Potter allegedly shooting Wright, which police have attributed to Potter mistaking her service weapon for a stun gun. &#34;But we’re seeing in policing these days is that non-compliance by the public.&#34;

Peters added that many police officers in Minnesota have built up trust over the years with the communities they serve – and periodic police shootings, while tragic, shouldn’t negate the hard work that many officers have done.
&#34;To cast a dark shadow over the majority of police officers in this state, I think, is unwarranted,&#34; Peters told WCCO.

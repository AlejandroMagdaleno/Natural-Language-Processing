Sheriff Hank Partin says the Virginia Democrat has supported &#39;Defund the Police&#39; in the past and that police don&#39;t need someone &#39;working against us&#39; in office.
Democrat Terry McAuliffe
 and 
Republican Glenn Youngkin
 are set to square off in Virginia&#39;s first gubernatorial debate of the general election season, in a race that is being closely watched as a possible indicator of voter sentiment heading into the 2022 national midterm elections.
The two candidates are set to meet Thursday night at the Appalachian School of Law in Grundy, a tiny town in conservative southwest Virginia. It&#39;s the first of two gubernatorial debates to be held before the Nov. 2 election. The second debate is planned for Sept. 28 at a community college in liberal-leaning northern Virginia.

Thursday&#39;s hourlong debate will be moderated by Susan Page, the Washington bureau chief of USA Today. Page will be joined by panelists Bob Holsworth, a well-known Virginia political analyst, and Candace Burns, an anchor for CBS 6 News in Richmond.
McAuliffe served as Virginia&#39;s governor from 2014 to 2018. Youngkin, the former co-chief executive of The Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, is a political newcomer. In Virginia, governors are not allowed to serve consecutive terms.

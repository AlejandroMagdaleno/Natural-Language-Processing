Fox News political reporter Brooke Singman discusses the former president&#39;s criticism of current foreign relations.
EXCLUSIVE: 
Former President 
Donald Trump
 slammed the Biden administration for leaving behind U.S. military equipment in 
Afghanistan
, warning that the Taliban will use U.S. military night-vision goggles to enable &#34;night fighting,&#34; and saying the group will ship the &#34;most sophisticated&#34; resources to China and other adversaries to be &#34;re-engineered.&#34; 
In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, the former president slammed the Biden administration’s military withdrawal from Afghanistan last month, calling it the &#34;greatest embarrassment in the history of our country.&#34; 
TRUMP SLAMS &#39;RUSHED&#39; AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL, BLAMES &#39;INCOMPETENT&#39; BIDEN
&#34;We look like we surrendered. We look like we ran,&#34; Trump said. 
&#34;We had F-35 fighter jets – the greatest in the world – and they had knives,&#34; he added. 
U.S. troops destroyed or disabled nearly 100 combat vehicles and dozens of aircraft before leaving Kabul in August, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, but the Taliban inherited a number of U.S.-supplied assault weapons, night-vision goggles, and other U.S. military technology. 
&#34;They didn’t disable any equipment,&#34; Trump said of the Biden administration. &#34;The equipment is perfect – and if it is not absolutely perfect, it will be fixed, very, very quickly, probably by China or Russia.&#34; 
Trump went on to tout U.S. military capabilities and equipment as &#34;the best in the world,&#34; and warned that the Taliban, using U.S. military night-vision goggles can &#34;do night fighting.&#34; 
&#34;The goggles are the best in the world, they now have thousands of goggles,&#34; Trump said. &#34;They are going to do night fighting, which they would have never done before. They never have done that before.&#34; 
The former president went on to say that under his administration, he &#34;rebuilt the military with brand new, beautiful equipment.&#34; 
&#34;They gave a lot of it to the Taliban, and the Taliban doesn’t need all of it, so they are sending a lot of the most sophisticated stuff to China and Iran and they’re sending it to Russia – to re-engineer,&#34; Trump said. 
Fox News interviewed the Trump administration’s deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, former U.S. Army Col. Heino Klinck, about the potential for adversaries to attempt re-engineering U.S. military tools – something, he warned, is &#34;highly probable.&#34; 
&#34;The Taliban is currying favor with the Chinese Communist Party because, right now, the Taliban finds itself internationally isolated,&#34; Klinck told Fox News. &#34;So they are hoping Beijing uses its influence to help the Taliban – particularly in financial and economic terms.&#34; 
Klinck added that he believes it is &#34;likely&#34; that China &#34;will be able to technically exploit our equipment left behind.&#34; 
&#34;I anticipate because the Taliban wants a relationship with Beijing, that they are going to view favorably any request from China to allow them to look at American equipment,&#34; Klinck said. 
Klinck said there is also the &#34;possibility&#34; that Russia and Iran would attempt to re-engineer U.S. equipment, but warned that China is &#34;the greatest threat in doing that.&#34;

&#34;It is not just about reverse engineering,&#34; he said. &#34;Oftentimes, that implies that whoever is doing that is going to want to reproduce the item. This is also about finding technical vulnerabilities to enhance their own indigenously produced systems.&#34; 
He added: &#34;Being able to technically exploit our night-vision devices would give China an opportunity to enhance their own.&#34; 
Klinck, while warning of the possibility of reverse engineering, told Fox News that while the U.S. military left behind equipment that will &#34;certainly cause some damage,&#34; he predicted it could have been worse. 
&#34;We didn’t leave the crown jewels in Afghanistan,&#34; he said.

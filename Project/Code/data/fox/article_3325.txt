Republican Florida governor fires back at White House press secretary on &#39;FOX News Primetime&#39;
Florida
 Republican 
Gov. Ron DeSantis
 pushed back Thursday against White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki&#39;s &#34;completely disingenuous&#34; 
implication 
that the state&#39;s 
COVID-19
 vaccine distribution effort is lagging.
Florida became the first state in the U.S. to vaccinate one million senior citizens, but Psaki was quick to dismiss the milestone, telling reporters in a press briefing on Tuesday that &#34;they’ve only distributed about 50% of the vaccines that they have been given.&#34;

DeSantis maintained in an appearance on &#34;Fox News Primetime&#34; that the state&#39;s vaccine supply is nearly depleted, telling host Maria Bartiromo that &#34;we can probably do two to three times what we are doing&#34; if the Biden administration provided them with an ample amount of doses.
&#34;I can tell you, all the first doses that come in, we can rip through them in a week and then some, no problem,&#34; he said. &#34;We can probably do two to three times what we are doing. All we were saying [is] once you have these things you&#39;re saying you&#39;re going to, [like] put federal resources, and create your own sites ... it’s really not necessary and I think a lot of  Democratic governors agree with me.&#34;
PSAKI WALKS BACK BIDEN COMMENTS ON COVID-19 VACCINE
&#34;Just give us more supply of the vaccine, because originally we were promised more up to this point,&#34; he added. &#34;I can get it in seniors&#39; arms if we get just get more in the shipments.&#34;
DeSantis said Psaki&#39;s comments were &#34;disingenuous,&#34; because the unused doses she referenced have already been earmarked for seniors awaiting their second shot.
&#34;What she said is they only administered 54%, but what she didn&#39;t say is the ones that haven&#39;t been administered are going to be administered on schedule because it&#39;s the second doses for people,&#34; he explained.

&#34;So the suggestion she was trying to make is that Florida should be giving away second doses to people who aren&#39;t coming in for their second dose. Our elderly population wants to get the second dose. You&#39;re going to see those second doses in Florida really spike because people are scheduled for it. 
&#34;But,&#34; he added, &#34;we are not going to squander those second doses.&#34;

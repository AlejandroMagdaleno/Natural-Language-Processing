Fox News chief congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on the killing of Ofc. William Evans, on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Several prominent Democrats are likely to face renewed questions over their ties to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan after the suspect in Friday&#39;s 
Capitol attack
, which left a police officer dead, was revealed to be a Nation of Islam adherent. 
The deceased suspect, Noah Green, included photos and videos of Nation of Islam rallies on his Facebook page and identified himself on the page as a &#34;Follower of Farrakhan.&#34; Green praised Farrakhan, an outspoken anti-Semite, as &#34;Jesus&#34; and former NOI leader Elijah Muhammad as &#34;the exalted Christ.&#34;

The most recent post on Green&#39;s Facebook page was a YouTube video of a 2009 Louis Farrakhan speech titled, &#34;The Crucifixion of Michael Jackson.&#34; In it, the Nation of Islam leader said Jesus was not the Messiah and called Christian theology a lie.
CAPITOL ATTACK SUSPECT IDENTIFIED AS NOAH GREEN, FOLLOWER OF NATION OF ISLAM
Farrakhan has previously 
described
 Adolf Hitler as a &#34;very great man&#34; and described Jewish people as &#34;termites.&#34; 
Several Democratic members of Congress have known ties to Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam. 
House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., shared a stage with Farrakhan in 2011. After the event, Clyburn 
told
 the Final Call, the Nation of Islam&#39;s media arm, that he was &#34;not bothered in the least bit&#34; by people criticizing his appearance with Farrakhan. Clyburn&#39;s office didn&#39;t immediately return Fox News&#39; request for comment. 
CORY BOOKER OPEN TO MEETING WITH FARRAKHAN
 
Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill, 
praised
 Farrakhan 
in 2018
 as &#34;an outstanding human being&#34; who &#34;does outstanding things.&#34; Davis also said he wasn&#39;t bothered by Farrakhan&#39;s position on 
&#34;the Jewish question,&#34;
 before later mildly distancing himself from the Nation of Islam leader. 
Davis didn&#39;t return a text message seeking comment on his ties to Farrakhan in light of Friday&#39;s attack. 
Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock has also 
spoken positively
 about Farrakhan&#39;s group. Warnock, in 2013, said the Nation of Islam&#39;s &#34;voice has been important for the development of Black theology.&#34; Warnock&#39;s office didn&#39;t immediately return a request for comment. 
Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif, has 
longstanding ties
 to Farrakhan and was seen on video hugging the Nation of Islam leader. 
Waters received a shoutout from Farrakhan at his 2002 Saviours&#39; Day speech, an annual convention held by the NOI. 
&#34;We have Maxine Waters here, our great congresswoman from this area,&#34; Farrakhan 
told the crowd
, which responded with applause.
Later in that speech, Farrakhan 
defended
 Palestinian suicide bombers, saying: &#34;The Palestinians have nothing to defend themselves with, so they’re so exhausted and exasperated, think about that, strapping bombs to themselves, making themselves a weapon.&#34; 
&#34;And then for the world to get upset because Iran or somebody is trying to send them some weapons. Wait a minute. If you were Jewish and you saw unarmed Jews being persecuted, wouldn&#39;t you come to your brothers&#39; aid? Do you expect Muslims to see their brothers suffering like that and not come to their aid?&#34; Farrakhan continued.

&#39;I heard shouting and pounding,&#39; Erin Hawley tells Sean Hannity
The wife of Sen. 
Josh Hawley
, R-Mo., has detailed a frightening 
protest
 that was staged outside the couple&#39;s 
Virginia 
home on the night of Jan. 4.
Erin Hawley, an attorney, told &#34;
Hannity
&#34; she was at home with her seven-week-old daughter when she heard &#34;angry voices&#34; outside. The senator and the couple&#39;s two sons were back in Missouri at the time.
&#34;I came up the stairs and saw about 20 protesters standing outside of our home,&#34; Hawley told host Sean Hannity. &#34;They were shouting with bull horns. I stepped outside with our baby in our arms and asked them to leave, saying that we had a new baby -- which was obvious -- as well as neighbors. They refused.&#34;
After Hawley returned inside, she said, &#34;three gentlemen&#34; pounded at her door and yelled into bull horns for her to &#34;come out, come out.&#34;
JOSH HAWLEY&#39;S WIFE FILES CRIMINAL COMPLAINT AFTER PROTEST OUTSIDE HER HOME
&#34; If my two boys would have been home, they would have been terrified and I thank God they were not, but it’s not a minor incident to frighten families or to terrorize children,&#34; Erin Hawley said.
&#34;The protesters know that. There are many public spaces in which they can get across their message. The First Amendment protects that, but it doesn’t protect coming to a family home at night.&#34;
&#34;It’s not a minor incident to frighten families or to terrorize children.&#34;
Hawley filed a criminal complaint against the organizer of a group called ShutdownDC, which was responsible for the protest opposing the senator&#39;s plans to challenge the Electoral College results.

Hawley said she has not yet been contacted by any of her husband&#39;s Democratic colleagues, but praised her neighbors, who she said belong to &#34;all sorts of political persuasions for their kindness and support.&#34;
&#34;There are good people in the world,&#34; she said, &#34;but no Democratic elected official called.&#34;

Colorado congressman reacts to Big Tech&#39;s influence on the 2020 presidential election
Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., has decided to stop accepting donations from Big Tech companies like 
Facebook
, 
Google
 and 
Amazon
.
Buck has been critical of Big Tech in recent months as the largest companies in the U.S. face regulatory scrutiny, accusing them of crushing marketplace competition, collaborating with China and &#34;silencing conservative voices&#34; in a 
July op-ed
 for Fox Business.
&#34;As the lead Republican on the antitrust subcommittee working to hold Big Tech accountable for their anti-competitive and monopolistic behavior, I cannot continue to accept campaign donations from Facebook, Google, or Amazon,&#34; Buck told Fox News in a statement.

He added that starting Thursday, he &#34;will no longer accept any money from these companies.&#34;

Buck received $2,500 from Google LLC NetPAC and $2,500 from Amazon PAC in 2020, according to Federal Election Commission filings, as Axios first reported. 
The congressman also applauded a decision from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, to turn down six-figure donations from both Facebook and Google, according to Axios.
&#34;Good to see fellow conservatives follow my lead,&#34; he 
tweeted

Buck is expected to introduced antitrust bills targeting the tech industry with House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee Chair Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., &#34;soon,&#34; according to Axios.

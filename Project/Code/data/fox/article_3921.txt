France
 recalled its ambassadors to the 
United States
 and 
Australia
 in response to a pact signed by the two countries along with the 
United Kingdom 
that the French referred to as a stab in the back. 
&#34;At the request of President Macron, I have decided to immediately recall our ambassadors to the United States and Australia to Paris for consultations,&#34; French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a statement Friday. 
MACRON HAILS DEATH OF ISIS TERRORIST WHO KILLED US TROOPS AS MAJOR WIN
France has 
expressed
 outrage after an announcement this week of a pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. that will provide nuclear submarines to Australia and scrap an 
agreement
 previously made to send French-made submarines to Australia.
&#34;The abandonment of the ocean-class submarine project that Australia and France had been working on since 2016 and the announcement of a new partnership with the United States aimed at studying the possibility of future cooperation on nuclear-powered submarines constitute unacceptable behavior among allies and partners; their consequences affect the very concept we have of our alliances, our partnerships, and the importance of the Indo-Pacific for Europe,&#34; the statement added.
FRANCE ISSUES ANGRY RESPONSE TO NUCLEAR SUBMARINE DEAL BETWEEN US, UK, AUSTRALIA
Earlier in the week, Le Drian 
told
 a French radio station that the pact, known as AUKUS and widely perceived as a challenge to China’s presence in the region, was a &#34;stab in the back&#34; and that France had been &#34;betrayed.&#34;
Le Drian also compared 
President Biden
 to former 
President Trump
.
&#34;This brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision reminds me a lot of what Mr. Trump used to do,&#34; Le Drian said. &#34;I am angry and bitter. This isn&#39;t done between allies.&#34;

White House press secretary Jen Psaki 
denied
 that the move had created a &#34;regional divide&#34; and said that France was notified of the deal prior to the announcement.  
A White House official told Fox News that the Biden administration &#34;regrets&#34; France&#39;s decision but &#34;will continue to be engaged in the coming days to resolve our differences.&#34;

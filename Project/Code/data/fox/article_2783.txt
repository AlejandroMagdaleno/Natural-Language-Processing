 Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 declined to reveal whether he’d resign if the state attorney general’s investigation found he had committed sexual harassment, saying Friday he would speak further on the matter after the review was complete. 
Cuomo repeated his comment that the public only has &#34;one side of the story&#34; right now. 
The governor was asked by a reporter at a virtual briefing whether he’d resign if the independent review led by Attorney General Letitia James showed he committed sexual harassment &#34;under the definition in the handbook.&#34;
&#34;Let the review proceed, then there will be a lot to talk about in the review,&#34; Cuomo replied. He said he looks forward to the review’s release. &#34;There has been one side of the story.&#34;

Cuomo had gotten a large advance on his memoir before it was published in October of last year. The book touted Cuomo’s COVID-19 response before it was discovered the state had vastly undercounted the coronavirus nursing home death tolls.

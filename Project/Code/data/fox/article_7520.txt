Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., discusses the Biden administration’s reopening of migrant facilities.
The Biden administration
 is showing &#34;hypocrisy&#34; by reopening a 
migrant facility
 that the Trump administration was criticized for using, Sen. 
Rand Paul,
 R-Ky., said on Thursday.
&#34;Do you think that the Democrats, who are crying those tears over the poor people they said Trump put in cages, do you think those might be tears of hypocrisy?&#34; Paul told &#34;
America Reports
.&#34;
Paul noted that the cages and detention facilities were built under the Obama administration.
&#34;They were used in the Trump administration. Now, they’re being reopened under the Biden administration,&#34; he said. &#34;Count me [as] one who thinks that there&#39;s a load of hypocrisy going on here.&#34;
PSAKI DEFENDS REOPENING OF MIGRANT FACILITY FOR CHILDREN UNDER BIDEN: ‘THIS IS NOT KIDS BEING KEPT IN CAGES’
White House
 press secretary 
Jen
 
Psaki
 on Tuesday described the use of the facility as a &#34;temporary reopening&#34; due to the COVID-19 pandemic and added that the administration’s &#34;intention is very much to close it, but we want to ensure that we can follow COVID protocols as unaccompanied minors come into the United States.&#34;
Paul added Thursday that he supports a &#34;strict policy of sending back the people who cross the U.S. border illegally.&#34;

&#34;If you&#39;re trying to break into the country, you stay in a camp on the other side of the border. You never set foot in here. And if you do, you&#39;re sent back,&#34; he said.
Paul continued by saying that he is &#34;also for more legal and lawful immigration. I want more people to come to our country. And I think immigrants are a great asset to our country. But I don&#39;t want illegal and unlawful immigration. So I think there&#39;s a lot of hypocrisy going around.&#34;

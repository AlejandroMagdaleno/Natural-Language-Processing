Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 came under fire Saturday for tweeting about Memorial Day, but without mentioning the significance of the weekend. 
&#34;Enjoy the long weekend,&#34; Harris wrote, above a candid photo of herself smiling.
Social media users condemned Harris’ lack of tact reminding the vice president of the sacrifices the &#34;long weekend&#34; is meant to honor.
&#34;Don&#39;t forget why we have a long weekend,&#34; Tony Lederer wrote in a tweet paired with a picture of the Vietnam Memorial. 
KAMALA HARRIS HAS GONE 66 DAYS WITHOUT A NEWS CONFERENCE SINCE BEING TAPPED FOR BORDER CRISIS ROLE
&#34;It is Memorial Day weekend - [not] for enjoying - but for memorializing our fallen,&#34; wrote another. &#34;Our brothers and sisters, who &#39;gave the last full measure of devotion. Please try to respect that.&#34;
The tweet was shared with an image of a woman lying on a blanket in front of a tombstone at the Arlington National Cemetery with an infant.
&#34;While we get the long weekend to ‘enjoy,’ let us all please take a solemn moment to remember those courageous men and women who sacrificed *everything,&#34; Peter Francis wrote. 
Memorial Day is celebrated the last Monday of May each year to honor the men and women who have died while serving in the U.S. military. 
The tradition began as Decoration Day during the spring in the years following the end of the Civil War, eventually becoming a federal holiday in 1971.
A 2019 study by 
Bloomberg BNA
 found that 97 percent of employees designated Memorial Day a paid day off, but roughly 40 percent of companies require some employees to still work. 
Other social media users reminded the vice president that not all Americans are allotted a long weekend with Mondays off, particularly as the service industry has reopened following the coronavirus pandemic.

Harris addressed the pandemic in a speech at a commencement ceremony for graduates at the U.S. Naval Academy Friday.
&#34;It has forever impacted our world,&#34; she said. &#34;It has forever influenced our perspective, and if we weren’t clear before, we know now: Our world is interconnected. Our world is interdependent, and our world is fragile.&#34;
&#34;This, midshipmen, is the era we are in, and it is unlike any era that came before,&#34; Harris added.
But Harris turned heads when she made a joke about Naval electrical engineers creating green energy during her speech Friday.
&#34;Just ask any 
Marine
 today, would she rather carry 20 pounds of batteries or a rolled-up solar panel, and I am positive she will tell you a solar panel, and so would he,&#34; she said, before laughing.
The White House declined to comment on the tweet that garnered negative attention.

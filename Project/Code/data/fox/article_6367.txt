Score this one a big error for House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
.
Thursday was the 90th birthday of 
MLB
 legend Willie Mays, who played most of his career for Pelosi’s hometown team, the 
San Francisco Giants
.
But Pelosi marked the occasion by posting a photo of herself with another famous Willie, former Giants star Willie McCovey, who died in 2018.

&#34;Happy 90th Birthday to an all-American icon, Willie Mays,&#34; Pelosi captioned the shot of herself and McCovey, who was a longtime teammate of Mays’ in the 1960s and 1970s and was also feared as a homerun hitter. (McCovey’s wife Estela was also in the photo.)
The speaker’s office, which blamed a staffer for the mistake, soon swapped in a photo of Pelosi with the correct Willie, using the same caption.

Gen. David Petraeus says it&#39;s still not clear if the &#39;endless war&#39; will actually end or continue as the Taliban try to govern the country. 
As the 20-year mark of 
September 11
 approaches, a Fox News Poll conducted before the recent events in 
Afghanistan
 finds that two-thirds (64%) of registered voters think the 2001 
terrorist
 attacks permanently changed the way we live in the 
United States
.
A quarter of respondents say the attacks caused temporary changes (24%), while 9% think life didn’t change at all.
The poll was conducted Aug. 7-Aug. 10, before the U.S. pullout in Afghanistan became front-page news.

Voters see the 9/11 attacks as more consequential than the 
coronavirus pandemic
, with half (50%) saying in a 
June Fox News poll
 that the pandemic has made permanent changes to life in the U.S.
A majority believe the policies implemented because of the attacks made America safer (65%). Seventeen percent say less safe and 13% feel the policies didn’t make a difference.
But were the measures taken in response to 9/11 an overreaction? Few feel that way about increased airport screening (15%) or establishing the 
Department of Homeland Security
 (18%).
FOX NEWS POLL: HIGH CONCERN ABOUT CRIME AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, TWO OF BIDEN&#39;S WEAK SPOTS
Nearly twice as many, though still a minority, say interrogation techniques like waterboarding (38%) and military action against 
Iraq
 (31%) were an overreaction.
In early August, one-quarter (25%) said the U.S. taking military action against Afghanistan after 9/11 was an overreaction, while half (49%) thought it was &#34;about right,&#34; down from 56% in 2011 at the 10-year mark.
&#34;These opinions could already be shifting as the Taliban has taken complete control of Afghanistan since the poll, which could make more Americans wonder why we went there in the first place,&#34; says Chris Anderson, a Democratic pollster who conducts the Fox News Poll with Republican Daron Shaw.
FOX NEWS POLL: HALF OF VOTERS ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH CRITICAL RACE THEORY
When voters were asked their level of concern on several issues, attacks from Islamic terrorists comes in last -- albeit this was before the events in Afghanistan. Fifty-eight percent are &#34;extremely&#34; or &#34;very&#34; concerned about attacks, while issues such as inflation (86%), political divisions (83%), violent crime (81%), health care (78%), China’s growing power (73%), unemployment (71%), the federal deficit (70%), coronavirus (69%), opioid addiction (69%), illegal immigration (66%), and racism (66%) are of greater concern. Climate change is at about the same level of concern (60%).

&#34;Although Americans remain concerned about possible attacks by Islamic terrorists, the percentage indicating they are anxious has declined over the years,&#34; says Shaw. &#34;It will be interesting to see if the loss of Afghanistan to the Taliban rekindles concerns among voters whose focus had shifted.&#34;

Sixteen 
Republican
 senators sent a letter to 
President Biden
 calling on the president to use all means necessary to rescue Americans and Afghan allies trapped in 
Afghanistan
.
Senator Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., led 15 of his colleagues in a letter to the president Thursday, calling on Biden to take charge as Americans and allies alike are stuck behind Taliban lines.
&#34;From the very beginning, when you announced the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, Members of Congress — along with your top military advisors — advised you that a complete, unconditional U.S. withdrawal would be catastrophic,&#34; they wrote.
AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL: BIDEN CONTINUES BUNKER STRATEGY AFTER WIDELY PANNED ABC INTERVIEW
&#34;Now, we have seen what we predicted come to pass,&#34; the senators 
wrote
. &#34;The situation in Afghanistan has gone from bad to worse in a matter of weeks, and we are facing the worst-case scenario — a total Taliban takeover in Afghanistan.&#34;
The senators expressed concerns that the Biden administration failed to establish at plan to evacuate all Americans and Afghan allies &#34;as quickly and safely as possible.&#34;
&#34;This must be our top priority,&#34; they wrote, also warning that America&#39;s Afghan allies &#34;will face a tragic and deadly fate&#34; if America doesn’t uphold its promise to Afghans who have helped the U.S.
&#34;We are particularly perturbed that your administration is failing to guarantee the safety of Americans and our Afghan partners still in the country,&#34; the senators wrote. &#34;Press reports indicate that while American citizens are being urged to make their way to Hamid Karzai International Airport, the United States Government cannot guarantee their security, and has offered no support or guidance other than wishing them luck.&#34;
&#34;We urge you to use whatever means necessary to provide safe and secure passageway through any Taliban barriers for all American citizens and all eligible Afghan partners to appropriate evacuation points and then move them via safe corridors to exit the country,&#34; the senators wrote, adding it would be &#34;unconscionable&#34; to leave any American citizen or Afghan partner behind.
&#34;You must devote all means necessary to ensure every American citizen and all eligible Afghan partners are successfully evacuated,&#34; they concluded. &#34;In addition, you must make it clear to the Taliban and every other terrorist group that they will face severe consequences if they attempt to interfere with this process.&#34;

South Dakota governor says a good leader knows &#39;the buck stops with them&#39; on &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39;
South Dakota
 Gov. 
Kristi Noem
 plans to keep fighting to proceed with Independence Day fireworks at Mount Rushmore after the Biden administration denied her request.
Noem will be doing &#34;everything in her ability to ensure&#34; America can celebrate its birthday with fireworks at the national monument, the governor&#39;s communications director, Ian Fury, told Fox News on Monday. 
Noem&#39;s office pointed at President Joe Biden&#39;s primetime 
speech
 last week, where he told Americans that &#34;there is a good chance you, your family and friends can get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout or a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day.&#34;
NOEM: MEDIA USED FEAR TO &#39;PUSH AN AGENDA&#39; DURING COVID PANDEMIC
&#34;After a long, hard year, that will make this Independence Day truly special - where we not only mark our independence as a nation but we begin to mark our independence from this virus,&#34; Biden said. 
&#34;The best place in America to hold such a special celebration would be Mount Rushmore, fireworks included,&#34; Fury argued.
&#34;Rest assured, there will be plenty more from Governor Noem on this topic in the very near future,&#34; he added. 
SOUTH DAKOTA REQUEST FOR JULY 4TH FIREWORKS AT MOUNT RUSHMORE DENIED BY NATIONAL PARKS SERVICE
On Friday, the National Park Service (NPS) sent a letter denying Noem’s request to have fireworks over Mount Rushmore.
NPS Regional Director Herbert Frost told the South Dakota tourism office that &#34;potential risks&#34; regarding people’s &#34;health and safety&#34; as well as &#34;to the park itself&#34; remain &#34;a concern&#34; and are &#34;still&#34; being looked at.

&#34;In addition, the park’s many tribal partners expressly oppose fireworks at the Memorial,&#34; Frost added in the letter.
Last year’s Independence Day celebration saw the first use of fireworks at Mount Rushmore since 2009 after being canceled due to wildfire concerns.

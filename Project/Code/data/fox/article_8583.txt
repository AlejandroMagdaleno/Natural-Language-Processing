Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the controversial nomination on &#39;The Story&#39;
The member companies of the American Loggers Council (ALC) has come out in unanimous opposition against 
President Biden’s
 embattled nominee to lead the 
Bureau of Land Management
 (BLM).
The ALC sent a memo to the Senate obtained by Fox News noting they &#34;do not generally weigh in on the nominees or the confirmation process&#34; but that 
Tracy Stone-Manning&#39;s
 nomination to lead the BLM was a different case.
In the memo, the companies call Stone-Manning’s ties to a 1989 Earth First! tree-spiking plot &#34;very disconcerting,&#34; noting that the 
eco-terrorism
 tactic of tree-spiking, itself, &#34;is designed to damage equipment and potentially injure / kill loggers and mill workers.&#34;
75 GOP LAWMAKERS OPPOSE BIDEN’S EMBATTLED NOMINEE TRACY STONE-MANNING
&#34;Those trees remain a hazard and threat to loggers today,&#34; the ALC wrote in their memo.
The ALC also cited the BLM’s role in overseeing federal forests, writing Stone-Manning’s &#34;history of involvement in activities designed [to] oppose and interfere with healthy forest management practices on public lands casts doubt on her qualifications to effectively administer the responsibilities of the position she has been nominated for.&#34;
&#34;As the result of the American Loggers Council Board of Directors unanimous vote, after a thorough review of the attached information and discussion, the American Loggers Council opposes her nomination as Director of the Bureau of Land Management,&#34; the group wrote.
&#34;Every senator needs to consider carefully if they want their name associated with Tracy Stone-Manning,&#34; Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee ranking member John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told Fox News in a Monday email.
&#34;All 10 Republicans on the Energy and Natural Resources committee have asked President Biden to withdraw the nomination. We all voted against her nomination last week during a committee business meeting,&#34; Barrasso continued.
&#34;She conspired with eco-terrorists. She lied to the Senate. She still holds radically reprehensible views,&#34; he added. &#34;Tracy Stone-Manning should never be the director of the Bureau of Land Management.&#34;

California&#39;s getting $27B from federal government despite $75B surplus; &#39;The Five&#39; react
Republican 
California
 gubernatorial candidate Kevin Faulconer unveiled a 
tax
 proposal he called &#34;the biggest middle-class tax cut in California history&#34; on Wednesday.
&#34;California has some of the highest income taxes, highest gas taxes, highest supplemental poverty rate in the entire country,&#34; Faulconer told Fox News in an interview before the announcement. &#34;California is too expensive, and it’s unaffordable for too many California families.&#34;

Under Faulconer&#39;s proposal, individuals would receive their first $50,000 in income tax-free and couples would get their first $100,000 in income tax-free. Faulconer&#39;s team says the proposal could save individuals as much as nearly $2,000 and families as much as nearly $4,000 per year.
&#34;99% of California households who pay income taxes will get a tax cut, and this is going to help our young people just starting out, help families put food on the table,&#34; Faulconer told Fox News. &#34;It’s enough to pay for eight months of utilities, or eight months of groceries or 92 tanks of gas.&#34;

California is among seven states 
losing a congressional seat
 due to population decrease, the Census Bureau announced in April. Faulconer said one goal of this plan is to keep Californians from &#34;voting with their feet&#34; and leaving the state.
&#34;This is a dramatic sea change and different from what you’re seeng from Gavin Newsom and the current administration who always want to raise taxes,&#34; he said. &#34;Everyone in Californa making under $1 million will get tax relief.&#34;
CALIFORNIA GOV HOPEFUL KEVIN FAULCONER TEASES ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT LOWERING TAX BURDEN
California Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
 
announced
 $600 to $1,100 tax rebates for struggling Californians, including undocumented people, earlier this week. Two-thirds of Californians will qualify for at least $600 in direct payments, accordng to Newsom&#39;s office. His office said it will send out a total of $12 billion in direct cash payments.
Faulconer told Fox News he doesn&#39;t think Newsom&#39;s plan is good enough.

&#34;One-time stimulus is not enough. Californians need lasting tax relief, not just for a year — going forward,&#34; Faulconer said. 
Faulconer&#39;s proposal would also align California with other states, including Texas and Florida, that do not tax military retirement income.
&#34;Under my plan, veterans will not pay a penny of taxes on their military retirement income. California is one of only three states in the entire country that fully tax retirement income. I’m changing that. I want our veterans to stay in California,&#34; Faulconer said.

The effort to recall Newsom, a Democrat, received the necessary number of verified signatures to 
trigger a recall election
 later this year. 
Faulconer was mayor of San Diego from 2014 to 2020.

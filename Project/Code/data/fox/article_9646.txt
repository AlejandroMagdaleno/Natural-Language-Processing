The first son has been profiting off the Biden name for years and recently found his way into the art world; reaction from &#39;The Five&#39;
Former 
President Obama&#39;s
 ethics chief ripped into 
President Biden&#39;s
 son, 
Hunter Biden
, for selling his art at prices ranging up to half a million dollars to anonymous buyers. 
Walter Shaub, the former Office of Government Ethics director under Obama, said that the lucrative arrangement has a &#34;shameful and grifty feeling to it.&#34;
&#34;The notion of a president&#39;s son capitalizing on that relationship by selling art at obviously inflated prices and keeping the public in the dark about who&#39;s funneling money to him has a shameful and grifty feel to it,&#34; Shaub told Fox News on Monday.

Shaub also warned that the anonymity granted to Hunter&#39;s clients could allow &#34;influence-seekers&#34; to funnel money to the Biden family. 
&#34;Just as hotel charges and real estate purchases created a risk of unknown parties funneling money to the Trump family for potentially unsavory purposes, Hunter Biden&#39;s grotesquely inflated art prices create a similar risk of influence-seekers funneling money to the Biden family,&#34; Shaub said.
Shaub said he thinks that Biden and his art dealer, Georges Berges, &#34;should disclose the identity of the purchasers&#34; so the public can see if the buyers try to &#34;gain access to [the] government.&#34;
He also said that the &#34;public should not have to take it on blind faith that government officials will behave&#34; regardless if &#34;any attempt to curry favor or buy influence is likely to succeed.&#34;
&#34;But I also think it&#39;s ridiculous that Hunter Biden is even going forward with this sale as a first-time artist,&#34; Shaub continued. &#34;He can&#39;t possibly think anyone is paying him based on the quality of the art. This smells like an attempt to cash in on a family connection to the White House.&#34;
&#34;At a minimum, the president should be asking his son not to go through with this auction,&#34; Shaub added.
The president&#39;s son came under fire last week after it was reported that Berges would be selling his artwork for between $75,000 and $500,000, depending on the size and scope of the collage artwork.

Hunter Biden&#39;s pieces are selling for more than a piece by Jean-Michel Basquiat that sold for $20,900 in 1984 – $53,770.96 in today’s dollars after adjusting for inflation.
The White House, Berges and Hunter Biden&#39;s attorney did not respond to Fox News&#39; requests for comment.
The Townsend Group, an agency representing Berges, previously defended the decision to keep Hunter Biden&#39;s art customers anonymous. 
&#34;Pricing fine art in his experiences as a Gallerist is based on the demand of the work as well and the intrinsic value of it,&#34; the agency 
told Fox Business
. &#34;His feeling is that within each piece – as with every artist, sales are always confidential to protect the privacy of the collector, this is standard practice for transactions in galleries as well as auction houses.&#34;

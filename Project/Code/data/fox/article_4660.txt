Rep. Rob Wittman R-Va., sits down with &#39;Fox &amp; Friends First&#39; to discuss what needs to be done against China for causing a global pandemic
House Republicans
 Wednesday called on the 
Biden
 administration and congressional 
Democrats
 to take more action to hold 
China
 accountable for the coronavirus pandemic as they released their GOP 
roadmap
 for achieving justice for the American people who suffered tremendous losses from the global pandemic.
The House GOP leadership outlined 
eight proposals
 to crack down on China, including new sanctions and visa restrictions on those in China who knowingly covered up information on the 
COVID-19
 outbreak.
BIDEN ADMIN NOW INVESTIGATING COVID ORIGIN &#39;BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC OUTCRY’: REP. MIKE TURNER
&#34;We need to impose sanctions so they feel the pain of what they have done,&#34; House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Wednesday at a Capitol news conference.

McCarthy was joined by GOP Whip Steve Scalise, Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik and other Republicans who argued that the Chinese Communist Party needs to pay for the more than 600,000 American lives lost during the coronavirus pandemic. The exact origin of the virus is unclear, but President Biden last month ordered an intelligence investigation into the onset of the virus, including any possibility it leaked from a Wuhan laboratory. 
&#34;The world deserves to know the truth,&#34; said Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. &#34;We need to find out why because we don&#39;t want this to happen again.&#34;
GOP LAWMAKERS URGE CLAMPDOWN ON CONFUCIUS INSTITUTES AT AMERICAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES
Democrats, however, said Republicans are trying to &#34;rewrite history&#34; and accused former President Donald Trump and McCarthy of inaction during the last year of the pandemic. 
&#34;As Trump gave China a pass on its coronavirus mismanagement, and even praised them for their ‘
efforts and transparency
,’ the House GOP Leader was silent,&#34; Democratic National Committee spokesperson Adonna Biel said in a statement. &#34;Americans have President Biden and Democrats to thank for leading us through this pandemic, delivering hundreds of millions of vaccinations, and rebuilding the economy, and they’ll see right through the staggering hypocrisy by Kevin McCarthy and the GOP as they try to rewrite history.&#34;
Other measures the GOP lawmakers proposed in their framework include declassifying intelligence related to the origins of coronavirus, banning so-called &#34;gain of function&#34; research in China, allowing families who lost loved ones to coronavirus to sue China for damages, and relocating the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.

House Republicans have long complained that Democrats weren&#39;t doing enough to investigate China&#39;s role in launching the pandemic and plan their own GOP forum for June 29 to hear from expert witnesses on the origins of coronavirus.

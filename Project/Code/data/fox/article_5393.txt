 CONCHA ON KAMALA HARRIS&#39; &#39;MEDIA BLACKOUT&#39; ON BORDER CRISIS: BIDEN ADMIN &#39;ACTING MORE LIKE PYONGYANG&#39;
KATIE PAVLICH: Based on the people that I talked to, the Pinal County Sheriff&#39;s Department and Chief Deputy Matthew Thomas, who took us out and the head of the anti-smuggling unit, there is no end in sight. ... They felt like they pushed smugglers back over the past four years and really gained ground against them. And now as a result of policies being shifted, this faucet has been turned back on and they feel like they&#39;ve lost a lot of ground and they&#39;re going to have to fight twice as hard to get it back. 
...
There are a few things that stood out: where we were is not on the border, it&#39;s 70 miles north of the border. And all the trash that you&#39;re seeing is a smuggling dumping area for when people who don&#39;t want to be caught, who are smuggled into the United States, what they do is they wear multiple layers of clothing, the top layer being camouflaged so they&#39;re not caught when they&#39;re crossing the desert. And then once they get to a drop point where they can get picked up and taken to Phenix, they&#39;ve shed all of their clothing so they look like civilians should they get pulled over by another law enforcement agency or police, for example. And so they&#39;re dumping all this trash in the desert. These photos were taken just steps away from a working farm near Stanfield, Arizona. 
...
And so this is happening and there are very, very bad people who are doing this. ... Because these people now are a more lucrative commodity than drugs. So it is more expensive and the cartels make more money by smuggling people into the United States than they do drugs in Arizona.

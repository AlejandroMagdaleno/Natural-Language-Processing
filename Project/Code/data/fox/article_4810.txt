Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee reacted to the migrant caravan headed to the U.S. and Big Tech’s push to ‘de-program’ Trump voters.
In response to some 
people
 claiming Trump supporters need to be &#34;
deprogrammed
,&#34; Fox News contributor Mike Huckabee on Tuesday explained why people voted for the former reality TV star to lead the country.
&#34;The first thing would be to get some of these leftist loons [to] take their boot off my neck. I don&#39;t need that, I&#39;m supposed to be a free American with the capacity to think for myself,&#34; Huckabee told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
.&#34;
&#34;If my views are as horrible as they think they are, then nobody will follow them,&#34; Huckabee said.
KATIE COURIC&#39;S &#39;CONDESCENDING, ELITIST&#39; REMARKS CALLING TO &#39;DEPROGRAM&#39; GOP RETIRES JOURNO LABEL, CRITICS SAY
Liberal journalists and social media voices have stepped up their calls to &#34;deprogram,&#34; deplatform or outright threaten right-leaning voices in the aftermath of the deadly 
Capitol riot
 earlier this month.
During an appearance Friday on &#34;Real Time with Bill Maher,&#34; former CBS News anchor 
Katie Couric ripped
 the Republicans in Congress who voted against impeaching President Trump over a charge of inciting rioters on Jan. 6.
&#34;The question is how are we going to really almost deprogram these people who have signed up for the cult of Trump,&#34; Couric said. 
Her language mirrored that of liberal Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson in the aftermath of the riot, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol building in a deadly melee.
Robinson said last week on MSNBC &#34;there are millions of Americans, almost all White, almost all Republicans, who somehow need to be deprogrammed,&#34; calling them members of a &#34;Trumpist cult.&#34;

Huckabee asserted that there is &#34;no cult&#34; of Trump supporters, but rather people who &#34;appreciate the many&#34; actions that President Trump made for the country such as &#34;standing up for the sanctity of life, standing with Israel by moving an embassy into that country, and resetting the Middle East.&#34;
&#34;I&#39;m glad he cut taxes, deregulated for businesses so that people had the highest number of jobs among Hispanics, Blacks and women in the history of the country. I&#39;m glad that he pushed back against China so we&#39;re not rolling over as these Communists continue to steal everything, including our information and our data and every single secret and innovation we&#39;ve created,&#34; Huckabee said.
&#34;There are some things that even a leftist ought to be able to look at and say, &#39;You know what? President Trump has done some good things,&#39; but they can&#39;t. And they&#39;re the ones who are following the cult, the cult of the left, that thinks somehow that they&#39;re always right, they&#39;re never wrong, and the rest of us are crazy.&#34;

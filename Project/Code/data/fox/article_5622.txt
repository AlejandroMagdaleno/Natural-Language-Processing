Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., addresses polarization within the Republican Party on &#39;Hannity&#39;.
The Republican Party appears split after Senate Minority Leader 
Mitch McConnell
, R-Ky., and former President 
Donald Trump
 exchanged harsh statements following Trump&#39;s 
impeachment
 acquittal by the Senate over the weekend, and 
Sen. Lindsey Graham
, R-S.C., told &#34;
Hannity
&#34; Tuesday the feud has got to stop.
&#34;Mitch McConnell working with Donald Trump did a hell of a job. They’re now at each other’s throat,&#34; he said. &#34;I’m more worried about 2022 than I’ve ever been. I don’t want to eat our own.&#34;
&#34;President Trump is the most consequential Republican in the party,&#34; Graham continued. &#34;If Mitch McConnell doesn’t understand that, he’s missing a lot ... We need to knock this off.&#34;
Graham explained that both Trump and McConnell could not have achieved what they did as president and Senate majority leader without the other, accomplishments that included a massive tax cut and the confirmation of three Supreme Court justices.

&#34;I believe the Democrats are doing all they can to help us,&#34; he said. &#34;We just need to help ourselves.&#34;

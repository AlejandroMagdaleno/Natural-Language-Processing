Andrew Yang, former Democratic presidential candidate, speaks at night four of the 2020 Democratic National Convention.
Former presidential candidate 
Andrew Yang
 has officially quit the 
Democratic Party
, calling it &#34;the right thing&#34; to do.
Yang announced he will become an independent in a blog post published Monday on his website and described doing so as a &#34;strangely emotional experience.&#34;
The former Democrat recalled registering with the party at 20 years old in 1995, amid then-President Clinton&#39;s push for reelection over former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.
BIDEN SAYS MANCHIN, SINEMA BEING CONFRONTED BY ACTIVISTS IS ‘PART OF THE PROCESS’
&#34;Throughout my twenties I remained a staunch Democrat, though like many others I was drawn primarily to national races,&#34; Yang 
wrote
. &#34;I co-hosted a small fundraiser for John Kerry’s campaign at a bar when I was 29 – I think we raised maybe $3,000.  I thrilled to Barack Obama’s victory in 2008 and, to a lesser extent, his re-election in 2012.&#34;
&#34;In 2016, I donated to Bernie Sanders’ campaign – everything he said struck me as true – but then voted for Hillary Clinton against Trump,&#34; he also wrote, saying he took former President Trump’s election &#34;as a red flag and call to action.&#34;
Yang recalled his campaigning as a Democrat and for President Biden, as well as the Democrat friends he made around the country and on stage as a primary opponent, noting he has been a Democrat his &#34;entire adult life.&#34;
&#34;And yet, I’m confident that no longer being a Democrat is the right thing,&#34; Yang wrote.
Although leaving the Democratic Party, Yang encouraged his supporters to not change their affiliation to be an independent as he did, claiming doing so would &#34;disenfranchise&#34; someone if they &#34;live in the 83% of the country that is very blue or very red.&#34;
Simultaneously, Yang wrote that the country &#34;is stuck in part because polarization is getting worse than ever.&#34;
Noting &#34;a shift&#34; in his &#34;mindset,&#34; Yang said that he &#34;can be even more honest about both the system and the people in it&#34; after dropping the Democrats.

&#34;Breaking up with the Democratic Party feels like the right thing to do because I believe I can have a greater impact this way,&#34; Yang wrote.
The Democratic National Committee did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment on the matter.

Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski argues through the former president&#39;s Operation Warp Speed the U.S. was able to produce PPE and not be reliant on China.
A top political aide to 
former President Donald Trump
 is calling for a commission to investigate the origins of the 
coronavirus pandemic
, which has claimed the lives of nearly 600,000 Americans.
&#34;Why don’t we have a commission,&#34;
 Corey Lewandowski
 told Fox News’ Chris Wallace in an interview Sunday on &#34;

.&#34;
POMPEO SAYS WUHAN LAB WAS ENGAGED IN MILITARY ACTIVITY AS WELL AS CIVILIAN RESEARCH
&#34;Let’s appoint Secretary Mike Pompeo and maybe Secretary Clinton, to look into why 600,000 Americans have died because of this,&#34; Lewandowski urged. &#34;Let’s hold China accountable. Let’s ask for the reparations which they own not only us but probably the world. And I think that $10 trillion sounds about the right amount to me.&#34;
The pandemic, the deadliest in a century, is widely believed to have originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 before sweeping across the globe early last year. The two leading theories are that the virus emerged in a wet market in the city, or that it escaped from a Chinese lab.
U.S. intelligence agencies continue to investigate whether the virus was sparked by human contact with infected animals, or if it was the result of a lab accident. 
President Biden
 late last month directed the intelligence agencies to report back on their findings in 90 days.
INTEL COMMUNITY ‘AGGRESSIVELY’ INVESTIGATING COVID-19 ORIGIN
Early last year, as the first cases of the virus were being reported in the U.S. and then-President Trump was downplaying concerns about the health threat, he also praised Beijing’s efforts to contain the pandemic, saying in early February that &#34;I think they’re doing a very good job.&#34;
A month and a half later, as the pandemic had swept the nation, 
Trump tweeted 
that &#34;Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much &amp; has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect.&#34; 
But around the same time, Trump started to emphasize what was then considered a fringe theory that the virus had escaped from a Wuhan lab. Trump’s repeated attacks on Beijing sparked angry reaction from China and was also downplayed by some experts and media outlets.
BIDEN: INTEL COMMUNITY TORN BETWEEN ‘TWO LIKELY SCENARIOS’ ON COVID-19 OUTBREAK SOURCE
&#34;When President Trump said we believe that this originated in a lab in Wuhan, the media by and large dismissed that,&#34; Lewandowski charged.
The lab theory has gained traction again in recent weeks, particularly after China has 
stonewalled a World Health Organization investigation
 into the origins of the virus, and reports that multiple lab workers were hospitalized in November with COVID-like symptoms
Pompeo, who is now a Fox News contributor, argued last weekend that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was engaged in military activity alongside its civilian research.

&#34;What I can say for sure is this: we know that they were engaged in efforts connected to the People&#39;s Liberation Army inside of that laboratory, so military activity being performed alongside what they claimed was just good old civilian research,&#34; Pompeo said on &#34;

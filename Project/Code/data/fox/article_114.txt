The 
Biden administration
 on Tuesday warned that &#34;all areas&#34; of 
Afghanistan
 are &#34;unsafe&#34; after an unknown number of Americans were left stranded in the country after the last 
U.S. troops
 left on Monday evening, ahead of the Aug. 31 deadline
The State Department issued a Level 4 travel advisory — the most severe travel advisory level — on Tuesday &#34;due to civil unrest, armed conflict, crime, terrorism, kidnapping and COVID-19,&#34; an alert on the department&#39;s website reads.
3-YEAR-OLD CHILD AMONG AMERICANS LEFT BEHIND IN AFGHANISTAN: REPORT
&#34;The Department of State assesses the risk of kidnapping or violence against U.S. citizens in Afghanistan is high,&#34; the department said in the alert, noting that the U.S. embassy in Kabul closed all operations Tuesday.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki last week pushed back against reports that Americans were stuck in Afghanistan, calling it &#34;irresponsible to say Americans are stranded.&#34;
Various reports published since Monday have indicated that a number of American families and individuals are still stuck in the country after being unable to get on planes in Kabul before the last U.S. troops departed.

 left Afghanistan
, likely leaving hundreds of Americans behind.

The general&#39;s comments echoed those of Psaki&#39;s from 
earlier in the day
, who acknowledged that there were a &#34;small number&#34; of Americans left in the country.
Psaki did not have a specific estimate for the exact number of Americans left behind, though a senior State Department official placed the total at &#34;below 250.&#34;

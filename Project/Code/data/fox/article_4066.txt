Republican governor calls for an increased federal vaccine supply on &#39;Your World&#39;
Georgia
 Gov. Brian Kemp defended his decision to 
halt the vaccination of teachers
 in his state on Monday, arguing that immunity to 
COVID-19
 among educators is not a prerequisite to safely 
reopen schools
.
Kemp has come under pressure in recent weeks to expand the current phase of Georgia&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine rollout to include educators, but the Republican governor told &#34;
Your World
&#34; on Monday that he does not intend to push teachers under 65 to the front of the line.
&#34;We know 65-year-olds are more adversely affected by COVID than those that are, you know, 45 or 50 or the teaching age,&#34; Kemp told guest host Charles Payne. &#34;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to do it, but we&#39;re really following the advice of public health officials.&#34;
Kemp said he would &#34;love to be vaccinating teachers right now,&#34; but intends to allocate his dwindling supply of available doses to the &#34;two million seniors and first responders and other folks that meet the current qualifications here in Georgia.&#34;
GEORGIA CLINIC THAT VACCINATED TEACHERS FACES 6 MONTH SUSPENSION
&#34;Hopefully, we’ll be able to expand soon when we get Johnson &amp; Johnson on board,&#34; he said. &#34;We want everybody vaccinated. But we&#39;re following the guidance and the public health data right now.&#34;
&#34;We need more supply from the federal government,&#34; he explained.
Kemp&#39;s comments come after Georgia’s Department of Public Health raided a medical clinic last week and confiscated its COVID-19 vaccines when it was revealed that the clinic was administering the vaccine to teachers.

Due to a limited supply of available doses in the Peach State, the vaccine is exclusively available to healthcare workers, first responders, and residents over the age of 65. 
&#34;If there&#39;s 65-year-olds in the school system, they&#39;re eligible to get vaccinated now,&#34; Kemp said. &#34;We would love to do teachers. But we&#39;re following the data and the science and trying to protect the most vulnerable to the virus.&#34;

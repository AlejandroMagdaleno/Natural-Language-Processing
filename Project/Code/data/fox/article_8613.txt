WASHINGTON (AP) – 
The 
Supreme Court
 on Monday brought an end to lawsuits over whether 
Donald Trump
 illegally profited off his presidency.
The justices threw out Trump&#39;s challenge to lower court rulings that had allowed lawsuits to go forward alleging that he violated the Constitution&#39;s emoluments clause by accepting payments from foreign and domestic officials who stay at the Trump International Hotel and patronize other businesses owned by the former president and his family.
The high court also ordered the lower court rulings thrown out as well and directed appeals courts in New York and Richmond, Virginia, to dismiss the suits as moot now that Trump is no longer in office.
The outcome leaves no judicial opinions on the books in an area of the law that has been rarely explored in U.S. history. 
The cases involved suits filed by Maryland and the District of Columbia, and high-end restaurants and hotels in New York and Washington, D.C., that &#34;found themselves in the unenviable position of having to compete with businesses owned by the President of the United States.&#34;

Florida congressman Carlos Gimenez discusses border visit and migrant surge on &#39;Your World&#39; 
President Biden
 is now urging 
migrants
 planning on embarking to the United States not to come. 
During an interview with ABC News that is set to air during Wednesday&#39;s &#34;Good Morning America,&#34; Biden was asked by George Stephanopoulos if it was a &#34;mistake&#34; for his administration not to &#34;anticipate&#34; the surge at the 
southern border
 following the 2020 presidential election. 
WASHINGTON POST WARNS BIDEN FACING &#39;POLITICAL THREAT&#39; FROM &#39;BORDER UPHEAVAL&#39;
Biden responded by pointing to other surges at the border in both 2019 and 2020, but Stephanopolous pushed back, saying &#34;this one might be worse.&#34;
&#34;Here&#39;s the deal: we are sending back people,&#34; Biden insisted before dismissing his critics who accuse him of encouraging migrants during the election to come when he takes office.  
&#34;Do you have to say quite clearly, &#39;don&#39;t come?&#39;&#34; Stephanopoulos asked. 
&#34;Yes, I can say quite clearly: don&#39;t come,&#34; Biden responded, later adding, &#34;Don&#39;t leave your town or city or community.&#34;

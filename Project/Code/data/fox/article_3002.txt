 ripped President Joe 
Biden&#39;s
 immigration policy on 
&#34;Fox &amp; Friends,&#34;
 and said that we don&#39;t have a country without a

BORDER &#39;DISORDER&#39; EXPLOITED BY POTENTIAL TERRORISTS, GOP LAWMAKERS SAY
DAN BONGINO: &#34;Who is the genius who’s sitting in a board room in Washington D.C. somewhere, or up on Capitol Hill saying, &#39;I’ve got a better idea. As we’re giving people money to tax it back let’s just open the southern border in the middle of a pandemic because this is a spectacular idea. There is nothing better than this.&#39;
Does anyone in that room say folks I have a question, I’m going to raise my hand. Not only are we in the middle of a pandemic, but we have this whole national security thing we’ve been talking about where we should probably vet people coming into the country. And everybody is like &#39;look at this idiot – national security, pandemic, borders – who needs any of that crap?&#39;

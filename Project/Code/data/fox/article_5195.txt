Former Kerry campaign staffer Zach Friend argues John Kerry will ‘hit the ground running’ as Climate Czar and Biden’s climate plans will send a ‘strong message’ internationally.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
 records indicate that the family of U.S. Special Envoy for Climate 
John Kerry
 owns a private jet, despite his position on combatting fossil fuels in the new administration.
The FAA&#39;s 
registry
 shows a Gulfstream Aerospace jet owned by Flying Squirrel LLC, the name previously reported for Teresa Heinz-Kerry&#39;s private charter jet company. The company&#39;s listed address matches that of the Heinz Family Foundation.
The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment. Neither did the Heinz family office. 
According to FAA records, the jet&#39;s registration certificate was issued in July of 2005 and expires in October of 2023.
While it&#39;s unclear exactly how much Kerry benefited from his wife&#39;s company, private jets have been estimated to emit 
upward of 40 times
 as much carbon per passenger as commercial flights.
CLIMATE CZAR NOMINEE JOHN KERRY UNDER FIRE FOR PRIVATE JET USE
&#34;We look forward to the anti-carbon lectures from a guy who travels the globe on private jets and luxury yachts,&#34; read a 
New York Post
 editorial last year.
During his 2004 presidential run, Kerry&#39;s campaign made 60 payments to his wife&#39;s charter jet company, totaling $273,171, the 
New York Post
 reported.
As late as 2013, his executive branch personnel financial disclosure 
showed
 Kerry owning &#34;over $1,000,001&#34; in assets for &#34;Flying Squirrel LLC&#34; through his wife.

Jim Laurie, a journalist who covered the fall of Saigon in 1975, discusses the &#39;tragic&#39; Taliban takeover that has left many, including journalists, stranded in Afghanistan.
House Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Rep. Michael McCaul warned that there is an &#34;even bigger&#34; terror threat than before the 9/11 attacks in the aftermath of

 falling to the Taliban, saying that the U.S. is engaging in &#34;dangerous foreign policy&#34; and sending a message of &#34;weakness.&#34;
During an interview with Fox News, McCaul, R-Texas, said the situation in Afghanistan is an &#34;unmitigated disaster&#34; and one that was handled by the Biden administration in &#34;completely the wrong way.&#34;
EVACUATION FLIGHTS ONGOING OUT OF KABUL
&#34;My fear is that President Biden is projecting weakness, not strength, and that is very dangerous in the international community,&#34; McCaul told Fox News, adding that the United States&#39; &#34;standing in the world has been greatly diminished.&#34;
&#34;I worry we are sending the wrong message to our allies and adversaries of weakness, our allies are questioning whether they can trust us, and our enemies no longer fear us,&#34; McCaul said. &#34;That is dangerous foreign policy to be engaged in.&#34;
He added: &#34;The image of the Taliban flag being raised over our embassy, I can&#39;t tell you how damaging that is going to be to our U.S. interests abroad.&#34;

McCaul added that the &#34;radical Islamist jihad world feels emboldened now.&#34;
McCaul went on to tell Fox News that there are &#34;greater numbers&#34; of Taliban, Al Qaeda and ISIS fighters than pre-9/11.
&#34;It is an even bigger threat,&#34; McCaul said, arguing the U.S. is &#34;even darker now&#34; with the embassy closed and &#34;without eyes and ears on the ground.&#34;
&#34;The winners here are the terrorists, Al Qaeda, the Taliban, Russia, Iran and China,&#34; McCaul said.
BIDEN STANDS ‘SQUARELY BEHIND’ DECISION TO WITHDRAW US TROOPS FROM AFGHANISTAN
McCaul told Fox News that the intelligence community has given a &#34;grim assessment&#34; of the situation in Afghanistan.
&#34;This is a great victory for the radical Islamist jihad world, and they will gain momentum from this,&#34; McCaul said, adding that officials have told him that the main priority for the international community, at this point, is to &#34;protect our homeland from external operations.&#34;
&#34;It is like watching history repeat itself,&#34; McCaul said.
As for President Biden&#39;s address to the nation, McCaul said he is being &#34;isolationist.&#34;
During his speech, Biden blamed his predecessor, former President Trump for the 2020 agreement with the Taliban, which would have seen a withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by May 1, 2021.
McCaul, though, pointed to his record.
&#34;President Biden has reversed every single Trump policy — the JCPOA, &#39;Remain in Mexico,&#39; but then he says he was bound by this agreement?&#34; McCaul said. &#34;He wasn&#39;t.&#34;

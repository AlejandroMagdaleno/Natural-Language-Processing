Since her inauguration, Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 has been living at Blair House, across the street from the 
White House
, while the U.S. Naval Observatory—the traditional home of the vice president—undergoes renovations. Now Ms. Harris’s former home in Washington, D.C.—a condo at the Westlight complex in the West End—is up for sale, according to the local multiple listings service and property records.
The property, which came on the market Monday for $1.995 million, will be the second property Ms. Harris has sold since taking office. Her San Francisco apartment, located in the California city’s SOMA neighborhood, sold in March for $860,000, far more than the $489,000 she paid for it in 2004, records show. Ms. Harris paid about $1.775 million for the Washington, D.C., apartment in 2017, records show.
KAMALA HARRIS TO FINALLY MOVE INTO VP MANSION AFTER RENOVATIONS
A spokeswoman for Ms. Harris didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The roughly 1,700-square-foot apartment has two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a den, according to the listing. The unit has natural oak hardwood floors, a spa-inspired bathroom with teak shower floors and a kitchen with a custom island and Italian cabinetry. The building has an expansive rooftop grilling terrace, a private club room, a 25-meter heated rooftop pool and fitness center, according to the listing.
KAMALA HARRIS HAS GONE 13 DAYS WITHOUT A NEWS CONFERENCE SINCE BEING TAPPED FOR BORDER CRISIS ROLE
Mei-Mei Venners, director of sales of the Westlight, declined to comment on the owner but said that the Westlight is &#34;the power and politics building in D.C.&#34; She also noted that the building was particularly well suited for Covid because it has a HEPA-grade air-filtration system.
Security was particularly tight at the building in the wake of the Nov. 3 election, The Wall Street Journal reported. Residents of the building were advised by management of new security protocols. For example, before entering the garage, residents would need to turn off their vehicles and allow a K9 to make a sweep around it, and all packages delivered by USPS, 
UPS
, 
FedEx
 and DHL would be swept by the K9 before being brought into the building.

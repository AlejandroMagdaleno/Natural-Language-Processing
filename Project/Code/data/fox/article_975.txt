Sen. Tom Cotton R-Ark., dissects the coronavirus stimulus bill and how it is hurting American families while helping the Washington elite.
Sen. 
Tom Cotton
 R-Ark., slammed President 
Biden&#39;s
 $1.9 trillion 
coronavirus
 bill Monday, calling it a &#34;payoff&#34; to 
Democratic
 Party constituencies and an example of &#34;the swamp&#34; looking after itself. 
On 
&#34;Fox &amp; Friends,&#34;
 Cotton said that the appropriation of individual stimulus checks favors federal bureaucrats over hard-working middle-class Americans.
Under the bill mandate, many Americans would receive a direct one-time $1,400 check. However, federal employees, as long as their children&#39;s schools remain closed, 
would receive
 that same $1,400 check every single week.
Additionally, the bill includes $350 billion for &#34;poorly-run&#34; states like California and New York, as well as healthcare subsidies to illegal immigrants. 
TOM COTTON AT CPAC TELLS CONSERVATIVES ‘WE WILL NEVER RETREAT’
TOM COTTON: &#34;One reason I think Joe Biden thinks there&#39;s no time to waste is that Democrats can see cases have plummeted since early January. They can see that we now have three effective vaccines, and vaccination rates are surging, so I think they&#39;re worried they won&#39;t have the coronavirus as an excuse to pay off all their clients and patrons in a $1.9 trillion blowout bill. 
As you said, less than a dime of every dollar goes to coronavirus. Just take a look at the payoff to some of their constituencies. $350 billion for states that are poorly run and that have longstanding problems but didn&#39;t even lose money because of the coronavirus, places like California and New York… 
$130 billion for schools but only a nickel of each dollar of that money is going to be spent this year. Most of it is for future years. Again, paying off teachers&#39; unions. And then maybe the worst of all, the worst of all, they&#39;re going to give a lot of Americans a $1,400 check. Federal employers are going to get that same check. They are also going to get $1,400 a week, every single week if their kids aren&#39;t in school.

So if you&#39;re working in the middle of the country, hard to make a living, you get one $1,400 payment once. If you&#39;re a federal bureaucrat in Washington where your schools are still closed, you get it every single week. Talk about the swamp looking out after itself.&#34;

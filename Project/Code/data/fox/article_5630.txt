Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., responds to Pelosi’s tweet calling her ‘that woman.’
Rep. 
Lisa McClain,
 R-Mich., called out 
Nancy Pelosi
 on Tuesday after the House Speaker referred to her as &#34;that woman,&#34; and asked the GOP congresswoman to apologize for her statements regarding Rep. 
Maxine Waters,
 D-Calif.
&#34;Speaker Pelosi, you need to learn this woman’s name and that’s Lisa McClain,&#34; said the Michigan representative during an appearance on 
&#34;The Faulkner Focus.&#34;
McClain asserted that Pelosi holds her party to a &#34;lower standard&#34; by defending Waters&#39; 
recent comments
 in Minneapolis while 
Republicans
 such as 
Marjorie-Taylor Greene
 and former President 
Donald Trump
 faced varying degrees of consequences for their speech. 
&#34;The Democrats have set a standard and all I’m asking is Madam Speaker, don’t you think we both should play by the same rules?&#34; McClain asked.
GOP CONGRESSWOMAN FIRES BACK AFTER PELOSI CALLS HER &#39;THAT WOMAN&#39;
McClain said that despite Pelosi’s comments she will continue to fight to &#34;expose&#34; the double standards exhibited by members of Congress. 
The GOP congresswoman also criticized Waters directly, claiming that she found it difficult to &#34;misinterpret&#34; the 
California
 representative’s comments urging protesters to become more &#34;confrontational.&#34;
 &#34;Words do matter,&#34; McClain said.
The back and forth between Pelosi and McClain began after Waters visited an anti-police brutality protest in Brooklyn Center, 
Minnesota,
 on Saturday evening, saying demonstrators needed to &#34;stay on the street,&#34; demanding justice until meaningful police reform was achieved
McClain appeared to reference Waters during a 
Monday speech
 on the House floor.
&#34;Once again, this weekend, we saw a member of the majority openly call for more confrontation in a Minneapolis suburb,&#34; McClain said. &#34;That very night, there was a drive-by 
shooting
 ... where police and the National Guardsmen were targeted.&#34;
McClain added that if roles were reversed and a Republican had told protesters to &#34;get more confrontational,&#34; the House majority &#34;would move to strip that representative of their committees and possibly move to expel them Congress.&#34;
&#34;That woman on the floor should be apologizing for what she said,&#34; Pelosi, told The Hill on Monday.

McClain responded on Twitter, saying that as &#34;that woman,&#34; she wouldn’t &#34;apologize for calling out the double standards&#34; set by Pelosi. 
Pelosi 
said
 Monday that Waters should not apologize for her comments and called criticism of her words a &#34;misrepresentation by the other side.&#34;

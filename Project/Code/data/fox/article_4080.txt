Former DC homicide detective Ted Williams weighs in on the deadly Georgia massage parlor shootings 
Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., connected last week&#39;s deadly 
Georgia
 shooting to his push for gun control and 
voting
 law reform on Sunday.
In an appearance on NBC&#39;s &#34;
Meet the Press
,&#34; Warnock called for &#34;reasonable gun control&#34; and a change in priorities for lawmakers.

Warnock then pushed the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, a bill to expand voting rights access that failed in the last Congress.
&#34;This is the reason why we&#39;ve got to stand up for voting rights in our country,&#34; Warnock said. &#34;We&#39;ve got to make sure that people from diverse backgrounds with their life experience, that they bring this to the great debate about the direction of our country. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve got to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.&#34;

President Biden
 celebrated his close relationship with labor unions Monday during an unscheduled 
Labor Day
 trip to a local branch of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Delaware, noting their critical role in advancing his political career.
Biden met with the union’s leadership, including IBEW President Lonnie Stephenson. He interacted with some workers during the short visit, declaring at one point that union members were the supporters who &#34;brung me to the dance,&#34; according to Bloomberg’s Jennifer Epstein.
The president brought sandwiches from a local Italian sub shop and spoke with the mother of one union worker by cell phone. He departed roughly 30 minutes after his arrival.
The union hall was a short ride away from Biden’s residence in Wilmington, Delaware, where he spent Labor Day weekend. The president flew to Delaware Friday from Louisiana, where he viewed the damage from Hurricane Ida.

IBEW Local 313 was established in 1902 and has 700 active members. The union’s workers have been assisting local communities that experienced damage in the hurricane by working on residential homes.

&#39;Special Report&#39; anchor discusses why Democrats want to make DC the 51st state on &#39;The Story&#39;
Admitting Washington D.C. to the Union as the 51st state is &#34;not realistic&#34; unless Senate Democrats are able to make &#34;the filibuster go by the wayside,&#34; Fox News chief political anchor 
Bret Baier
 told &#34;
The Story
&#34; Thursday. 
&#34;The argument for D.C. to be a state has been around for a long time. It was voted through in the House last June ... but fell short in the Senate,&#34; Baier explained. &#34;There have been people in D.C. who say it is taxation without representation. [Congressional delegate] Eleanor Holmes Norton is a shadow congresswoman, but she doesn&#39;t have a vote on the floor, [though] she can be in committees. There are no senators represented in the Senate.&#34;
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has claimed that denying the District of Columbia statehood is &#34;unjust, unequal and undemocratic,&#34; while Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., called opposition to the idea &#34;racist.&#34; On the Republican side, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, called the move a &#34;pure power grab&#34; by Democrats.
&#34;Republicans say, on substance, that&#39;s what the Founders wanted ... to have this place that was not a state to be the center of government,&#34; Baier added. &#34;They believe this is all about trying to keep hold of power for Democrats that have a slim hold right now.&#34;
HOUSE PASSES BILL TO MAKE WASHINGTON DC THE 51ST STATE
Host Martha MacCallum noted the push was a consequence of Donald Trump losing the 2020 presidential election: &#34;At that point [prior to November] all of those things seemed far away and radical, frankly. We&#39;re watching them tick off that list, or attempt to, one at a time.&#34;
The &#34;Special Report&#34; anchor maintained he thought the legislation would again die in the Senate.

&#34;This is the first in a series of bills that the House is going to move, including H.R. 1, to kind of bombard [Sen. Joe] Manchin, {D-W. Va.] and [Sen. Kyrsten] Sinema [D-Ariz.] and anybody who’s preventing the filibuster from going by the wayside [and] say &#39;you&#39;re not giving representation&#39; to the point that you wear them down and somehow, someway they relent on some big bill. 
&#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to happen, but I think that&#39;s the strategy.&#34;

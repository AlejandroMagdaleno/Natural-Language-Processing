Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., on introducing legislation aimed at increasing national security.
Tennessee
 Sen. Marsha Blackburn demanded a floor vote Thursday on her proposed &#34;End Child Trafficking Now Act,&#34; which would make DNA tests mandatory for any adult alien attempting to enter the U.S. with a minor.
&#34;Minors are especially vulnerable to trafficking and are often forced to perform sex acts,&#34; Blackburn said. &#34;Making DNA tests mandatory on anyone claiming a family relationship with a minor will send a powerful message that traffickers will be caught and aggressively prosecuted.&#34;
Separately, she told Fox News Wednesday that cartels were exploiting minors, forcing them to act as mules and carry drugs across the border between Mexico and Arizona.
BIDEN MAKES &#39;NO APOLOGIES&#39; FOR ENDING TRUMP-ERA MIGRANT PROTOCOLS
&#34;They put a wristband on them that shows they’ve either paid their fee [to be smuggled across across] or they need to work that fee out,&#34; she said. &#34;That’s called indentured servitude: Work that fee out once they get to the U.S. This is through sex trafficking, human trafficking, labor gangs, MS-13 and other gangs.&#34;
Sens. Blackburn, Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Mike Rounds, R-S.D., introduced the bill Wednesday.
&#34;Unaccompanied children are passing through our border with the help of strangers and members of cartels, putting these children at an increased risk of sexual abuse and human trafficking,&#34; Tillis said in a 
statement
. &#34;This is completely unacceptable and the Biden administration’s response has been severely lacking.&#34;
According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, one in four victims of human trafficking, also known as modern day slavery, are children – and the majority of forced laborers, including forced sex workers, are women and girls.
BIDEN SAYS MIGRANT FAMILIES APPREHENDED AT BORDER &#39;SHOULD ALL BE GOING BACK&#39;
Experts have warned that signs of potential human trafficking can include a lack of control over one’s own identification or travel documents, as well as traveling with older men – especially nonrelatives.
Blackburn’s legislation would target both of those indicators.
The senators have accused Biden of &#34;breaking&#34; the border after reversing many of former President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.
Biden, speaking during his first news conference since taking office Thursday, said he would make &#34;no apologies&#34; for ending Trump-era protocols – including the so-called Remain in Mexico policy that kept migrants across the border rather than in overcrowded detention facilities.

He said Trump’s immigration policies &#34;have an incredibly negative impact on the law…as well as on human dignity.&#34;

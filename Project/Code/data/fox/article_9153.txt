NEW TRUMP IMPEACHMENT POLL: 58% SAY FORMER PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONVICTED
As the former president’s motorcade rolled past the crowd, Trump waved to supporters from inside his vehicle. 
 
The rally was reportedly organized to mark Presidents Day and to celebrate Trump’s acquittal Saturday in his
 Senate impeachment trial.
The former president was acquitted of one count of inciting the attack on the Capitol. Trump was impeached by the House on Jan. 13, with 10 Republicans joining all 222 Democrats in the chamber in voting to impeach, and 197 Republicans opposing.
On Saturday, seven GOP senators joined all 50 Democrats in the Senate in voting to convict Trump. The tally was 10 votes shy of the 67 needed to convict Trump.

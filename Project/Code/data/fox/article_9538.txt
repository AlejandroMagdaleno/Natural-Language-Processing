Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the third dose of the coronavirus vaccine on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Three U.S. 
senators
 announced Thursday that they contracted 
COVID-19
 despite being fully vaccinated.
Sens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss.;Angus King, I-Maine, and John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., said they tested positive after experiencing mild or limited symptoms and are currently isolating to stop further spread of coronavirus. 
Positive COVID-19 tests among the vaccinated population are considered &#34;breakthrough&#34; cases amid the arrival of the highly contagious delta variant. 
&#34;I&#39;ve tested positive for a breakthrough case of COVID-19,&#34; tweeted Hickenlooper. &#34;I feel good but will isolate per docs instructions. I’m grateful for the vaccine (&amp; the scientists behind it!) for limiting my symptoms.&#34;
King still encouraged others to get vaccinated because he believes his symptoms would be much worse without it.

&#34;I am taking this diagnosis very seriously, quarantining myself at home and telling the few people I’ve been in contact with to get tested in order to limit any further spread,&#34; he added.
Wicker&#39;s communication director Phillip Waller said the senator sought a test due to &#34;mild symptoms.&#34;

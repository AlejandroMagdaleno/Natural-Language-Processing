Senate Majority Leader
 Chuck Schumer, D-
NY
, apologized on Monday after he used the word &#34;retarded&#34; in reference to developmentally disabled children during a podcast interview.
Schumer used the outdated term during a segment on Sunday&#39;s episode of the 
1 NYCHA podcast
 regarding congressional efforts to combat homelessness. When a co-host mentioned that some initiatives for sheltering homeless people have faced resistance in New York City, Schumer brought up the Biden administration’s proposed &#34;American Rescue Plan,&#34; as well as his own past experiences as a politician encountering opposition to housing proposals. 
&#34;When I first was an assemblyman, they wanted to build a congregate living place for retarded children,&#34; Schumer said. &#34;The whole neighborhood was against it. These are homeless kids, they just needed some help. We got it done, it took a while.&#34;
The word Schumer used is widely considered to be outdated, with some sources referring to its usage as a slur. In 2010, former President Barack Obama approved &#34;Rosa’s Law,&#34; which replaced the term &#34;mental retardation&#34; with &#34;intellectual disability&#34; in federal law and policy.
Politico
 was first to report on Schumer&#39;s apology.

A representative for Schumer said the senator apologized for his word choice, acknowledging it was &#34;inappropriate and outdated.&#34;
&#34;For decades, Sen. Schumer has been an ardent champion for enlightened policy and full funding of services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities,&#34; the spokesperson said in a statement. 
&#34;He is sincerely sorry for his use of the outdated and hurtful language,&#34; the statement added.

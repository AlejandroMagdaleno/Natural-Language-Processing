Bruce Castor weighs in on the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial on &#39;America&#39;s News HQ&#39;
The 
Philadelphia
 home of 
Trump
 defense attorney Michael van der Veen was vandalized Friday night. 
His wife discovered the word &#34;traitor&#34; spray-painted in red on the couple&#39;s driveway with a red arrow pointed at their house. 
&#34;My home was attacked,&#34; van der Veen said on Fox News Saturday. &#34;To answer your question, my entire family, my business, my law firm are under siege right now. I don&#39;t really want to go into that, though.&#34;

The van der Veens have since hired private security for their home. 
Detective Scott Pezick of the West Whiteland Township Police Department told Fox News that several patrols have driven by the home today and haven&#39;t noted any disturbances. 
No arrests have been made and there are currently no suspects in the case. 
The Philadelphia Inquirer 
reports
 that protesters also gathered outside van der Veen&#39;s office, chanting, &#34;When van der Veen lies, what do you do? Convict. Convict.&#34;
MCCONNELL RIPS TRUMP, SAYS ACTIONS &#39;UNCONSCIONABLE&#39; BUT TRIAL WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
Bruce Castor, another one of Trump&#39;s defense attorneys, said his home was also vandalized in some way. 
&#34;It’s been very unsettling. Mr. van der Veen’s house was vandalized last night,&#34; Castor said on Fox News Saturday. &#34;My house was the subject of unrest. These people are lawyers and they expect to do their jobs without having fear for their personal safety.&#34;
The homes of some Congressional leaders have also been vandalized recently.

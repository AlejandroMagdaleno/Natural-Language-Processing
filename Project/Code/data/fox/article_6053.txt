Sen. 
Mitch McConnell 
continued calling
 President Biden 
&#34;far-left&#34; despite White House objections, saying Wednesday there is &#34;nothing at all moderate about the administration so far.&#34; 
&#34;It&#39;s a hard left administration. Bernie Sanders is really happy about the way this is going,&#34; the 
Kentucky
 Republican said at a news conference at a hospital in Paducah, Ky.
&#34;My old friend Joe Biden seems to be fully in league with Bernie Sanders,&#34; McConnell added. 
&#34;That&#39;s the bad news. The good news is the Senate is 50-50,&#34; he added. McConnell said he hopes some Democrats will be wary about massive government expansion.

PSAKI SAYS BIDEN &#39;NOT EAGER TO BE LABELED&#39; AFTER MCCONNELL CALLS HIM LEFT-WING
&#34;I like him personally,&#34; McConnell said last week during a trip to another Kentucky healthcare facility, Owensboro Health Regional. &#34;I mean, we&#39;ve been friends for a long time, he&#39;s a first-rate person.

&#34;I don’t think this will surprise you but the president is not eager to be labeled by anyone in his party, or certainly even by his friend Mitch McConnell,&#34; Psaki said. 
MCCONNELL: BIDEN IS A &#39;FIRST-RATE PERSON&#39; BUT HE&#39;S RUNNING A &#39;BOLD LEFT-WING ADMINISTRATION&#39;
In his news conference Wednesday, McConnell walked back remarks he made about corporations needing to stay out of politics. &#34;I didn’t say that very artfully,&#34; the GOP leader said. 
&#34;They’re certainly entitled to be involved in politics. They are. My principal complaint is they didn’t read the darn bill,&#34; he added.

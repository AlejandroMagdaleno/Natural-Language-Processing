Fox News spoke with CPAC attendees in Dallas, Texas to discuss the potential inclusion of critical race theory in U.S. classroom curriculum
Black News Tonight host Marc Lamont Hill is facing backlash on 
social media
 after the 
Temple University professor
 claimed during an interview that all White people are &#34;connected to racism.&#34;
&#34;I don’t know if you’re backing me into a corner with that question but yes, I do,&#34; Hill said when asked the question directly by his guest, conservative political commentator Liz Wheeler. &#34;I do believe that all White people are at some level, at the unconscious level, connected to racism, its unavoidable. I think all men are sexist at some level. I think that’s absolutely the case.&#34;  
The comments were made during a discussion about critical race theory, with Hill pushing back against Wheeler&#39;s claim that CRT will be used in schools as a tool to promote Marxism.
CPAC ATTENDEES WEIGH IN: WHAT SHOULD PARENTS DO ABOUT CRT IN SCHOOLS?
Hill, who is a professor at Temple University&#39;s Lew Klein College of Media and Communication, shared the moment on his own Twitter account.
Former Maryland Republican Congressional nominee Kimberly Klacik was among Hill&#39;s critics who responded to the video, arguing Hill would &#34;regret this response.&#34;
&#34;That&#39;s like saying all Black people are ghetto,&#34; she added. &#34;It&#39;s neither true nor cool.&#34;
Another Twitter user asked if Hill was Marxist, to which he responded that he is &#34;neither a Marxist nor a Critical Race Theorist.&#34;
&#34;I do, however, think that both lend important insights that we should take seriously. Instead of demonizing, misrepresenting, or making them the subject of moral panic, let&#39;s actually listen and learn.&#34;
Some Twitter users came to Hill&#39;s defense, though one noted his word choice was not the best. Another user argued his sharing of the clip would only be used against him. 
Hill told Fox News in a statement that we &#34;live in a country in which racism is an intractable and unavoidable problem.&#34;
&#34;None of us can avoid being influenced by or connected to white supremacy, even if it is at the subconscious level. Even I, as a Black person, have to consciously unlearn white supremacy,&#34; he added. &#34;This is lifelong for everyone. Similarly, we must all unlearn sexism and homophobia, regardless of how progressive and well-intentioned we may be. None of us has clean hands. We must all work to be better. That starts with acknowledgment.&#34;

This is not the first time Hill has faced controversy for his statements. 
He was previously 
terminated from his role as a CNN contributor
 after calling for a &#34;free Palestine from 
the 
river to the sea&#34; during a 2018 United Nations speech, which was deemed anti-Semitic.
Hill later explained in a tweet that he supports &#34;Palestinian self-determination&#34; and is &#34;deeply critical of Israeli policy and practice.&#34;
&#34;I do not support anti-Semitism, killing Jewish people, or any of the other things attributed to my speech. I have spent my life fighting these things,&#34; he added. 
Temple University did not immediately return Fox News&#39; request for comment on Hill&#39;s latest remarks.

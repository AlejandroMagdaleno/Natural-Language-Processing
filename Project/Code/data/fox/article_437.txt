Arizona
 Gov. Doug Ducey announced Friday that he signed two bills regarding the 
education
 of the state&#39;s children.
House Bill 2906 blocks state-run schools and government entities from requiring training in critical race theory, which suggests that people are &#34;inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously,&#34; the governor wrote in a statement, 
according to FOX 10 of Phoenix
.
&#34;Here in Arizona, we’re going to continue to be leaders on civics education and teach important lessons about our nation’s history,&#34; Ducey continued.
Meanwhile, House Bill 2035 calls for curriculum transparency, so that 
parents
 can weigh in on topics such as sex education.
&#34;Parents should have the right to know what their children are learning in school,&#34; 
Ducey wrote
.
In Twitter posts Friday, Ducey thanked Arizona 
state lawmakers
 – including state Reps. Michelle Udall and Gail Griffin and state Sens. David Livingston and Nancy Barto, all Republicans -- for leading the efforts to get the bills passed.

The governor’s move on CRT drew praise from U.S. Rep. Debbie Lasko, a Republican who represents Arizona’s 8th Congressional District, northwest of Phoenix.
&#34;It’s great to see that @dougducey signed legislation into law to stop Critical Race Theory from infiltrating our schools and government entities!&#34; Lasko wrote. &#34;CRT advances a distorted version of history to divide our nation and dismantle our institutions. It has no place in Arizona.&#34;
U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., also praised the development.
&#34;This is a HUGE win for all Arizonans,&#34; Biggs wrote. &#34;Thank you AZ Legislature for pushing this through!&#34;
Critical race theory has faced opposition from parents and citizens groups across the U.S.
Earlier this week, parents from Pennsylvania and Kansas appeared on 
&#34;Fox &amp; Friends,&#34;
 where they said the threat of critical race theory in local schools inspired them to seek election to their local school boards.
&#34;I think that CRT is poisonous,&#34; Greg Dolan, a high school history teacher and father in Pennsylvania, 
told host Pete Hegseth
.
Amy Cawvey, a mother of three who is running for a school board seat in 
Kansas,
 said she was doing so to &#34;keep CRT out of our schools.&#34;

Some liberals and Democrats, meanwhile, have accused Republicans of manufacturing an &#34;imagined monster&#34; in an effort to galvanize voters.
&#34;The American people aren’t divided, the American people are being divided,&#34; liberal author Ibram X. Kendri 
recently wrote in The Atlantic
. His essay was titled, &#34;There Is No Debate Over Critical Race Theory.&#34;

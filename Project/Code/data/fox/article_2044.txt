U.S. Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., took aim at 
Education Secretary
 Miguel Cardona for controversial comments Cardona made about parents voicing their frustrations at school board meetings.
&#34;I was a little disturbed, and I want to see if you really meant the comment. And it was in relation to … ‘Why are they doing this?&#39; And I&#39;m going to quote this your response for that engagement was, ‘I think it&#39;s a proxy for being mad that their guy didn&#39;t win.&#39;&#34; the 
Indiana 
Republican told Cardona during a hearing Wednesday. 
&#34;And I know you probably didn&#39;t mean that, and I&#39;ll give you a chance to retract it,&#34; Braun said. &#34;Is that something you&#39;d want to take back?&#34;
Cardona responded by touting school boards’ commitment to returning students to classrooms but did not directly address the statement Braun was referring to.
&#34;What about the statement? And I agree with you 100% there, but would you want to take that back … not politicize something where I think it&#39;s an honest and sincere difference of opinion across the country, and I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d want to be on record with that,&#34; Braun pressed. 
Cardona again declined to directly address the comments.

&#34;I’ll take it that you don’t want to retract it at this point,&#34; Braun said, visibly frustrated. 
Cardona&#39;s comments were publicized in a 
Business Insider story 
in which the education secretary shared his thoughts on mask mandates and critical race theory.

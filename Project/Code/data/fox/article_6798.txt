New York police officers warned on loudspeakers that if the demonstrators did not move they would be arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.

&#34;What happened to me today was nothing compared to the brutality that far too many Black and Brown Americans have suffered at the hands of lawless police officers like Derek Chauvin,&#34; Donovan told Fox News.
&#34;I want to be crystal clear: George Floyd was murdered because he was a Black man. Period. If he looked like me, George would still be alive today. We will not let his death be in vain, and I will continue to partner with community leaders like Reverend McCall, who organized this demonstration, and organizations like the Crisis Action Center and Black Lives Matter to highlight the continued injustice being experienced by over-policed communities.&#34;
Donovan joined Black Lives Matter activists Chivona Newsome, Rev. Kevin McCall and attorney Sandford Rubenstein for Tuesday’s event.
McCall, who was arrested with Donovan, joked that they were &#34;cellmates.&#34;

&#34;So we disrupted and performed civil disobedience,&#34; he continued. &#34;But it’s about change. It’s about reform.&#34;
New York City’s primaries are set to be held in June.

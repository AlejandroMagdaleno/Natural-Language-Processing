West Virginia senator breaks down partisan COVID relief bill, president&#39;s cabinet nominees, and hopes for bipartisanship on &#39;Special Report.&#39; 
President Biden
 has picked the wife of an extremely influential U.S. senator for a federal commission post, the 
White House
 announced Friday. 
Biden nominated Gayle Conelly Manchin to co-chair the Appalachian Regional Commission, an economic development partnership with 13 states designed to boost investment in the Appalachian Region.
Manchin is an educator, past president of West Virginia&#39;s State Board of Education and the former first lady of West Virginia.

With Democrats holding the slimmest of majorities with a 50-50 split and Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote, Manchin&#39;s influence in the Senate has grown tremendously.
As a moderate from a red state, Manchin has openly pushed back on some of the Democrats&#39; boldest ideas, including the $15 minimum wage, eliminating the filibuster and far-reaching gun control legislation. His resistance has forced concessions.
AS BIDEN CALLS FOR GUN BAN, MANCHIN SAYS HE DOESN&#39;T SUPPORT BACKGROUND CHECK LEGISLATION
For example, during the passage of $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief legislation where Democrats needed to be totally united, Manchin and the White House were in 
negotiations
 that ultimately led to reducing the amount of unemployment insurance benefits in the final package that passed along party lines.

Former Minneapolis police officer Steve Dykstra on violent crime spiking in the city after George Floyd’s death.
Minneapolis
 Mayor Jacob Frey admitted the city has a shortage of 
police 
officers Friday, a day after a judge ruled the city needs to hire more cops by June of next year, according to reports. 
Frey called the high rate of attrition &#34;problematic&#34; and promised the city will focus on recruitment to bulk up the numbers, FOX 9 in Minneapolis reported. 
Hennepin County District Judge Jamie L. Anderson said the city needs to have at least 730 officers by June 30, 2022, or .2% of the population, in a decision over a lawsuit brought by the conservative Upper Midwest Law Center. The city is currently expected to have about 669 officers by next June.
&#34;Minneapolis is in a crisis,&#34; the plaintiffs wrote in the complaint, citing the rise in shootings and homicides and the violent George Floyd 
protests

Frey, a Democrat, said he &#34;always opposed&#34; defunding the police and said he &#34;entirely&#34; supports police Chief Medaria Arradondo. 
&#34;This is a both/and approach,&#34; Frey said, according to 
FOX 9
. &#34;We need community-oriented strategies that go beyond policing and you need officers as well. It is our intention to make sure that we are pushing for allocations both through [the American Rescue Plan] as well as through the ongoing budget to make sure we are bringing the necessary personnel into the Minneapolis Police Department.&#34;
Many officers in Minneapolis and elsewhere have left in the last year amid often violent anti-police protests.

&#34;Part of assisting [the chief] in getting the right outcomes,&#34; Frey continued, &#34;means that we need to give him the necessary tools that he needs to succeed.&#34;

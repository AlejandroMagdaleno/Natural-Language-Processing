President Biden
 said he did not know about the FBI plans to raid the home of former President Trump&#39;s personal attorney and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani before it happened, and that he learned of the operation &#34;when the rest of the world learned about it.&#34; 
NBC News 
asked
 Biden in a Thursday interview if he was aware of the FBI raid on Giuliani&#39;s home beforehand.
FEDS RAID RUDY GIULIANI APARTMENT IN UKRAINE INVESTIGATION
&#34;I give you my word I was not,&#34; Biden replied. &#34;I made a pledge. I would not interfere in any way or try to stop any investigation the Justice Department had underway. I learned about that last night when the rest of the world learned about it. My word — I had no idea this was underway.&#34; 
NBC&#39;s Craig Melvin then asked the president whether he had been notified by the Justice Department of other ongoing investigations.
ANDREW GIULIANI BLASTS FBI RAID ON DAD&#39;S HOME: &#39;THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ABSURD&#39;
&#34;No, and I&#39;m not asking to be briefed,&#34; Biden said. &#34;I&#39;m not asking to be briefed. That&#39;s the Justice Department&#39;s independent judgement. This last administration politicized the Justice Department so badly that so many quit, so many left because that&#39;s not the role — not the role of a president to say who should be prosecuted, when they should be prosecuted, who should not be prosecuted. That&#39;s not the role of the president.
&#34;The Justice Department is the people&#39;s lawyer, not the president&#39;s lawyer,&#34; he noted.

The FBI raided Giuliani&#39;s Manhattan apartment early Wednesday morning, seizing electronic devices as part its investigation into whether he violated the Foreign Agent Registration Act in his alleged dealings with Ukraine.

absurd

totally unnecessary
&#34; and was carried out to &#34;make him look like he&#39;s some sort of criminal.&#34;
Giuliani has not been charged with any crimes.
Giuliani will join &#34;

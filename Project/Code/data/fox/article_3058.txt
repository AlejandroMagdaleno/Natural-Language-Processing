Protesters clash in New York City
Mayor Bill de Blasio
 said Wednesday that his administration is &#34;looking at&#34; holding a lottery for 
New Yorkers 
vaccinated
 against 
COVID-19
 – like the one in Ohio that is offering $1 million to winners.
&#34;We are talking about whether that kind of approach would add something,&#34; 
de Blasio
 said during a City Hall press briefing.
&#34;We’re looking at models around the country and a lottery type idea is real interesting, so we’ll be assessing that and we’ll have more to say on that soon,&#34; said Hizzoner.
NEW YORK CITY WORKS TO TURN PAGE ON COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Last week, 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine 
announced that the Buckeye State will dole out a million bucks each to five lucky people who have received at least one dose of a 
COVID-19
 vaccine through a new lottery.
In an effort to encourage people to get the jab, New York has offered more modest rewards so far – including a free two-week membership to Citi Bike, free fries at Shake Shack, a free weekly MetroCard, and most recently a chance to win playoff tickets for the Brooklyn Nets.
Around 3.8 million New York City residents – or 59% of the 
Big Apple’s
 adult population – has received at least 
one vaccine shot
, while 49% are fully inoculated, city data shows.
&#34;Every day we’re seeing continuing progress on vaccination,&#34; de Blasio explained. &#34;I think the number one reason that’s happening is because we’ve made it ever more convenient, more local, walk-in, mobile vaccination centers.&#34;
&#34;I think all of this is making it real easy for people,&#34; de Blasio said.

The mayor said he thinks the incentives are helping, too.
&#34;It’s an opportunity to get Nets playoff tickets if you get vaccinated. That’s going to motivate people,&#34; he said. &#34;A lot of the other incentives are going to motivate people.&#34;

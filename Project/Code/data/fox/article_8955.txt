Wright is the widow of late Republican congressman Ron Wright who died earlier this year from the coronavirus. Former President Donald Trump endorsed Wright in April but despite not having the endorsement of the former president, Ellzey raised more than $1.2 million, which was nearly twice as much money as Wright. 
The race was considered by some as a referendum on Trump&#39;s influence on the GOP, though turnout in the special election was low. Trump got involved in the election this week blasting out robocalls in support of Wright.

President 
Biden
 addressed hecklers who shouted at him about his chaotic withdrawal from 
Afghanistan
, claiming that they don’t actually live in the area he was touring and suggesting that they were upset about his 
climate change
 position.
After Senate Majority Leader 
Chuck Schumer,
 D-N.Y., introduced Biden as the man who will &#34;lead us out of darkness in this present moment,&#34; the president began his remarks in New York City by saying he received a warm reception in the area he had been touring.
&#34;None of them were shouting or complaining,&#34; Biden said. &#34;Every one of them were thanking me as if it was something special … that I was here.&#34;

&#34;The people who stand on the other side of the fences, who don&#39;t live there, who are yelling that we&#39;re interfering with free enterprise by doing something about climate change — they don&#39;t live there,&#34; Biden said. &#34;They don&#39;t understand.&#34;
The president invoked climate change multiple times in his speech and said that the scientific community has issued a &#34;code red&#34; and concluded that climate change is an &#34;existential threat&#34; to the United States.

&#34;The nation and the world are in peril,&#34; Biden said. &#34;That&#39;s not hyperbole. That is a fact.&#34;
At the conclusion of the speech, Schumer pointed out a child on a nearby ledge with an American flag and Biden joked with the child by saying &#34;Don&#39;t jump!&#34; after telling him that America&#39;s &#34;diversity&#34; is what gets the country through tragic natural disasters.

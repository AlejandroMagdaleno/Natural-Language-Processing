Florida governor and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott weigh in on election reform on &#39;The Ingraham Angle&#39;
Florida
 
Gov. 
Ron 
DeSantis
 announced that his state would be rewarding the 
police
 and other first responders with $1,000 bonuses for doing their lifesaving work amid the 
COVID-19
 pandemic.
DeSantis made the announcement Wednesday, flanked by first responders and members of law enforcement during a news conference in front of the Satellite Beach Police Department.
During the event he also announced he would sign the state&#39;s budget.
The police officers surrounding the governor applauded DeSantis for the move, which he said would fund the police &#34;and then some,&#34; throwing sand in the face of progressives who want to defund law enforcement.
&#34;I asked the legislature in this legislative session, we need to do bonuses for law enforcement,&#34; DeSantis said. &#34;Some wanted to defund the police, we’re funding the police, and then some.&#34;

Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody — whose husband is a Drug Enforcement Administration agent — also weighed in on Twitter, lauding DeSantis and the Florida legislature for the bonuses.
&#34;Amazing news on this greatly deserved bonus for our first responders and law enforcement officers!&#34; Moody wrote on Twitter.
&#34;Thank you, [DeSantis], [Florida state Senate] and [Florida House of Representatives] for prioritizing the men and women who have dedicated their lives to serving and protecting our state,&#34; she added.
Satellite Beach Police Chief and president of the Florida Police Chiefs Association gave 
kudos
 
to DeSantis for his &#34;unwavering&#34; support of police and first responders.
&#34;With your strong and consistent leadership, law enforcement can count on you [...],&#34; Pearson said. &#34;And most importantly, the people of Florida can count on you.&#34;

The $1,000 payments will be doled out to every first responder who continued their work through the coronavirus pandemic — including firefighters, EMTs and the aforementioned police — in a one-time payment.
DeSantis’ announcement comes as progressives continue to pound the drum calling for the defunding of police following the murder conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.

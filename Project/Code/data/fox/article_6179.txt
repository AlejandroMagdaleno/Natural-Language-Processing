Calls by state Republicans to investigate the governor gain steam amid allegations she paid $155,000 in hush money to a former state health department director. Reaction from Rep. Steve Johnson on &#39;Fox &amp;amp; Friends First.&#39;
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer defended her administration&#39;s controversial payouts to three departing state officials that have Republicans in the state demanding details and eyeing subpoenas.
Whitmer, a Democrat, was asked about the agreements during a press conference on Tuesday, where she defended the &#34;separation agreements&#34; by saying they are &#34;used often&#34; both in business and the public sector when an organizational leader leaves their post.
&#34;And, due to the nature of the agreement, there&#39;s not a lot more that I can say on the subject,&#34; the Wolverine State governor 
said
.
The Michigan governor was pressed on whether the deals amount &#34;hush money,&#34; as alleged by state Republicans.
&#34;I really bristle at that characterization,&#34; Whitmer responded. &#34;The nature of the separation agreement is that when someone leaves, there are terms to it and you cannot share every term to it. That&#39;s simply what it is.&#34;
Whitmer&#39;s did not immediately return Fox News&#39; request for comment on the exchange.
Michigan GOP communications director Ted Goodman blasted Whitmer on Wednesday, claiming she appeared to be &#34;buying the silence&#34; of top state health officials amid the coronavirus pandemic.
&#34;Gov. Gretchen Whitmer appears to be buying the silence of high-level government employees during the greatest public health crisis of our time,&#34; Goodman said in a statement released to Fox News.
&#34;If there&#39;s nothing to hide, the governor and these former employees should provide details surrounding these payoffs and confidentiality agreements.&#34;
&#34;Michiganders deserve to know,&#34; he added.
The scrutiny comes following revelations that former Michigan Department of Health Director Robert Gordon and Whitmer had quietly reached a 
secret separation
 agreement that netted a $155,506 payout for Gordon.

Since then, 
two more
 confidential deals between Whitmer&#39;s administration and other departing state officials have surfaceed. Former Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency Director Steven Gray took home almost $86,000. Gray’s deal contained a confidentiality agreement similar to Gordon’s.
Gordon’s deputy director, Sarah Esty, also took a separation deal with the state that included four 
weeks
 of &#34;paid administrative leave.&#34; The agreement did not say how much Esty would be paid, but four weeks of paid leave at her salary would reportedly equate to around $11,000.

Whitmer is also facing scrutiny for her handling of 
nursing homes
 during the coronavirus pandemic.
The Michigan governor on Tuesday was 
threatened
 with a subpoena by state GOP lawmakers who accused the governor of having &#34;bought the silence&#34; of her former employees.

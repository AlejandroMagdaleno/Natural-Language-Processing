Sohrab Ahmari, New York Post op-ed editor, says U.S. taxpayers are funding Hunter Biden&#39;s art display after the gallery&#39;s federal COVID-19 relief loans increased when President Biden won the election.
A report published Tuesday contends that President 
Joe Biden
 could get tied up in the ongoing FBI investigation into his son 
Hunter Biden
’s finances due to the sharing of bank accounts and payment of each other’s bills.
Emails 
obtained by DailyMail.com
 from Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop show that his business partner, Eric Schwerin, was working on Joe Biden’s tax returns and discussing the father and son paying each other’s bills.

Additionally, the emails show that Schwerin fielded book deal requests for Joe Biden, who was vice-president at the time, and also managed the donation of Biden’s Senate papers to the University of Delaware. 
Hunter Biden has claimed that he and his father shared a bank account and admitted last year that he was under federal investigation over his taxes.
Emails show that on April 9, 2010, Schwerin wrote to Hunter: &#34;I was dealing all afternoon with JRB&#39;s taxes (but solved a big issue - so it was all worth it).&#34;
On June 10 of the same year, Schwerin wrote, &#34;Your Dad&#39;s Delaware tax refund check came today. I am depositing it in his account and writing a check in that amount back to you since he owes it to you. Don&#39;t think I need to run it by him, but if you want to go ahead. If not, I will deposit tomorrow.&#34;
It is unknown what specifically Joe Biden owed Hunter money for.
An expert on money laundering and criminal tax law told DailyMail.com that those entanglements could drag the current president into the FBI’s investigation.
&#34;Whatever transaction you&#39;re looking at, if there&#39;s a connection to a family member or a friend, sure the answer is yes [they would be investigated],&#34; the expert, a former federal prosecutor who requested not to be named, told DailyMail.com. &#34;Obviously, if you&#39;re talking about the President of the United States, you&#39;d better have a pretty damn good reason to talk to that person.&#34;

The FBI and IRS are reportedly also investigating Hunter Biden’s business relationships and the possibility that money laundering charges are in order.
Another expert, former U.S. Intelligence Officer and Treasury Special Agent John Cassara, told DailyMail.com that President Biden would already be in the crosshairs if not for the fact that he’s the president.
&#34;The information available publicly is very worrisome, particularly in the areas of corruption,&#34; Cassara said. &#34;They could go at this from all different avenues. Follow the corruption trail and then charge money laundering.&#34;

Cassara added: &#34;Corruption is a predicate offense for money laundering. And besides corruption, it&#39;s the perception of corruption. This kind of thing should not be happening. It undermines full faith in the U.S. government. It undermines trust and our international reputation. It&#39;s an embarrassment.&#34;
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News.

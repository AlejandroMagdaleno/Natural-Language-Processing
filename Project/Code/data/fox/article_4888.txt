Rep.
 Ilhan Omar
 made a pitch for gun control in offering her condolences for Friday’s Capitol attack, in which a Capitol Hill police officer was killed by a man with a knife. 
&#34;Heartbroken to learn another CP was killed while protecting the Capitol. My thoughts and prayers go out to the officer’s family and the entire Capitol Police force,&#34; the Minnesota Democrat wrote in a tweet. &#34;The death toll would have been worse if the assailant had an AR-15 instead of a knife.&#34;
On Friday a suspect identified as Noah Green, 25, rammed his car into a barrier outside the Senate complex before lunging at Capitol Police officers with a knife. One officer was injured and another, officer William &#34;Billy&#34; Evans, died. The suspect was killed by police. 
Democrats have renewed their calls for gun control in light of three mass shootings over the last month. Eight were killed in a series of attacks in Atlanta, Ga. on March 16. On March 22, ten were killed when a gunman opened fire at a grocery store in Boulder, Colo. Four were killed, including a 9-year-old child, at a business complex in Orange, California on Wednesday.

President Biden and members of his party have called on the Senate to pass two House bills -- one that would broadly expand background checks and another that would give authorities 10 days rather than three to complete background checks before a sale must move forward. 
The bills are not expected to pass the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate. 
Others have called for further-reaching bans on &#34;assault weapons,&#34; such as the AR-15. 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., each introduced an &#34;assault weapons&#34; ban in their chamber earlier this month amid a &#34;rise in domestic terrorism,&#34; in Feinstein&#39;s words.

President Biden pushed an assault weapon ban as part of the 1994 crime bill, and has said it &#34;brought down these mass killings.&#34; Biden renewed a call to ban assault rifles and high-capacity magazines after the Boulder shooting.

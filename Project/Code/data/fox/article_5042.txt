House Majority Whip reacts to Mike Pompeo saying China policies amount to &#39;genocide&#39; on &#39;America Reports&#39;
House Majority Whip
 James Clyburn, D-S.C., declined Tuesday to take a stance on whether 
China
 is committing genocide against ethnic Uighur Muslims in the northwestern province of Xinjiang, telling &#34;
America Reports
&#34; that &#34;I try to stay out of these foreign affairs matters.&#34;
&#34;I have not made that a particular endeavor of mine here in the Congress,&#34; Clyburn told co-host Sandra Smith. &#34;I listen to these things and I usually reserve comment when they are bordering on international issues, and I will today as well.&#34;
Earlier Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that he had determined the Beijing government &#34;has committed genocide against the predominantly Muslim Uighurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.
&#34;I believe this genocide is ongoing, and that we are witnessing the systematic attempt to destroy Uighurs by the Chinese [Communist] party-state,&#34; Pompeo said in a statement. &#34;The governing authorities of the second most economically, militarily and politically powerful country on earth have made clear that they are engaged in the forced assimilation and eventual erasure of a vulnerable ethnic and religious minority group, even as they simultaneously assert their country as a global leader and attempt to remold the international system in their image.&#34;
When asked by Smith if he supported Pompeo&#39;s declaration, Clyburn responded: &#34;I have not studied it either, you know, I don&#39;t react to headlines. I tend to see exactly what leads to these headlines. You know, what&#39;s got us in so much trouble in this country today is sound bites. People reacted to sound bites. And then we look at it [and] you see that that&#39;s not what the substance is.&#34;
Smith tried again by noting that President-elect Joe Biden&#39;s nominee to be treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, had stated that 
China is guilty
 of &#34;horrendous human rights abuses.&#34;
&#34;How do you answer that question?&#34; she asked. 
POMPEO DESIGNATES CHINA&#39;S TREATMENT OF UIGHURS AN &#39;ACT OF GENOCIDE&#39;
&#34;Well, once again, I&#39;m going to see how these international issues -- Pompeo is not one of my favorite people and doing something like this on the last day in office, [I] wish that transition had taken place in a normal way so that the Biden administration would be a part of these kinds of issues. To just do these kinds of things on the last day in office [is] putting people in real sensitive positions and trying to make it difficult for the incoming administration. I&#39;m just not going to get into that.&#34;
&#34;But, as far as what you know, as far as the actions that China has taken, that President Xi [Jinping] has taken, do you believe that he is guilty of genocide, knowing what you know today?&#34; Smith asked. &#34;It&#39;s incredibly important that we know where the incoming administration stands on that as well.
&#34;You can ask me it as many times as you wish,&#34; Clyburn answered. &#34;I&#39;m not going to get into that. I&#39;m going to wait to see what an administration that I trust, what conclusions they come up with before I get into it. I&#39;m not going to pass judgment on that.&#34;

Clyburn&#39;s non-committal stance appears to be at odds with the president-elect, whose 
campaign declared in August
 that China&#39;s &#34;unspeakable oppression&#34; of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities &#34;is genocide and Joe Biden stands against it in the strongest terms.&#34;
The House Majority Whip&#39;s non-answers drew a sharp response from Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who told Fox News in a statement: &#34;Confronting the Chinese Communist Party’s genocide should be bipartisan. Americans ought to be united against a genocidal regime that rapes and tortures Uighurs. Human dignity isn’t a partisan issue.&#34;

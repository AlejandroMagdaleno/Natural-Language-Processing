North Carolina
 
Rep.
 Madison Cawthorn 
married
 fiancée Cristina Bayardelle over the weekend in a private ceremony.
The 25-year-old politician rose to prominence after defeating former President Donald Trump&#39;s handpicked candidate in the 2020 Republican primary, before winning his seat for the current term.
A handful of 
photos
 and a 
video
 appeared online from the event, which occurred seven years to the day that he was crippled in a car accident. Cawthorn himself tweeted photos showing him standing up during the ceremony.
In a statement
, Cawthorn said, &#34;Marrying Cristina Bayardelle, now Cristina Cawthorn, is the greatest honor, privilege, and adventure of my life. I am so grateful to celebrate this occasion surrounded by so many friends and family.&#34;
Cawthorn introduced his fiancée to the public in a 
tweet from October
 that described Bayardelle as an anesthesiologist assistant and a CrossFit athlete.
Bayardelle said that the couple met through a mutual friend and &#34;hit it off,&#34; and after four months &#34;knew he was the one.&#34;

Cawthorn said in the video that he had &#34;never seen a girl do that many pullups at one time.&#34;
Cawthorn spent months learning how to kneel so he could propose – a difficult task after a 2014 car accident left him paralyzed from the waist down,

The ceremony came a month after the congressman faced 
renewed allegations of sexual misconduct
 from his time at college.
Such allegations were made last year, during the campaign, but a handful of women recently spoke out about Cawthorn inviting them on &#34;fun drives&#34; where he would make sexual advances.

Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., says the solution to the border crisis is to reinstate Trump-era policies that were reversed by the Biden administration. 
President 
Biden’s
 nominee to head up the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) once called for pausing Customs and Border Protection (CBP) funding during the Trump administration.
Ur Jaddou
 is the current director of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Watch at America&#39;s Voice, a pro-amnesty nonprofit, as well as an adjunct professor at the American University School of Law. Biden announced her nomination on Monday.

Jaddou took aim at the department&#39;s immigration agencies during the Trump era, calling for Congress to 
pause CBP&#39;s funding
 last July until the agency &#34;stops attacking peaceful protesters around the country&#34; and has &#34;real reform and meaningful accountability.&#34;
She also referred to CBP as the &#34;personal militia&#34; to former President Donald Trump.
&#34;As our states, cities and towns are begging for more funding to stave off an economic collapse in the midst of a once-in-a-century pandemic, CBP has the audacity to propose moving money around, defying Congressional opposition so that their agents can continue to be the personal militia of the President,&#34; wrote Jaddou.
Jaddou was also quoted in the 
Cronkite News
 last April claiming that Trump was using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to turn people away at the southern border.

&#34;That was a goal from Day One, and he found the perfect opportunity to do it,&#34; Jaddou told the Cronkite News.
Additionally, America’s Voice — where Jaddou works — has in the past 
called 
for all families held in migrant facilities to be &#34;released&#34; and referred to US Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) as a &#34;
rogue agency

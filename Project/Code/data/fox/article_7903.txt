Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, shares why he made the decision on ‘America’s Newsroom.’
One day after 
announcing he will not seek reelection
 to the 
U.S. Senate
 in 2022, Senator 
Rob Portman
 said increasing partisanship had played into his retirement.
&#34;I love public service, and I hope more people who are interested in making a difference in people’s lives get into it, but it is a tougher time to do it,&#34; Portman told 
Bill Hemmer
 and 
Dana Perino
 on &#34;
America’s Newsroom
&#34; on Tuesday. &#34;It’s a harder time to find that middle ground.&#34;
OHIO SEN. ROB PORTMAN NOT RUNNING FOR REELECTION IN 2022
Portman, currently the top 
Republican
 on the Senate’s 
Homeland Security
 committee, has represented 
Ohio
 since 2010 and was reelected to his seat in 2016. He 
previously spent twelve years
 in the House and served as United States Trade Representative under President George W. Bush.
After decades of government service, Portman said he looks forward to spending more time with his family after his term ends.
&#34;I also love my family,&#34; Portman said. &#34;I love being home, and I love the private sector. So, it’s a personal decision also.&#34;

The Republican senator said the pending Donald Trump impeachment trial has no effect on his decision to retire, but he will take his role in the trial seriously. 
&#34;Not at all. And it’s not going to affect, you know, how I deal with impeachment,&#34; Portman said. &#34;I’ve said all along I’m a juror. I’m going to listen to both sides, as I did last time.&#34;

Looking ahead, Portman said he believes finding common ground would best help the nation move forward.
&#34;The question is, how do we heal our country at this point?&#34; Portman said. &#34;How do we figure out a way to solve these big problems? And that has to start with trusting each other and working with each other and finding that common ground.&#34;

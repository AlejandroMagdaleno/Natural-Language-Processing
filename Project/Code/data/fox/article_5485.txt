Republican California gubernatorial candidate 
Larry Elder
 had eggs thrown at him while walking in 
Los Angeles
 on Wednesday. 
Elder was walking through the Venice neighborhood with members of his campaign team when the attack happened. 
Videos of the incident show a first egg flying through the air and nearly hitting Elder. A member of Elder&#39;s team is then seen putting his arm on the candidate&#39;s back and saying: &#34;We&#39;re getting egged from behind.&#34;

Shortly after that, someone threw a second egg towards Elder and his team. It is unclear from the videos if Elder was hit by any eggs. A video posted to Twitter shows a woman in the gorilla mask threw at least one of the eggs. 
Multiple people also became physically aggressive towards Elder&#39;s team, including the woman in the gorilla mask who appeared to slap a staffer in the face. 
One man could be heard calling Elder a &#34;piece of s--t&#34; as Elder was escorted into his vehicle.

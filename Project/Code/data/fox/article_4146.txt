Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman calls the Kabul airport a &#39;kill zone&#39; as Americans are told to avoid it
Multiple 
House Republicans
 slammed 
President Biden 
and his administration Saturday and warned that U.S. citizens weren&#39;t able to reach the airport gates in 
Afghanistan
 as the Aug. 31 deadline rapidly approaches.
Reps. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, and Mike Waltz, R-Fla., took to Twitter to express outrage over the Biden administration&#39;s handling of the evacuation of U.S. citizens from the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan.
&#34;America, you need to know this: Biden is not letting US citizens through the airport gates. It has been impossible to get anyone through for the last 24 hours,&#34; Crenshaw tweeted. &#34;This administration has been lying about their intent to save Americans. Unforgivable.&#34;

Jackson tweeted that he was &#34;furious&#34; and that his office had been on the phone all day trying to get American citizens out of Afghanistan, but claimed the 
State Department
 wouldn&#39;t help those stranded outside the airport.
Jackson followed up in another 
tweet
, saying that President Biden was going to &#34;get them killed.&#34; Waltz echoed the other two Congressmen in a tweet late Saturday night, saying, &#34;Our fellow Americans will soon be left behind.&#34;
Republican members of Congress weren&#39;t the only ones tweeting about U.S. citizens being turned away at the Kabul Airport. Rep. Andy Kim, D-N.J. 
tweeted a long thread 
Saturday detailing similar scenarios that the Republican Congressmen tweeted about, saying, &#34;There are more citizens/residents that I am hearing from, as well as thousands of Afghans - including those who served alongside our military that are reaching out in desperation in these final hours.&#34;
&#34;As we hit 72 hours away from Biden’s Aug 31 deadline for ending the evac mission, I’m still hearing from American Citizens, including a child, in Kabul that are terrified of being left behind,&#34; Kim tweeted. &#34;This is their story(protected) and why we must complete the mission.&#34;

said
 on Saturday that there are 350 American citizens still in Afghanistan waiting to be evacuated and added they will be providing &#34;assistance around the clock.&#34; A State Department spokesman also said there have been at least 5,400 Americans safely evacuated since Aug. 14.

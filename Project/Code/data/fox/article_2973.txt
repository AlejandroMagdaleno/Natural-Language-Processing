Documents obtained exclusively by FOX News raise questions on why Department of Health excluded hospitalization deaths; Bryan Llenas on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Here was one way to shed a light on the sexual harassment allegations against Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
.
A light display on an Albany skyscraper was temporarily changed from &#34;NY Tough&#34; to &#34;NY Touch&#34; on Friday night in an apparent jab at Cuomo, whose accusers include 
a female aide who says he groped her
 under her blouse.
The phrase was spotted 8 p.m. Friday on the side of the city’s Corning Tower by News 10 anchor and reporter Trishna Begam, who 
tweeted a photo
 of it.

Usually, a display of &#34;NY Tough&#34; adorns the 44-story downtown building, which is the catchphrase adopted by the Cuomo administration amid the coronavirus pandemic.
By 8:24 p.m., the message was corrected to its original form, according to Begam.
Cuomo has been 
accused
 by several women, including many former and current aides, of sexual harassment and other inappropriate behavior.
One woman, an unidentified assistant, has alleged Cuomo groped her inside his office in Albany’s Executive Mansion.

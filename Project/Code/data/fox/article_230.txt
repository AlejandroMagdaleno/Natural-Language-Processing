The &#39;Special Report&#39; All-Star Panel discuss the multiple accusations against the New York governor
Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 may have just done for blankets what Sen. 
Bernie Sanders
 did for 
mittens
.
Soon after a photo emerged on social media, showing the embattled New York Democrat outside his home, wrapped in a blanket – and holding a bottle as he spoke on a cell phone  -- Twitter erupted with commentary and memes.

One Republican state lawmaker in New York – Assembly member Mike Lawler -- compared Cuomo to 
Linus Van Pelt, the blanket-loving character
 from the classic &#34;Peanuts&#34; comic strip.
NEW YORK SENS. SCHUMER, GILLIBRAND CALL FOR GOV. CUOMO&#39;S RESIGNATION
Another Twitter user likened Cuomo to &#34;The Sopranos&#34; character Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli), as he shivered in the mob series’ famous &#34;Pine Barrens&#34; episode, lost in the snow with Paulie &#34;Walnuts&#34; Gualtieri (Tony Sirico).
Some saw a business opportunity.
Retail site RedBubble was offering &#34;I (Heart) Governor Cuomo&#34; blankets for $38.92. The same site also offered throw pillows for $19.32.
One Twitter user was reminded of the forlorn character that comedian Steve Martin played in the 1979 comedy &#34;The Jerk.&#34;
Comedian J-L Cauvin modeled what he called &#34;the Cuomo blanket.&#34;
&#34;As you can see,&#34; he said in a Cuomo voice, &#34;it provides for plenty of ventilation as well as keeping your cold heart warm on those cool nights when you are planning a vicious revenge against the suddenly emboldened progressives who want to take you out.&#34;

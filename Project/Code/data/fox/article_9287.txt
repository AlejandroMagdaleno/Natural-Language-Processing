Former President 
Donald Trump
 returned to the campaign trail in 
Ohio
 on Saturday night to throw his support behind Republican congressional candidate Max Miller in an attempt to oust 
Rep. Anthony Gonzalez
.
In his first major campaign event since leaving office, Trump held a boisterous rally in Wellington, southwest of Cleveland, where he condemned Gonzalez as a &#34;sellout&#34; and a &#34;disgrace.&#34;
TRUMP DEMANDS 100% TARIFFS ON CHINESE GOODS, DEBT CANCELLATION, AND $10T IN REPARATIONS FOR COVID-19
Gonzalez was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over his alleged role in the 
Jan. 6 attack
 on the U.S. Capitol.
&#34;He’s a grandstanding RINO [Republican in name only] – not respected in D.C. – who voted for the unhinged, unconstitutional, illegal impeachment,&#34; Trump told his supporters, again calling it a &#34;witch hunt.&#34;
Trump assured the crowd he wasn’t supporting Miller, his former White House aide, just to spite Gonzalez.
&#34;That’s not the reason I’m doing this,&#34; Trump said.  &#34;But I just thought that it was a character trait that was not so good.&#34;
OHIO GOP CALLS FOR REP. ANTHONY GONZALEZ TO RESIGN OVER IMPEACHMENT VOTE
Miller announced his campaign for Congress after Gonzalez voted to impeach the former president.
&#34;I need all of your help to get RINO, turncoat Tony out of office,&#34; Miller said in reference to a person who has shifted allegiances.
Trump called out other members of the Republican Party he believes betrayed the GOP, including Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah -- both of whom voted for his 
impeachment

President Biden
’s approval 
ratings
 remain healthy five months into his presidency.
But on some important issues, including
 immigration 
and relations with 
China 
and 
Russia,
 the latest 
Fox News poll 
indicates that the president’s approval rating is underwater with voters across the nation.
Biden’s approval rating stands at 53% and his disapproval at 43% in an average of the latest national surveys compiled by 
RealClearPolitics.
 And the president stands at 56%-42% in a
 Fox News Poll
 conducted June 19-22 and released on Wednesday.

Likely fueling Biden’s overall numbers is a 64%-34% approval/disapproval on how he’s been handling the 
coronavirus pandemic
, according to the Fox News poll. And on 
the economy
, he stands at 51%-47%.
But when it comes to immigration, the president’s at 41%-54%. And he’s also in negative territory when it comes to relations with Russia – 42%-52% – and China – 39%-54% – two of the nation’s most powerful global adversaries.

The president’s overall approval is boosted by a 93%-7% approval/disapproval among Democrats and 55%-43% among independents. Most Republicans – 78% – disapprove of the job Biden’s doing in office. But just over one in five – 21% – gave his performance so far a thumbs up, and even 14% of people who said they voted for 
then-President Trump
 last November said they approved of Biden.

So where does Biden stand five months into his presidency compared to his most immediate predecessors in the White House?
Donald Trump was at 40%-54% approval/disapproval in late June of 2017, according to a RealClearPolitics average. Biden’s former boss,
 Barack Obama, 
stood at 59%-34% in late June of 2009, but his approval rating was quickly receding at the time. 
George W. Bush
 was at 52%-37% in June of 2001. Bush’s numbers skyrocketed later that year, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Dov Hikind, Americans Against Antisemitism, says Joe Biden needs to address his meeting with noted Farrakhan follower Jacob Blake Sr.
A 
Georgia
 pastor among the Black faith leaders in the state is urging a boycott of Home Depot for insufficiently pushing back on the state&#39;s recently-enacted voting law has enthusiastically praised Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. 
Farrakhan, a notorious anti-Semite who once 
called Adolf Hitler
 a &#34;very great man,&#34; is &#34;one of the greatest leaders of our people,&#34; according to New Birth Missionary Baptist Church senior pastor Jamal H. Bryant. 
The leader of the DeKalb County-based church is one of the pastors urging a boycott of Home Depot for its apolitical stance on the 
Georgia elections law
, which has been 
the subject
 of widely circulated 
misinformation
 from Democrats and liberal media outlets.  
Bryant voiced his support for the Home Depot boycott in a New York Times article published Tuesday, calling the boycott a &#34;necessary evil.&#34;

&#34;It is unfortunate for those who will be impacted by this, but how many more million will be impacted if they don&#39;t have the right to vote?&#34; Bryant 
told
 the paper. &#34;And so in weighing it out, we understand, tongue in cheek, that this is a necessary evil. But it has to happen in order for the good to happen.&#34;
Bryant, however, has been a vocal supporter of Farrakhan online and in person, even referring to the Nation of Islam minister as &#34;one of the greatest leaders of our people&#34; in an 
interview
 with Farrakhan from 2015.
&#34;We welcome to the Word Network and the entire world, the honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan! We’re honored to have you sir,&#34; Bryant said. &#34;I’m so appreciative to be able to mark in history that I lived in the same chasm of time as one of the greatest leaders of our people.&#34;
CELEBRITIES ONCE LINKED TO LOUIS FARRAKHAN
Additionally, in August 2015, Bryant tweeted out a 
teaser 
of the interview the day it aired and posted pictures of himself with Farrakhan from a meeting with him regarding the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March.
Bryant asked for prayers in another tweet from 2015 where he elaborated that he was &#34;the last speaker of the day before [Louis Farrakhan] gives his address.&#34; In a tweet from 2019, Bryant said that he was &#34;humbled&#34; to be in Farrakhan’s presence during the 2015 interview.
The pastor also retweeted a post praising his &#34;passionate opening and explanation&#34; of the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March that tagged Farrakhan.
Bryant has also shown support for controversial pastor Jeremiah Wright, including a 
tweet 
publicizing a &#34;discussion&#34; about Bryant’s sermon entitled &#34;Jeremiah Wright Wasn’t Wrong.&#34; He also publicized a &#34;state of the black church&#34; event 
featuring 
Wright, who is 
infamous
 for declaring, &#34;not God Bless America, God damn America.&#34;

Wright is the pastor emeritus of the Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, which former President Obama attended.  
Bryant did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.

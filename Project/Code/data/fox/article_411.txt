Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey

&#34;President Biden, if you care about the border, if you care about stopping the cartels who are engaging in all kinds of bad acts...if you want to stop the disaster that&#39;s unfolding here and will only get worse in the coming months, President Biden you should declare a national emergency and deploy the vast powers of your administration to stop what&#39;s happening here,&#34; Ducey said at a press conference at the border near Yuma.

 on Tuesday that he was deploying 250 National Guard members to help deal with the escalating numbers, that has seen record numbers of migrant encounters and overwhelmed local authorities. He was at the border meeting with local law enforcement and border officials about the crisis and related security threats.
The Guard will be involved with installing and maintaining border cameras, collecting data, analyzing imagery for trends in border crossings, and helping with operations at detention centers, Ducey&#39;s office said.
The Biden administration has refused to call the situation a &#34;crisis,&#34; instead calling it a &#34;challenge&#34; and blaming the Trump administration for ending legal asylum pathways. Critics have blamed the Biden administration’s rolling back of Trump-era enforcement and border protections.
Ducey has slammed alleged inaction and a lack of planning from the White House.
‘We are getting whiplash from all the mixed signals you are sending,&#34; he said on Wednesday.

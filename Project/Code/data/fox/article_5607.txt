South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham tackles police reform, Biden&#39;s first 100 days, and a potential &#39;bipartisan compromise&#39; on the infrastructure bill.
Sen. 
Lindsey Graham
, R-S.C., told &#34;Fox News Sunday&#34; that he is &#34;not very impressed&#34; with 
President Biden&#39;s
 first 100 days in office.
&#34;During the campaign, he made us all believe Joe Biden would be the moderate choice. That court-packing was a bonehead idea. All of a sudden we have a commission to change the structure of the Supreme Court. Making D.C. a state, I think that’s a very radical idea that will change the makeup of the United States Senate. AOC said his first 100 days exceeded her expectations. That&#39;s all you need to know,&#34; Graham said on Sunday.
FOX NEWS POLL: THREE TIMES AS MANY SAY BORDER SECURITY WORSE UNDER BIDEN
&#34;I&#39;m not very impressed with the first 100 days,&#34; Graham said.
He also criticized the Biden administration&#39;s foreign policy.

&#34;He&#39;s been a disaster on foreign policy. The border is in chaos, the Iranians are off the map, he&#39;s opening up negotiations with the Iranian regime and they haven&#39;t done a d--- thing to change,&#34; Graham said. &#34;Afghanistan&#39;s going to fall apart. Russia and China are already pushing him around, so I&#39;m very worried.&#34;
Graham&#39;s comments come as 
46% of voters
 say U.S. border security is worse today than it was two years ago, compared with 15% who say it is better, according to the latest 
Fox News survey
. 
Meanwhile, President Biden is scheduled to give his first speech to a joint session of 
Congress
 on Wednesday. Graham&#39;s fellow senator from South Carolina, Tim Scott, 
will deliver
 the Republican response.
Graham criticized Senate Democrats for blocking Scott&#39;s police reform legislation last summer in the wake of George Floyd&#39;s murder.
&#34;We would have police reform in the last Congress, but Chuck Schumer and Kamala Harris made a conscious effort to block bringing up Tim Scott&#39;s reform bill,&#34; Graham said on Sunday. &#34;They filibustered Tim Scott&#39;s bill because they didn&#39;t want Tim Scott and President Trump to get credit for it.&#34;

&#34;Qualified immunity is a big deal. If you want to destroy policing in America, make sure that every cop can be sued when they leave the house,&#34; he said. &#34;There&#39;s a way to find qualified immunity reform. Take the cop out of it. My idea, along with Sen. Scott, is you can&#39;t sue the police officer, you sue the department if there&#39;s an allegation of civil rights abuse or constitutional rights abuse.&#34;
Graham said he and Scott hoped to achieve a bipartisan solution on the issue in May.

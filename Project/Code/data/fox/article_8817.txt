McAllen, Texas Mayor-Elect Javier Villalobos on shooting in Reynosa, Mexico that left 15 innocent bystanders killed.
A trio of lawmakers from Texas called on 
President Biden
 
and 
Vice President Harris
 to travel to the 
Lone Star State
 and visit the 
southern 
border
 amid the ongoing crisis.
Republican Sen. John Cornyn, Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales and Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar coauthored an opinion piece in the Dallas Morning News on Tuesday, noting that 
border apprehensions
 have skyrocketed during the Biden administration. 
The lawmakers pointed out that the U.S. is on track to receive &#34;the highest number of total yearly border crossings in two decades&#34; after nearly 930,000 migrants including &#34;almost 80,000 unaccompanied children&#34; have illegally crossed over into America in the past 8 months.
KAMALA HARRIS HAS GONE 90 DAYS WITHOUT VISIT TO BORDER SINCE BEING TAPPED FOR CRISIS ROLE
&#34;The momentum for this crisis has been building for months, but no significant action has been taken to address it.&#34; the lawmakers 
wrote
. &#34;The president and vice president have yet to even visit the border.&#34;
The Texans lambasted Harris for saying &#34;she is interested in doing work that leads to real results as opposed to ‘grand gestures,’&#34; writing they shared the same interests.
&#34;We agree, which is why we&#39;ve spent significant time meeting with officials in Texas who are on the front lines of this humanitarian crisis,&#34; they wrote, adding they’ve seen the effects of the cartels and criminal organizations abusing the U.S. immigration system.
They also highlighted their work with Cornyn’s fellow senator, Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., on bipartisan legislation armed with the &#34;feedback&#34; of &#34;law enforcement, nongovernmental organizations, and community leaders who are expected to make up for the failures of the federal government&#34; at the border.

The lawmakers also warned that without a &#34;transition plan, the administration will invite a complete and immediate overload of the system,&#34; noting that &#34;Border Patrol agents are already spread thin&#34; due to the border crisis.
&#34;They lack the facilities and resources to fairly and humanely process the current influx of migrants, let alone many tens of thousands more every month,&#34; the Texans wrote. &#34;As the administration considers the best path forward, there has never been a more important time to hear from the men and women who live and work in border communities and have for decades.&#34;

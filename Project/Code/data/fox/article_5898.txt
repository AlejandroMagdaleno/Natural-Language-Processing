Fox Nation&#39;s &#39;Get Tammy Bruce&#39; host gives her take on the Democrat&#39;s message to protesters in Minnesota.
Powerful companies and groups, including Boeing, the National Association of Realtors and General Motors, that have donated to Rep. 
Maxine Waters
, D-Calif., have been silent after urging protesters in Brooklyn Center, Minn., to &#34;get more confrontational&#34; if Derek Chauvin isn&#39;t convicted of murdering 
George Floyd
.
&#34;We&#39;ve got to stay on the street and we&#39;ve got to get more active, we&#39;ve got to get more confrontational. We&#39;ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business,&#34; Waters said Saturday, adding she was &#34;hopeful&#34; Chauvin would be convicted of murder.
The jury on Tuesday found Chauvin guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter
WATERS BRUSHES OFF JUDGE’S CRITICISM OVER ‘CONFRONTATIONAL’ COMMENT
Judge Peter Cahill, who is presiding over Chauvin&#39;s trial, 
called
 Waters&#39; comments &#34;disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch.&#34;
Influential corporations and groups including the Service Employees International Union, Deloitte, the Credit Union National Association and BlackRock have 
donated
 to Waters in the past. Fox News&#39; inquiries to the organizations were not returned at the time of publication, except for GM, which pointed Fox News to CEO Mary Barra&#39;s 
tweets
 about the Chauvin verdict but did not address Waters&#39; comments.

Cahill was asked by Eric Nelson, Chauvin&#39;s defense attorney, to declare a mistrial due to prosecutorial misconduct and Waters’ comments at a Brooklyn Center protest Saturday night.
Nelson told the court there is a &#34;high probability&#34; that jurors will see Waters’ comments. Cahill denied the request.
&#34;I&#39;ll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned,&#34; Cahill said.
Cahill called it &#34;disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch&#34; for elected officials to comment on the outcome of the case.
&#34;Their failure to do so, I think, is abhorrent, he said. &#34;But I don’t think it has prejudiced us with additional material that would prejudice this jury. They have been told not to watch the news. I trust they are following those instructions.&#34;

Waters has a history of in-your-face remarks and impassioned statements.
In 2018, she called for her supporters to &#34;create a crowd&#34; and to &#34;push back&#34; on members of the Trump administration in public.
&#34;Let&#39;s make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd,&#34; Waters said. &#34;And you push back on them. And you tell them they&#39;re not welcome anymore, anywhere.&#34;

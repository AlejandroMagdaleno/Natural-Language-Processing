White House
 press secretary Jen Psaki was grilled about 
President Biden
 joking in response to a question about the crisis in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Biden was asked by a reporter what he will do if Americans remain in Afghanistan after the Aug. 31 deadline, prompting the president to quip: &#34;You’ll be the first person I call.&#34; 
WHITE HOUSE IN CHAOS STRUGGLES TO KEEP BIDEN ON TIME
Fox News&#39; Peter Doocy pressed Psaki on Biden&#39;s 
response
 to the reporter&#39;s question, asking her: &#34;What&#39;s so funny?&#34; 
Psaki appeared to be caught off-guard by the question, focusing her answer instead on the administration&#39;s talking points about the ongoing evacuation. 
&#34;I think what he conveyed is that he has not — well, what I can convey from here, I should say is that, as he stated yesterday and as the secretary of state just stated, we&#39;re on track to complete our mission by August 31st,&#34; Psaki responded.
&#34;Obviously there are discussions, and the president received a briefing just this morning — as I noted, he asked yesterday for contingency plans and he received a briefing on them this morning, &#34; Psaki continued. &#34;These are incredibly serious issues and they are discussions that are happening internally.&#34;

Psaki said that in &#34;addition to the contingency plans&#34; Biden asked for, the pullout plan is &#34;contingent on us achieving our objectives and the continued coordination with the Taliban.&#34;
The president’s spokeswoman also said that Biden has spoken on the issue &#34;multiple times over the last several days&#34; and &#34;also highlighted the fact&#34; that the administration is monitoring &#34;the threats from ISISK.&#34;

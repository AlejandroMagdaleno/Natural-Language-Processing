Fox News correspondent Alicia Acuna has the latest developments from Boulder, Colorado
Rep. Lauren Boebert
, R-Colo., accused 
President Biden
 on Tuesday of &#34;politicizing&#34; the mass shooting at a Boulder, Colorado grocery store that left 10 people dead after he called for a nationwide ban on assault weapons.
Biden urged Congress to pass several gun control measures, including a ban on assault weapons, a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines and tighter background check requirements, following the nation’s second mass shooting in a week. Boebert, an outspoken gun rights advocate, argued that Biden’s proposals were at odds with the second amendment.
&#34;Joe Biden has wasted no time politicizing the attack in Boulder yesterday by calling for an assault weapons ban &amp; other infringements on our Second Amendment,&#34; Boebert said.
BIDEN CONSIDERING EXECUTIVE ACTION ON GUN CONTROL, PSAKI SAYS
Boebert is a first-term congresswoman from Colorado’s 3rd congressional district, which does not include Boulder. She drew scrutiny in recent months after she pledged to carry a firearm on the House floor. In February, Democratic lawmakers criticized Boebert after she displayed multiple long guns in the background during a virtual House committee hearing.
Senate lawmakers held a hearing to debate potential measures to prevent further gun violence on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after the Boulder shooting.  
&#34;It should not be a partisan issue,&#34; Biden said. &#34;This is an American issue. It will save lives, American lives.&#34;
With the Senate divided 50-50, Democrats would face an uphill battle to pass comprehensive gun control legislation such as a ban on assault weapons. When asked about potential measures to pursue tighter gun laws, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki did not rule out the possibility of executive action.
&#34;We are considering a range of levers, including working through legislation, including executive action,&#34; Psaki told reporters. &#34;That has been under discussion and will continue to be under discussion.&#34; 
Police arrested Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, a 21-year-old Colorado resident, in connection with the Boulder shooting. Authorities said Alissa purchased a Ruger AR-556 rifle just days before the shooting. He was charged with 10 counts of first-degree.

In a statement earlier Tuesday, Boebert expressed condolences to the families of the shooting’s victims. At the same time, she ripped lawmakers pushing for tighter gun laws.
&#34;While some elected officials have already started using this shooting to advance a political agenda, I refuse to do so,&#34; Boebert said. &#34;I will not blame society at large for the sick actions of one man and I will not allow lawbreakers to dictate the rights of law-abiding citizens.&#34;

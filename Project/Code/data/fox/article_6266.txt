Minnesota
 Republicans slammed Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, for seeming to condemn 
law enforcement
 for the death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright before the authorities finish their investigation.
&#34;I am closely monitoring the situation in Brooklyn Center. Gwen and I are praying for Daunte Wright’s family as our state mourns another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement,&#34; Walz wrote on 
Twitter
 on Sunday night.
The Minnesota GOP accused Walz of &#34;perpetuating a narrative of an unknown situation.&#34;
&#34;A Governor&#39;s responsibility is minimize turmoil, not fan the flames in challenging times,&#34; the Minnesota GOP said in a statement to Fox News. &#34;We pray for the family and friends of Daunte Wright, and hope for a expediency in the investigation process. For a Governor to lead by casting blame and perpetuating a narrative of an unknown situation is not only irresponsible, it&#39;s conduct unbecoming a Governor. We call on Governor Tim Walz to censure himself if he is not able to practice the discipline needed to lead our state in a way that helps us move forward together.&#34;
LOOTING IN MINNEAPOLIS, NATIONAL GUARD ACTIVATED AFTER POLICE SHOOTING OF DAUNTE WRIGHT
&#34;Governor, your words fuel fire for protesters. You of all people should know to wait until the [Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension] finish their investigation. In your tweet, you should have stopped after the words, &#39;praying for Duante [sic] Wright’s family.&#39; Everything after that was inappropriate,&#34; Saint Paul Republicans wrote on 
Twitter
.
Minneapolis
 erupted in looting and riots late Sunday after Wright was shot by a law enforcement officer during a traffic stop in Brooklyn Center, Minn., just 10 miles from where Derek Chauvin had 
George Floyd
 pinned to the pavement last May.
Brooklyn Center Police did not immediately identify Wright or disclose his race. In a statement, Brooklyn Center Police said that officers stopped an individual shortly before 2 p.m. Sunday. After determining the driver had an outstanding warrant, police tried to arrest him. But the driver reentered the vehicle and drove away, police said. An officer fired at the vehicle, striking the driver. Police said the vehicle traveled several blocks before crashing into another vehicle. A female passenger sustained nonlife-threatening injuries.

&#34;Our entire community is filled with grief following today’s officer-involved shooting of Daunte Wright, a 20 year old young man. Our hearts are with his family, and with all those in our community impacted by this tragedy,&#34; Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott said on Monday. &#34;While we await additional information from the BCA [Bureau of Criminal Apprehension] who is leading the investigation, we continue to ask that members of our community gathering do so peacefully, amid our calls for transparency and accountability.&#34;
Tensions are high in the region as the trial for Chauvin, the former Minneapolis officer charged in Floyd’s death, continues into its third week on Monday in Minneapolis. Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said more National Guard members would be deployed around the city of Minneapolis and in Brooklyn Center.

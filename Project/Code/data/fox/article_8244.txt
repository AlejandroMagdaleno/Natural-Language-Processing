U.S. Sen. 
Ted Cruz
 doubled down on his response to former House Speaker 
John Boehner
 after he told the Texas Republican to &#34;go f--- yourself&#34; in a leaked audio recording.
&#34;I think he was probably recording at nine or ten in the morning so obviously he had too much wine that day already,&#34; Cruz told the Daily Caller on Saturday. &#34;This guy is a little unhinged.&#34;
BOEHNER TELLS CRUZ TO &#39;GO F--- YOURSELF&#39; WHILE RECORDING AUDIO BOOK: REPORT
Cruz on Friday 
mockingly 
tweeted that he wears 
Boehner
’s &#34;drunken, bloviated scorn&#34; proudly alongside a clip from an upcoming CBS News interview with Boehner in which he calls Cruz a &#34;jerk&#34; and accuses him of &#34;making a lot of noise&#34; but not being especially productive in Congress.
&#34;The Swamp is unhappy,&#34; Cruz tweeted. &#34;I wear with pride his drunken, bloviated scorn. Please don’t cry,&#34; the lawmaker joked, referencing Boehner&#39;s reputation for appearing publicly emotional at various points throughout his career. 
The ex-speaker has taken several shots at Cruz, including while recording his audiobook when he reportedly 
told Cruz to &#34;f---&#34; himself 
in several off-script moments.
In the CBS interview, Boehner says he doesn’t like to &#34;beat anyone up&#34; but he’d make an exception for Cruz.
&#34;Perfect symbol, you know, of getting elected, making a lot of noise, draw a lot of attention to yourself, raise a lot of money, which means you’re gonna go make more noise, raise more money,&#34; Boehner told CBS of how he views Cruz’s political career.  
Boehner, an Ohio Republican who served as House speaker from 2011-2015, has been making the interview rounds promoting his 
book, 
&#34;On The House: A Washington Memoir,&#34; which comes out next week. Boehner represented Ohio&#39;s 8th Congressional District from 1991-2015.

Cruz made a joke of it at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Florida in February, saying, &#34;John Boehner made some news. He suggested that I do something that was anatomically impossible. To which my response was, &#39;Who’s John Boehner?&#39;&#34; according to 
The Hill.
 
Cruz on Saturday noted that the &#34;lead insult on the back on the back of the book is a different insult he directed at me.&#34;
&#34;He seems to have a bit of an obsession,&#34; Cruz said.
Asked whether he planned to write a book about Boehner in response, Cruz said plainly, &#34;I don&#39;t anticipate writing a fortune cookie about him.&#34;

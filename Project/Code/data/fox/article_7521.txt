Kentucky Republican reacts to the NIAID director calling for vaccinated people to wear masks on &#39;The Story&#39;
If 
President Biden
 wants to motivate more Americans to get vaccinated against the 
coronavirus
, he should &#34;go on national TV, take his mask off and burn it,&#34; Sen. 
Rand Paul
, R-Ky., told &#34;
The Story
&#34; Wednesday.
&#34;[Biden should] light a torch to it and burn his mask and say, ‘I’ve had the vaccine. I am now safe from this plague. If you’ll get the vaccine you can be safe too,’&#34; Paul told host Martha MacCallum. &#34;The burden of proof should be on the government to prove we’re spreading it. [If we are.] then we’ll listen to them. Instead it sounds like fear-mongering.&#34;
Paul also continued his criticism of White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci for insisting that vaccinated Americans continue to wear massk to avoid inadvertently infecting vulnerable people.
&#34;The science is about proving that things are happening,&#34; he said. &#34;If Dr. Fauci can prove that people who are vaccinated are spreading the disease, I will listen to him. If he can prove people like me, who have already had it [COVID-19], are spreading the disease, I’ll listen to him. But there is no evidence of that.&#34;
BIDEN GOAL OF 200 MILLION COVID-19 VACCINES TO BE REACHED THURSDAY
Host Martha MacCallum responded by noting that an estimated 6,000 people out of 63 million had contracted COVID-19 after they were vaccinated.
Paul agreed that there is a &#34;very small&#34; occurrence of so-called &#34;breakthrough&#34; infections, but pointed out there were &#34;virtually zero hospitalizations and virtually zero deaths&#34; from COVID-19 among people who had received the vaccine.

&#34;Most people get a mild course of it, and there’s a rare, if ever, reinfection that caused a fatality,&#34; he said. &#34;So we should appreciate immunity, both naturally acquired and by vaccine. 
You know why people don’t trust the government?&#34; Paul added. &#34;Because they say everybody is the same. Whether or not you’ve had the disease or not, you have to be vaccinated. It’s this one-size-fits-all that people know this is not dangerous for young people, but very dangerous after a certain age and for overweight people.&#34;

Florida governor commends the quick actions of rescue workers responding to the disaster on &#39;Hannity&#39;
President Biden on Friday ordered federal assistance to support the massive response in South Florida after a 12-story building partially collapsed, killing at least one person and trapping others.
&#34;The President&#39;s action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts,&#39;&#39; the White House said.
About 100 people are still unaccounted for, authorities said. A search-and-rescue effort is underway.
FEMA said in a statement that the assistance is intended to alleviate some of the strain on local and state emergency crews that are working around the clock to rescue those trapped.

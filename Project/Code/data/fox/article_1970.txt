Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., on surge of migrants at the border, origins of COVID-19.
The migrant crisis at the 
U.S. southern border
 could be fixed in a week if 
President Biden
 returns to the Trump-era 
immigration
 policies that he has rolled back since taking office in January, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said Sunday.
Kennedy, who sits on the Senate Judiciary and Budget Committees, told &#34;
Sunday Morning Futures
&#34; anchor Maria Bartiromo that all Biden must do to &#34;stem the tide&#34; of the migrant surge is to &#34;listen to the Border Patrol agents and go back to doing what we were doing in December&#34; before he took office.
BIDEN STAFFER BLOCKS TED CRUZ FROM TAKING VIDEO AT MIGRANT FACILITY
&#34;All we have to do is go back to what we were doing before ... President Biden undid everything that the Republican Congress and the Trump administration did,&#34; Kennedy said. &#34;It&#39;ll be fixed in a week.&#34;
Migrants have surged the U.S. southern border in recent weeks after Biden rolled back some of former President Trump’s measures, an act interpreted by some as a signal to travel to the U.S.
Biden&#39;s administration has come under fire over the conditions in which the overflow of migrants are being kept, and for heavily restricting media access into the facilities.

Texas governor lays out the state&#39;s plan to manage the surge in migration and alien crime.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s
 effort to build a 
wall at Texas’ southern border
 has raised almost $400,000 in public donations since the project was announced last week, the governor’s office confirmed to Fox News on Tuesday.

More than 450 miles of border wall, including in Texas, was built during the Trump administration. That construction was

On Wednesday, Abbott said that the Biden administration &#34;has abandoned its responsibility to apply federal law to secure the border and enforce the immigration laws.&#34;

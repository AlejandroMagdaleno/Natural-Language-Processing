Sen. 
Amy Klobuchar
 has urged 
Supreme Court
 
Justice
 Stephen Breyer to retire &#34;sooner rather than later&#34; if he’s considering retirement at all. 
Democrats
 have increasingly called for Breyer to step down after the 
late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
’s spot on the bench was filled by a Trump appointee. Some lawmakers on the left have even touted the idea of expanding the number of justices as they fear the Court tilting further to the right.

&#34;But if he’s going to retire, it should be sooner rather than later.&#34;
AOC AGREES WITH CALLS FOR BREYER TO STEP DOWN FROM SUPREME COURT
Justices serve lifetime appointments, but some justices have opted for retirement. Justice Anthony Kennedy stepped down in 2018, allowing then-President Trump to choose Justice Brett Kavanaugh as his replacement. 
If Republicans retake control of the Senate in 2022, it puts Breyer’s seat at risk as the Republicans have shown a willingness to roadblock appointments.

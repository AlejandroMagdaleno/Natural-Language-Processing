Retired Rockwall County Sheriff Harold Eavenson says the Biden administration is &#39;basically reopening the border&#39; to illegal immigrants.
The 
Biden
 administration&#39;s immigration policies amount to &#34;reopening the border&#34; to illegal aliens and creating the conditions for an 
illegal immigration
 spike, a retired 
Texas
 sheriff warned on 
&#34;Fox &amp; Friends&#34;
 Tuesday.
&#34;We do not have the infrastructure in place to take care of those thousands and thousands of people that want to come here,&#34; former Rockwall County Sheriff Harold Eavenson told co-host 
Ainsley Earhardt.
 &#34;And some of them have criminal histories and they bring that with them into our country as well.&#34;
Eavenson asserted that the federal government has a duty to provide security for its citizens by enforcing immigration law.
He added that the United States is &#34;gullible&#34; for taking in immigrants that their own countries do not want to be responsible for and buying into the &#34;philosophy&#34; of prioritizing immigrants over the safety of citizens. 
REPUBLICANS SLAM BIDEN MOVE TO ADMIT 25,000 MIGRANTS FROM MEXICO AMID BORDER SURGE FEARS
&#34;We must build that wall and we must enforce our immigration laws&#34; he added. 
Biden’s immigration agenda, which was recently suspended by a federal judge, makes a number of changes to former President Donald Trump’s approach to immigration. 
Biden’s immigration orders include halting deportations for at least 100 days, ending the &#34;Remain in Mexico&#34; policy, resuming catch and release, and ending border wall construction.
Over the weekend, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis slammed the president&#39;s reported consideration of domestic travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic even as the administration seeks to loosen immigration restrictions.
&#34;You can&#39;t square wanting open borders for illegal aliens, but then also restricting U.S. citizens from basically traveling around the country as they see fit and I think the American people see the hypocrisy in that,&#34; DeSantis told &#34;Sunday Morning Futures.&#34;

The New York Times reported
 earlier this month that health authorities in San Diego have ruled that those crossing into 
California
 must stay in a hotel for 10 days before being allowed to continue their travels in the United States.  
However, the Times also reported, citing volunteers working with migrants in 
Texas
, that &#34;there is no similar quarantine requirement&#34; for migrants who arrive in that state with no coronavirus symptoms.

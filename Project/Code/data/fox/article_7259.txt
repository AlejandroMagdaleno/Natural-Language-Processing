Sam Adams, the former mayor of 
Portland, Ore
., who was ensnared in a sex scandal while in office, may return to serve in Mayor Ted Wheeler&#39;s administration, according to media reports. 
It was unclear what role Adams would take on.

Oregonian
. Messages to Adams and Wheeler&#39;s office were not immediately returned. 
Wheeler’s current chief of staff, Kristen Dennis, is leaving to become the chief of staff to Metro Council President Lynn Peterson. 
Adams, 57, took office in 2009 after serving as the chief of staff for late Mayor Vera Katz for nearly three terms and serving on the City Council. His tenure in office was marred by a scandal involving an alleged sexual relationship with a young man that started when he was a teenager. 
Prosecutors investigated claims that the relationship began before the man, Beau Breedlove, turned 18, the newspaper reported. No charges were brought against Adams.

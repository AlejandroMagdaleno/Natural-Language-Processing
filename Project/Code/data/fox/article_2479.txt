Former President Bill Clinton shared a video update on his condition on Wednesday after he was 
released
 this week from a Southern California hospital where he successfully battled an infection.
&#34;I&#39;m really glad to be back home,&#34; said 75-year-old Clinton in a video shared to Twitter. 
He offered appreciation for the doctors and nurses at the University of 
California
 Irvine Medical Center for the &#34;absolutely wonderful care&#34; they provided to him during his stay.

&#34;I&#39;m doing great, enjoying this beautiful fall weather,&#34; Clinton added, noting that he is &#34;on the road to recovery&#34; after spending six days in the hospital.
&#34;I want to remind everyone out there: Take the time to listen to your bodies and care for yourselves,&#34; he said. &#34;We all have work to do, and each of us has an important role to play in life and the immediate future.&#34;

Clinton also said he is going to do his &#34;best to be around to keep doing the most good&#34; he can for &#34;a lot longer.&#34;
An aide to the former president told the Associated Press that Clinton had a urological infection that spread to his bloodstream, and that he was in an intensive care section of the hospital but wasn’t receiving ICU care.

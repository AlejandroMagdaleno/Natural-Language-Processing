Former House Speaker John Boehner calls President Biden&#39;s infrastructure plan a &#39;new word for the Green New Deal&#39; on &#39;Fox &amp;amp; Friends.&#39;
Former Republican 
House
 speaker and author of the new book &#34;On the House&#34; John Boehner told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
&#34; Tuesday that 
President Biden
&#39;s 
infrastructure
 plan is another example of the president catering to far-left progressives at the expense of bipartisanship.
REPUBLICANS SENATORS LINE UP AGAINST BIDEN&#39;S MASSIVE $2T SPENDING BILL: &#39;FAR CRY&#39; FROM INFRASTRUCTURE
JOHN BOEHNER: Well this is apparently a new word for the Green New Deal, because if you look at the bill that they have put forward, it covers everything that the far-left has ever wanted. Listen, if we&#39;re going to do infrastructure, why don&#39;t we talk about traditional infrastructure: roads, bridges, dams, locks, transit systems? Those are the things that were typically in an infrastructure bill.
…
What we haven&#39;t seen a whole lot written about is this giant schism in the Democrat Party, that Joe Biden being a traditional Democrat, he&#39;s got these far-left wing progressives that he has catered to ever since he was sworn in and at the expense, frankly, of working in a bipartisan manner. But this little fight between the traditional Democrats and the far-left is about to come into full view for all Americans, because when it comes to this infrastructure bill and the so-called pay force -- increasing taxes -- they&#39;re going to have a long road to hoe because what Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren want is not what Joe Manchin and the Democrat senators from Arizona want. 
And it&#39;s going to be interesting to see this play out. Frankly, I think you have the same problem in the House. Speaker Pelosi has a very narrow majority now, and they&#39;re going to have their challenges as well.

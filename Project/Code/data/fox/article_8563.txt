Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., calls for Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign following sexual harassment investigation
Rep. Elise Stefanik
 slammed a local news outlet for its coverage of her, stating that commentary by two male journalists on her role as a working mother and GOP leader is &#34;outrageously sexist.&#34;
&#34;Wow,&#34; the New York Republican tweeted Friday. &#34;It’s 2021. This is a real TV clip aired in
 #NY21
 this evening. A local news station (

 ) thinks it’s appropriate for two male &#34;journalists / analysts&#34; to question whether a pregnant woman or new mother can effectively legislate in elected office.&#34;
ELISE STEFANIK CALLS LIZ CHENEY A &#39;PELOSI PAWN&#39;
In the story, reporter WCAX3 Darren Perron writes, &#34;New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who has become a standard-bearer for the Trump wing of the GOP, is expecting her first child later this Fall. How will that impact her role in representing New York’s 21st District?&#34;
In a clip, Perron speaks with SUNY Plattsburgh Political scientist Harvey Schantz about how her absence during pregnancy could potentially &#34;hurt her role&#34; in the Republican Party.
Stefanik called some of the quotes from the clip &#34;outrageously sexist.&#34;

Stefanik’s Republican colleague from Iowa, Rep. Ashley Hinson, also took issue with the news segment calling it &#34;absurd.&#34;
&#34;It’s absurd that Elise has to deal with this,&#34; Hinson tweeted. &#34;Elise continues to show women that they can run, win, and do the job better than anyone as a working mom.&#34;

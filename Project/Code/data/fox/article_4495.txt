Missouri Republican senator discusses his plan to bring jobs back to working people on &#39;FOX News Primetime&#39;
Democrats&#39; disastrous trade and 
economic policies
 &#34;have made American workers compete with the slave labor,&#34; Sen. 
Josh Hawley
, R-Mo., told &#34;
Fox News Primetime
&#34; Friday.
&#34;Working folks, communities have suffered as the jobs are shipped off to China and shipped overseas to the lowest bidder,&#34; Hawley told host Lawrence Jones before claiming Democrats have allowed that to happen &#34;in order to get rich.&#34; 
The time has come, Hawley continued, to &#34;bring those jobs back to create opportunities in our urban core and rural areas for American workers.&#34; 
Turning to the topic of the Republican Party&#39;s future, Hawley said the GOP has to be &#34;the party of the working people in this nation. 
HAWLEY SLAMS &#39;MR. UNITY&#39; BIDEN FOR CRITICISM OF RED STATES&#39; &#39;NEANDERTHAL THINKING&#39;
&#34;Look at how Donald Trump grew the party and made it the most racially diverse in [terms of] numbers of votes. How did he do it? He focused on the concerns of the working people,&#34; he added. &#34;We have to be the party of working folks and be the party to get jobs back, of new opportunities.&#34;
Hawley went on to stress the importance of getting workers job and skills training without having to pay for an expensive four-year college education they don’t want.
&#34;If we are not the party of working people, we won&#39;t have a future as a party. That is what Donald Trump shown us and that is path forward,&#34; Hawley said.

The senator reiterated that he has no intention of seeking the Republican nomination in 2024. 
&#34;My job is to serve the people of Missouri. We&#39;re a diverse state with working folk of all racial backgrounds,&#34; he said. &#34;We need policies to bring jobs back to this country. Immigration is another one. We need to quit prioritizing illegal immigrants over American workers. We need a pro-job, pro-worker policy in this country.

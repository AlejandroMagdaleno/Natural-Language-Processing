House GOP leadership discusses growth and the future of the party on &#39;Hannity&#39;
House
 Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik joined former President Trump in endorsing 
Ohio
 congressional candidate Mike Carey Tuesday, saying he will be &#34;a strong ally in our fight to keep America safe, prosperous and free,&#34; while establishment Republicans have thrown their support behind other candidates in the highly contested primary race next month.
&#34;To defeat the socialist Democrat agenda and fire Nancy Pelosi in 2022, we need more proven conservative fighters in the House Republican Conference, which is why I proudly stand with President Trump in endorsing Mike Carey for Congress,&#34; Stefanik, R-N.Y., said. 
&#34;I look forward to working closely with Mike, as he will be a strong ally in our fight to keep America safe, prosperous and free.&#34;
Carey, who is running for the Republican nomination in Ohio’s 15th Congressional District, said he was &#34;truly humbled&#34; to receive Stefanik’s endorsement, adding he &#34;appreciate[s] everything she has already done to empower our party.&#34; 
&#34;She is a force within the conservative movement and I can’t wait to join her fight to push Nancy Pelosi and the radical Democrats out of power,&#34; Carey said Tuesday. 
Carey was endorsed by Trump, and describes himself as a &#34;conservative outsider,&#34; saying he stood with the former president &#34;when he took on the political establishment.&#34; 
Carey is just one in a crowded field of 11 candidates vying for the Republican nomination in the 15th District to replace former U.S. Rep. Steve Stivers, who retired from Congress in May.

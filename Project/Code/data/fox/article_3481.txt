Dan Patrick, Texas Lieutenant governor, argues the left has already &#39;handcuffed&#39; itself by not allowing ICE and Border Patrol to do their jobs.
Senate Majority Whip 
Dick Durbin
, D-Ill., is unhappy with the Biden administration following the release of a quarterly report of statistics related to applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (
DACA
) program.
According to the 
report
, the administration has approved just 763 initial DACA applications since January, with more than 55,000 applications still pending. This is in addition to more than 44,000 pending renewal applications.
HARRIS PUSHES AMNESTY BILLS ON DACA ANNIVERSARY, AS REPUBLICANS SLAM BORDER CRISIS RESPONSE

This is not the first time Durbin, lead author of the DREAM Act that would codify DACA, has chastised the Biden administration for its lack of action. Earlier this month, he and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., led 19 other Senate Democrats in calling for the administration to act faster.

That letter was sent on June 15, the ninth anniversary of DACA. That same day, protesters in Washington, D.C., called for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and slammed the administration for not acting.

&#34;President Biden promised to take action within the first 100 days of being elected,&#34; a rally leader said. &#34;What a change of tone, right? When it was just [this] past week when we heard Vice President Kamala Harris say, ‘Do not come. Do not come.’&#34;

Eric Adam secured his place as the Democratic candidate in the race for 
New York City mayor
 Tuesday, winning the 
Democratic primary.
Adams -- who if elected would only be the second Black mayor of the Big Apple -- beat out presidential hopeful turned-mayoral candidate Andrew Yang, Maya Wiley, who was endorsed by New York Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and top contender Kathryn Garcia.
The Associated Press declared Adams the winner early Tuesday evening based on the latest tabulations, which included most absentee ballots.

&#34;If Black lives really matter, it can&#39;t only be against police abuse,&#34; Adams told his supporters the night of the primary race. &#34;It has to be against the violence that&#39;s ripping apart our communities.&#34;

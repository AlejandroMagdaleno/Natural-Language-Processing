President-elect Biden’s
 nominee for
 secretary of state
, Antony Blinken, said in a confirmation hearing Tuesday there is &#34;no doubt&#34; China poses the greatest threat of any nation to the U.S.  and the Trump administration was right to take a tougher stance against the Asian power. 
&#34;President Trump was right in taking a tougher approach to China,&#34; said Blinken, who served as then-Vice President Biden’s national security advisor before being elevated to deputy secretary of state under Barack Obama. &#34;Not the way he went about it in a number of ways, but the basic principle was right.&#34; 
Blinken said he would prefer to lead from a &#34;position of strength,&#34; working with allies and leading international institutions. 
&#34;No party has a monopoly on good ideas. I hope we can work together and pool ideas,&#34; the nominee said. 
Blinken&#39;s tough stance on China came just as his predecessor, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, accused China of state-sponsored genocide of the Uighur people in the Xinjiang Province. 
On the genocide designation, Blinken said: &#34;That would be my judgment as well.&#34; The U.S. is now the first state to accuse China of genocide.

Blinken also praised the Trump administration’s Abraham Accords, U.S.-brokered peace deals between Israel and several Arab nations. He applauded the administration’s work to broker a deal between Kosovo and Serbia and to pressure NATO allies to invest more. 
Blinken said that China was now openly seeking hegemony throughout the world. &#34;The hiding and biding has gone away and they are much more assertive in making clear that they seek to become in effect, the leading country in the world.&#34;

The nominee expressed optimism that the U.S. could stave off China’s encroachment. &#34;We can outcompete China—and remind the world that a government of the people, for the people, can deliver for its people,&#34; Blinken said.

He also said the U.S. is committed to ensuring Taiwan can defend itself against China. &#34;The commitment to Taiwan is something that we hold to very strongly.&#34;

WHAT IS JUNETEENTH? THE HISTORY BEHIND THE OLDEST COMMEMORATION OF THE ABOLISHMENT OF SLAVERY IN THE US
The legislation, which passed the Senate earlier this week, will head to President Biden’s desk for his expected signature.
Juneteenth celebrates June 19, 1865, which was when the last slaves in the U.S. learned they were free following the Civil War. Federal troops arrived in Texas on the date to ensure that slaves were given their freedom. 
President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation more than two years earlier in 1863.

Florida Republican joins &#39;The Story&#39; to discuss controversies surrounding Reps. Liz Cheney and Marjorie Taylor Greene
The 
Wyoming
 state Republican Party formally censured 
Rep. Liz Cheney
 on Saturday, for her Jan. 13 vote to 
impeach President Trump
 for &#34;incitement of insurrection&#34; one week after the Capitol riot.
With only a handful of votes against the censure motion, which passed 59-7, Wyoming’s Republicans  called on Cheney to &#34;immediately&#34; resign and vowed to withhold &#34;future political funding&#34; from her. 
The censure has called on Cheney to appear in front of the state&#39;s GOP for acting &#34;in contradiction to the quantifiable will of the majority of the electorate of Wyoming.&#34;

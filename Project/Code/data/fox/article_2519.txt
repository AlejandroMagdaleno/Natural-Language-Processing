Love of music
Rice’s first name derives from the musical term &#34;con dolcezza,&#34; which in Italian means to play with sweetness.
She became an accomplished pianist at a young age. At age 15 she performed Mozart’s Piano Concerto in D minor with the Denver Symphony Orchestra.
While serving in the Bush administration, Rice played the piano in public on multiple occasions.

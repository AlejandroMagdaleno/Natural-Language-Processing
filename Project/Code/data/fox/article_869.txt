migrant children
 who are found crossing the U.S. 
southern border

PHOTOS OF CROWDED MIGRANT HOLDING CENTER IN TEXAS RELEASED BY DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN
In a statement accompanying the photos, the CBP said it is working to &#34;balance the need for public transparency and accountability.&#34;
&#34;CBP continues to transfer unaccompanied minors to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as quickly and efficiently as possible after they are apprehended on the Southwest Border,&#34; CBP said in a statement Tuesday. 
The agency continued: &#34;In order to protect the health and safety of our workforce and those in our care we continue to discourage external visitors in our facilities; however, CBP is working to balance the need for public transparency and accountability. Still imagery and video are now available of the Donna Processing Center in Donna, Texas, and the Central Processing Center in El Paso, Texas.&#34;
The photos released by CBP also show a line of port-a-potties apparently being used as restroom facilities for the children, as well as an artificial grass field with a few hula hoops presumably as a play area.

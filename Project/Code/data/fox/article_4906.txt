The &#39;Special Report&#39; All-Star Panel discuss the rationale over the president&#39;s attack on Iranian militias
Rep. 
Ilhan Omar
, D-Minn., said Friday she was concerned about the 
White House
’s &#34;legal rationale&#34; for launching 
airstrikes
 in 
Syria
 a day earlier without congressional approval.
&#34;We in Congress have congressional oversight in engaging in war and we haven’t been briefed yet and we have not authorized war in Syria,&#34; Omar told CNN.
Omar had retweeted a resurfaced 2017 post from now-White House press secretary Jen Psaki that had questioned the Trump administration’s &#34;legal authority&#34; for conducting airstrikes against the &#34;sovereign&#34; country at the time.

&#34;Great question,&#34; Omar responded to the four-year-old tweet in light of the Biden administration’s military action announced Thursday.
&#34;Her question was important when it was a different administration and that question still remains with this administration,&#34; Omar told CNN&#39;s John King. &#34;Our ability to engage in constitutional actions does not diminish when the party in power is ours.&#34;

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle criticized the strike, including Republican Reps. Nancy Mace, R-S.C.; Jim Banks, R-Ind.; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; and Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.; and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.; and Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.; and Tim  Kaine, D-Va.
&#34;While the President has a responsibility to defend the people of the United States, our Constitution is clear that it is the Congress, not the President, who has the authority to declare war,&#34; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a statement Friday, adding in a tweet he was &#34;very concerned by last night’s strike by U.S. forces in Syria.&#34;

The first known military action of the Biden administration was meant as a defensive &#34;shot across the bow&#34; against an Iranian-backed militia stronghold in Syria, a senior official said, intended to deter Iran and its militia from launching rockets at U.S. forces in the region.

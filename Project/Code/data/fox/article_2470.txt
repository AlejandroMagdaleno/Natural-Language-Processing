Climate activists with the Sunrise Movement say they&#39;re going to camp overnight at Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein&#39;s 
Los Angeles
 office until she agrees to meet their far-left demands for the 
infrastructure bills
 making their way through Congress. 
The Sunrise Movement has had 
tense confrontations
 with Feinstein in the past but says the California senator &#34;refused to meet with us&#34; about the infrastructure package. &#34;So unless she starts fighting for our future or flies down here herself and tells use why, we&#39;re not leaving,&#34; the organization said in a document it posted to Twitter.

trespassed onto Cruz&#39;s property
 and refused to leave. 
In 2020, the group 
organized protests
 at the homes of Republican senators to pressure them against confirming the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#39;s replacement.

, ahead of the scheduled inauguration of President-elect 
Joe Biden
 have resulted in some scheduling changes, Biden’s staff said Thursday, according to a report.
A planned rehearsal of the 
inauguration
, initially scheduled for Sunday, has been moved to Monday as event planners continue to make adjustments in response to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, Politico reported.
In addition, an Amtrak ride that Biden and members of his team planned to take from Wilmington, Del., to Washington on Monday has been canceled, the report said.
The Biden team declined to comment on the scheduling changes, the report said.

Journalist Nazira Karimi reflects on living under Taliban rule in the 1990&#39;s and shares her concerns for women who are once again &#39;voiceless&#39; in Afghanistan.
United Kingdom
 Member of Parliament Tom Tugendhat lamented the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan while chastising 
President Biden
 for how he has blamed Afghan forces by accusing them of giving up.
Tugendhat, who served with NATO forces in Afghanistan and was decorated by the 82d Airborne, was dismayed by the disrespect shown to his fellow fighters by the American president.

&#34;To see their commander in chief call into question the courage of men I fought with, to claim that they ran. It&#39;s shameful,&#34; Tugendhat said Wednesday during a session of the House of Commons.

In a Monday address, Biden implied the Afghan forces who fought alongside the U.S. and its allies acted cowardly. He suggested they were to blame for the Taliban being able to swiftly retake control of the country as American forces withdrew, and used that as justification for pulling out of the country.

Tugendhat asserted that it is not armies that win wars. &#34;It is nations that make war. Nations endure,&#34; he said. &#34;Nations mobilize and muster, nations determine and have patience.&#34;

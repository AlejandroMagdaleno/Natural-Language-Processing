FLORIDA HOLOCAUST MUSEUM TAGGED WITH ANTI-SEMITIC GRAFFITI AS HATEFUL INCIDENTS RISE ACROSS US
The administrators said the &#34;intent&#34; of the initial email was to &#34;affirm that Rutgers–New Brunswick is a place where all identities can feel validated and supported&#34; but added that the &#34;impact&#34; of the communication &#34;fell short of that intention.&#34;
&#34;In hindsight, it is clear to us that the message failed to communicate support for our Palestinian community members,&#34; the email read.
Molloy and Conway wrote the university was &#34;enriched by our vibrant diversity&#34; and that &#34;diversity must be supported by equity, inclusion, antiracism, and the condemnation of all forms of bigotry and hatred, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.&#34;
&#34;As we grow in our personal and institutional understanding, we will take the lesson learned here to heart, and pledge our commitment to doing better,&#34; the email said. &#34;We will work to regain your trust, and make sure that our communications going forward are much more sensitive and balanced.&#34;
CNN SHREDDED OVER ‘PATHETIC’ REPORT CRITICIZING EATING HABITS OF ‘ANCIENT JUDEANS: ‘SERIOUSLY, THIS IS NEWS?’
The administrators ended the email by saying they hoped to &#34;learn&#34; from the &#34;mistakes along the way&#34; as they continued to make a &#34;beloved community&#34; at the university.
The initial email called to denounce the &#34;acts of hate and prejudice&#34; against Jewish people and &#34;any other targeted and oppressed groups on our campus and in our community&#34; as the country sees a &#34;recent resurgence of anti-Semitism.&#34;
The email also instructed students who have experienced anti-Semitism to reach out to the school support services and said the university was &#34;working in close partnership with leaders of the Rutgers Jewish community&#34; to address student needs.
According to the 
Rutgers Hillel 
-- a Jewish advocacy organization – the main university campus has 6,400 Jewish undergraduate students and is the &#34;largest Jewish undergraduate population in the country.&#34;
Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., weighed in on the news, asking &#34;how can someone this weak lead a university?&#34;
The email comes as the U.S. sees a massive spike in hate crimes against Jewish people from New York to Los Angeles.

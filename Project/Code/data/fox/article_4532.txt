Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, discusses border security and immigration policy on ‘America’s Newsroom.’
Rep. Henry Cuellar, , D-
Texas
, whose district borders 
Mexico
, says he believes the situation at the border will &#34;become a crisis&#34; if President 
Joe Biden’s
 administration does not take a stronger stance against illegal 
immigration
.
&#34;Is it a crisis? No. Is it getting there? Yes,&#34; Cuellar told &#34;
America’s Newsroom
&#34; on Tuesday.
&#34;The numbers have been increasing … The number of unaccompanied kids, the number of families that are coming in are just increasing every day,&#34; he said. &#34;In my district, just a couple of days ago, 166 people [crossed the border], and it just goes on and just different numbers are going up. So it’s not a crisis yet, but it’s going to get there very soon.&#34;
The 
president has ordered
 a 
pause on funding
 for the border wall and revoked Trump’s pause on green card applicants entering the country because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden also ended the previous administration’s &#34;Remain in Mexico&#34; policy, which allowed immigration enforcement officials to send non-Mexican asylum seekers to Mexico as they waited for their cases to be arbitrated in the U.S. court system.
BIDEN SAYS MEXICO AN &#39;EQUAL&#39; AS HE DISMANTLES TRUMP IMMIGRATION POLICIES
Cuellar told co-hosts 
Bill Hemmer
 and 
Dana Perino
 he believes the administration needs to take action to curb illegal immigration. 
&#34;The words that are spoken are not going to stop them,&#34; he said. &#34;You got organizations, criminal organizations that make billions of dollars, and every time they bring somebody over here, they make a lot of money. So the organizations are going to move around, and you&#39;ve got to have certain processes in place. Otherwise people are going to start continuing.&#34;

The Democratic representative also argued that American citizens, not those who cross the border illegally, should be prioritized to receive COVID-19 vaccines.
&#34;We take care of our people first,&#34; Cuellar said. &#34;That’s what we need to do. So that’s [where] I want to see those vaccines.&#34;

&#34;I got communities in my district, people that have been asking for vaccines in the rural areas of the border towns, and they’re not coming fast enough,&#34; he added. &#34;I think we’re going to see those numbers ramp up with more vaccines, but I want to take care of my citizens first.&#34;
Cuellar has represented Texas’ 28th congressional district, an area located south of San Antonio, since 2005.

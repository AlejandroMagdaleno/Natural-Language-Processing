Former Priest Jonathan Morris explains why the president and other politician&#39;s views on abortion could affect standing in the Catholic church
White House
 Press Secretary Jen Psaki declined to say if 
President Biden
 believes a 15-week-old unborn baby is a human being during Monday&#39;s press briefing.
&#34;Does the president believe that a 15-week-old unborn baby is a human being?&#34; a reporter asked Psaki.
WAPO KNOCKED FOR PAINTING BIDEN AS &#39;DEEPLY CATHOLIC&#39; IN DEBATE OVER COMMUNION: &#39;CLUELESS&#39;
&#34;Are you asking me if the president supports a woman&#39;s right to choose? He does,&#34; Psaki said.
Psaki&#39;s response came after the U.S. Conference of 
Catholic
 Bishops 
voted overwhelmingly
 to draft a formal document on the meaning of the Eucharist after a contentious debate on whether Biden and other politicians who support 
abortion
 policies are worthy of receiving Communion at Mass.

Psaki was asked about Biden&#39;s reaction to the news on Monday.
&#34;Joe Biden is a strong man of faith,&#34; Psaki said.
&#34;The president&#39;s faith is personal. It&#39;s something that has helped guide him through some challenging moments in his life. And that&#39;s how many Americans see their faith as well, not through a political prism. So I would suspect he will continue to attend church, as he has for many, many years,&#34; she continued.
CATHOLIC BISHOPS APPROVE COMMUNION DOCUMENT AIMED AT POSSIBLE REBUKE OF BIDEN
Biden, who attends Mass regularly, has previously said he personally opposes abortion but doesn&#39;t think he should impose that position on Americans who feel otherwise. He&#39;s taken several 
executive actions
 during his presidency that were hailed by abortion rights advocates.
Asked about the Catholic bishops&#39; move on Friday and whether he would be denied Communion, Biden said: &#34;That&#39;s a private matter and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen.&#34;
Some bishops believe Biden forced their hand on making a decision and the church&#39;s credibility was on the line if they didn&#39;t move forward with a document reaffirming core Catholic values.

&#34;It&#39;s not the bishops who have brought us to this point — it&#39;s some of our public officials,&#34; Archbishop Joseph Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas said last week. &#34;This is a Catholic president doing the most aggressive things we’ve ever seen on life at its most innocent.&#34;

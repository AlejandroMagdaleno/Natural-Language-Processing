Alison Anderson, a Texas landowner and the wife of a Customs and Border Protection agent, tells Fox News&#39; Lawrence Jones what it&#39;s like to live near the southern border amid the migrant surge, noting that the situation is &#39;out of control.&#39; 
More than two dozen Republican 
governors
 are demanding a meeting with 
President Biden
 to address securing America&#39;s 
borders
, saying the 
illegal immigration
 surge under the current administration has created an &#34;international humanitarian crisis.&#34;
A letter released Monday signed by 26 
Republican
 governors, including Doug Ducey of Arizona, Ron DeSantis of Florida, and Greg Abbott of Texas, asks Biden to schedule a meeting at the White House within the next 15 days so they can have an &#34;open and constructive dialogue regarding 
border
 enforcement on behalf of U.S. citizens in our states and all those hoping to become U.S. citizens.&#34;

The governors said border apprehensions are up almost 500% compared to last year, and that approximately 9,700 illegal apprehensions have prior criminal convictions. They said more fentanyl has been seized this fiscal year than the last three years combined and that cartels and human traffickers are making millions by smuggling people and drugs across the border. 
&#34;While governors are doing what we can, our Constitution requires that the president must faithfully execute the immigration laws passed by Congress,&#34; the governors wrote. &#34;Not only has the federal government created a crisis, it has left our states to deal with challenges that only the federal government has a duty to solve. 
&#34;Our immigration system may be complicated and complex, but the solution to ending the border crisis is simple and straightforward,&#34; they continued. &#34;As president, you have the ability to take action to protect America, restore security, and end the crisis now.&#34;

The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

Former President 
Bill Clinton
 said he had &#34;nightmares&#34; about what could happen to the future of the U.S. after he left office. 
Clinton said while in office he was &#34;often kept up late at night worrying&#34; about things like Russia’s potential to slip back into communism. 
&#34;After I left office when I had more free time I had more nightmares thinking about what else could go wrong in our country,&#34; Clinton, who was succeeded by President George W. Bush, said. 
The 42nd president appeared on ITV’s show Lorraine with author James Patterson to promote their new book &#34;The President’s Daughter.&#34;
HILLARY CLINTON SAYS PUTIN ‘HELPED ELECT’ TRUMP IN 2016
&#34;By and large I think I have been really happy. I think it’s a foolish thing to spend a day wishing you could do something you can’t do anymore. I made a promise to myself when I was president I wouldn’t do that. It’s been an eventful 20 years since I left office,&#34; he said. &#34;I’ve been very fortunate because under President Bush and President Obama I was given a lot of chances to help.&#34;
Though he didn’t mention helping the Biden administration, Clinton heaped praise on the White House’s current occupant. &#34;I’m happy for President Biden because I think he’s fortunate to be serving at a time when the challenges meet his skill set and his state of mind.&#34; 
Clinton then turned to cancel culture, which he blamed on Republicans.

&#34;The first canceling I ever went through throughout my life was the canceling that people on the right tried to do to people who weren’t,&#34; Clinton said. &#34;Then it became tempting when the demographics changed just to go the other way, but I think if you listen to our book, criticism works better than canceling because I always listen to my critics.&#34;

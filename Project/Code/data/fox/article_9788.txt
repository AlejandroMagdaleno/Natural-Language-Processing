The &#39;Outnumbered&#39; panel discusses Vice President Kamala Harris&#39; reasons for not visiting the border.
White House
 press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday maintained that Vice President 
Kamala Harris
&#39; focus is &#34;not on the border,&#34; but on the &#34;root causes&#34; of migration, amid heightened scrutiny over her new role and questions about why she has yet to visit the U.S. 
southern border
.
Last month, President Biden appointed Harris to serve as the administration’s diplomatic liaison in talks with Mexico and the Northern Triangle nations – Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador – on how best to address the root causes of the migrant surge.
During Monday&#39;s White House press briefing, Psaki was asked why Harris has not visited the border — a question she referred to the vice president&#39;s team.
&#34;But I would tell you also that her focus is not on the border,&#34; Psaki said. &#34;It&#39;s on addressing the root causes in the Northern Triangle, and that&#39;s why the majority of her time has been spent working on a diplomatic level.&#34;

Harris is set to meet with the president of Guatemala on Monday afternoon, and with the president of Mexico next week, Psaki said.

&#34;She&#39;s working with them to ensure there are systems put in place to reduce the amount of migration coming from these countries, but also to address the root causes,&#34; Psaki said.
She added: &#34;And that&#39;s really what the president asked her to do.&#34;
White House officials, earlier this month, maintained that Harris would play a &#34;diplomatic&#34; role and would lead &#34;diplomatic efforts to engage Mexico and the Northern Triangle to address the root causes of migration and to oversee the flow and use of US aid.&#34;

The White House later clarified that Harris wasn&#39;t involved with the &#34;border crisis,&#34; but was instead focused on addressing the &#34;root causes — not the border.&#34;
The Biden administration has been facing a 
continuing border crisis
, with a migrant surge that has led to images of migrant children packed at over-capacity facilities and families being released into the U.S.
On Monday, Psaki said the administration is focused on &#34;expediting moving kids out of these Border Patrol facilities&#34; in order to &#34;reduce the public health impact&#34; on them and the facilities amid the coronavirus pandemic, and move them into spaces where they can properly practice social distance, and ensure the minors have &#34;access to health and medical experts and educational resources.&#34;
&#34;We&#39;ve made some progress on that front,&#34; Psaki said, adding that if Biden or Harris visits a facility of that kind, officials would &#34;have to potentially clear some parts out.&#34;

&#34;There&#39;s a lot of security that comes — our focus here is on solutions, making progress, on moving kids out of these facilities and getting them connected with sponsor homes, with family members, if possible,&#34; Psaki said. 
&#34;And that&#39;s really where the president’s focus is at this point,&#34; she added.

Education Secretary Miguel Cardona testifies at hearing regarding Dept. of Education&#39;s policies and priorities.
President 
Biden&#39;s
 
education secretary got into a testy exchange with a Republican congresswoman as the 
Cabinet
 official refused to say how many genders there are.
During a House Education and Labor Committee hearing on the priorities of the Department of Education, Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., asked 
Education
 Secretary Miguel Cardona about an educational material disseminated to students and their families entitled &#34;Confronting Anti-LGBTQI+ Harassment in Schools.&#34;
Miller highlighted one of the examples of harassment listed on the material, which depicted a teacher telling a student who &#34;identifies as nonbinary&#34; that there are only two genders. 
&#34;Before we start penalizing teachers for stating a genetic and biological fact about genders, can you please clarify for the committee how many genders there are?&#34; the congresswoman asked.
RAND PAUL, IN TENSE EXCHANGE, PRESSES BIDEN’S EDUCATION DEPARTMENT NOMINEE ON TRANSGENDER STUDENT ATHLETES
&#34;So, I know what you&#39;re asking, but I&#39;m going to get to the root of what you&#39;re asking,&#34; Cardona responded, dodging the question. &#34;I feel very strongly, that as educators, it&#39;s our responsibility to protect all students.&#34;
Miller pressed Cardona again to quantify the number of genders that exist, though he again refused. 
&#34;That is an example under your leadership that you are putting out to people,&#34; the Illinois Republican said, referring to 
the document
. &#34;How many genders are there?&#34;

Cardona quickly deflected, asking how Miller would &#34;respond to a student who is nonbinary in your classroom,&#34; but was pressed again by the congresswoman on the number of genders that exist.
&#34;I won&#39;t be answering your question,&#34; Cardona fired back. &#34;You can continue your line of questioning.&#34;
President Biden was 
asked the same question
 during a 2019 campaign stop. Unlike Cardona, Biden provided an answer. 
&#34;There are at least three,&#34; Biden said, before telling the conservative activist who asked him the question: &#34;Don&#39;t play games with me, kid.&#34;

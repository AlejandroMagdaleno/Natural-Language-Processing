Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#39;s niece celebrates Mother&#39;s Day with her daughters and mother on a new episode of Fox Nation&#39;s &#39;Alveda King&#39;s House.&#39;
House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 and the 
White House
 issued Mother&#39;s Day messages on Sunday as some progressives crusading against gendered terms elect to use the term &#34;birthing people&#34; instead.
&#34;Our mothers are our Guardian Angels, and we carry them always in our hearts, whether or not we are blessed to have them with us,&#34; Pelosi, D-Calif., 
wrote
 on Sunday. &#34;Happy Mother&#39;s Day to you and your family.&#34;
REP. CORI BUSH SCORCHED FOR REFERRING TO WOMEN AS ‘BIRTHING PEOPLE&#39;
&#34;Moms have always built, shaped, led, and sustained this country — and we’re committed to fighting for the safe and equitable workplaces, affordable health care, child care, and equal pay that every mom deserves. Happy Mother&#39;s Day,&#34; the White House wrote on 
Twitter
.
However, Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., and pro-choice group NARAL have emphasized the term &#34;birthing people&#34; in recent days.
&#34;Every day, Black birthing people and our babies die because our doctors don’t believe our pain. My children almost became a statistic. I almost became a statistic. I testified about my experience @OversightDems today. Hear us. Believe us. Because for so long, nobody has,&#34; Bush wrote on Twitter on Thursday.
&#34;When we talk about birthing people, we&#39;re being inclusive. It&#39;s that simple. We use gender neutral language when talking about pregnancy, because it&#39;s not just cis-gender women that can get pregnant and give birth. Reproductive freedom is for *every* body,&#34; NARAL 
posted
 on its official Twitter account on the same day.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, mocked the phrase on Mother&#39;s Day.
&#34;Happy Birthing People&#39;s Day!&#34; he wrote on 
Twitter
 alongside a graphic showing the word &#34;Mother&#39;s&#34; erased and replaced with &#34;Birthing People&#39;s.
Republicans also mocked House Democrats earlier this year when they 
unveiled
 a gender-free rules package. 
In an effort to be inclusive to those who don&#39;t identify as a specific gender, the rules package strips all mention of gender-specific pronouns and terms such as &#34;man,&#34; &#34;woman,&#34; &#34;mother&#34; and &#34;son.&#34;

The Office of the Whistleblower Ombudsman, for instance, is renamed in the rules to the &#34;Office of the Whistleblower Ombuds.&#34;

There&#39;s nothing in the rules that prohibit members from using gender-specific terms when speaking on the House floor or conducting business.  
House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., mocked the inclusionary effort as &#34;stupid.&#34;
Fox News&#39; inquiry to Bush&#39;s office was not returned at the time of publication.

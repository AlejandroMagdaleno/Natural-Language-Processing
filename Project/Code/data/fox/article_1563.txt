Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the controversial nomination on &#39;The Story&#39;
A government 
watchdog
 group is putting pressure on the 
Department of the Interior
 (DOI) inspector general to investigate the eco-terror links and misleading statements made by one of 
President 
Biden&#39;s
 
newest officials.
Protect the Public Trust (PPT), a government watchdog organization, filed a complaint regarding Biden’s new Bureau of Land Management (BLM) director, 
Tracy Stone-Manning
.
The complaint calls upon the DOI’s inspector general to look into 
Stone-Manning’s ties to a 1989 tree spiking plot
 by the eco-terror group Earth First! that became a center point of her tumultuous nomination.
SENATE CONFIRMS ECO-TERRORIST-LINKED BIDEN NOMINEE WHO ENDORSED POPULATION CONTROL
Tree spiking is a dangerous and violent eco-terrorism tactic where metal rods are inserted into trees to prevent them from being cut down. The metal rods damage saws that, in turn, have severely injured people, such as a mill worker whose jaw was split in two from an exploding saw.
Additionally, the complaint calls upon the inspector general to &#34;look into actions&#34; of other DOI employees that may have &#34;assisted in misrepresenting facts to Congress,&#34; according to a press release obtained by Fox News.
&#34;The American public expects that high-ranking public servants will act with the highest levels of honesty and integrity,&#34; Michael Chamberlain, director of Protect the Public’s Trust, said in the release. &#34;Certainly, someone in the position to lead an agency with 10,000 employees and a portfolio including a large portion of U.S. land, should exemplify these traits.&#34;
&#34;Sadly, Ms. Stone-Manning’s responses to the legitimate inquiries of the public’s elected representatives don’t appear to be anywhere close to this standard,&#34; he continued. &#34;Even more disappointing is that, despite the Biden Administration’s pronouncements of being the most ethical in history, Ms. Stone-Manning’s ethical challenges do not appear unique in Secretary Haaland’s Department of the Interior.&#34;
In a 50-45 party-line vote, Tracy Stone-Manning was confirmed as the director of BLM last month.
The vote came amid a cacophony of political noise blaring from the White House&#39;s compounding crises and debate on the infrastructure bill, with the Senate Democrats slipping the controversial nominee&#39;s confirmation through.

Stone-Manning’s nomination saw robust opposition from conservatives in Congress and outside the halls, with Adam Brandon, president of conservative and libertarian advocacy group FreedomWorks, saying it &#34;should come as no surprise&#34; Biden’s nominee holds her views &#34;seeing as she collaborated with eco-terrorist groups with ties to Ted Kaczynski.&#34;
Stone-Manning eventually lost support from major backers and former Democrat officials, including the Dallas Safari Club and former Obama-era BLM leaders.

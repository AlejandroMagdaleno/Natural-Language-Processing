Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., explains how the left&#39;s jam-packed coronavirus relief bill is an attempted &#39;reshaping of America.&#39;
Congressional Democrats have pushed ahead with a jam-packed 
coronavirus
 relief bill which 
Sen. Lindsey Graham
, R-S.C., told &#34;
Sunday Morning Futures
&#34; is an attempt to transform America as we know it.
&#34;It&#39;s a reshaping of America,&#34; he said. &#34;This is a trilogy of radical policy, and I hope the American people are paying attention because if you&#39;re not, you&#39;re going to wake up in a few years and your country will not be the nation you remember it being.&#34;
The Senate narrowly passed the $1.9 trillion legislation through a vote of 50-49 on Saturday. Graham said the contents of the bill have little to do with COVID-19 relief and instead focuses on racial reparations and changes laws surrounding gender identity.
SEN. JOSH HAWLEY: DEMOCRATS&#39; POLICIES HAVE FORCED AMERICAN WORKERS TO COMPETE WITH &#39;SLAVE LABOR&#39;
&#34;If you&#39;re in the farming business right now, this bill forgives 120% of your loan based on your race,&#34; he explained. &#34;These people in the congress today – the House and the Senate on the Democrat side – are out-of-control liberals, and God help us all if we don&#39;t check and balance them in 2022.&#34;
Aside from other non-coronavirus-related inclusions like $200 million for library services and $20 million for native language studies, Graham argued the House has managed to produce consistently damaging legislation in the last 30 days alone. This includes the H.R. 1 voting rights bill, described by the senator as &#34;open borders for voting,&#34; and the Equality Act.

&#34;The federal government is going to take over the voting systems in this country,&#34; he said. &#34;There will be no checks and balance; no verification of who you are.&#34;
&#34;And, finally, the Equality Act – that doesn&#39;t get enough attention,&#34; he went on. &#34;They passed a bill that does away with the distinction between being a man and woman in the law… And if you&#39;re a religious organization out there and your faith dictates that certain things happen, this bill takes that ability to say no away from you.&#34;
The senator assured that both pieces of legislation &#34;will come to the Senate and will die in the Senate&#34; because of the 60-vote filibuster rule.

Religious leaders are worried about the Equality Act, which is expected to pass in the House, because it makes no provision for religious objections and some warn that it could outlaw standing up for traditional views on marriage. Could this violate the core principle of freedom of religion? Here to debate, former Obama faith adviser Christopher Hale, and Shane Idleman, lead pastor of Westside Christian Fellowship in California.
Three 
House Republicans
 broke with their colleagues on Thursday and supported the Equality Act, which conservatives have described as an assault on 
religious liberty.
Reps. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., John Katko, R-N.Y., and Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., all joined the more than 200 Democrats supporting the legislation. In total, the bill passed with a 224-206 vote.
The controversial legislation is expected to have a tough time making its way through the Senate, although the White House says President Biden will sign it if able.

The bill seeks to amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Jury Selection and Services Act.
&#34;We stand firmly against discrimination in any form. Throughout my tenure in Congress, we have fought to ensure all are treated fairly before the law, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation,&#34; Katko said.

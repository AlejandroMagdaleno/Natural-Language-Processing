Fox News&#39; Howard Kurtz says its unclear if Congress will be able to pass a bipartisan bill
A Republican congressman blasted 
President Biden’s
 infrastructure plan as a &#34;five-lane highway&#34; barreling toward socialism.
Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., took the president’s trillion-dollar plan to task on Tuesday on social media, likening the Democrats&#39; infrastructure plan to socialism.
&#34;Infrastructure to Democrats is a five lane highway to socialism,&#34; the congressman wrote on Twitter.
BIDEN REVERSES POSITION ON SIGNING BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL: ‘I FULLY STAND BEHIND IT’
Biggs expanded on his tweet in a statement to Fox News, saying the Democrats &#34;have interwoven the socialist policies of the Green New Deal into their infrastructure framework every step of the way.&#34;
&#34;When Americans think of infrastructure they think of roads, bridges, and airports,&#34; Biggs continued. &#34;Not unrealistic climate goals that increase our dependence on communist China or social welfare programs that the Far Left deems ‘human infrastructure.&#39;&#34;
The White House did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment on Biggs’ criticism of the infrastructure package endorsed by Biden.
Biden and Republican lawmakers last week came to a consensus on an infrastructure compromise bill that would modernize U.S. infrastructure to the tune of $953 billion, but then the president reversed course and said he would not sign the measure unless a broader Democrat spending bill was also included.
&#34;If this is the only thing that comes to me, I’m not signing it,&#34; Biden said of the bipartisan infrastructure deal to reporters on Thursday. &#34;It’s in tandem.&#34;
Days later on Saturday, the president walked back his comment, putting his political weight behind the compromise package.
&#34;The bottom line is this: I gave my word to support the Infrastructure Plan, and that’s what I intend to do,&#34; Biden said in a Saturday statement. &#34;I intend to pursue the passage of that plan, which Democrats and Republicans agreed to on Thursday, with vigor.&#34;

&#34;It would be good for the economy, good for our country, good for our people. I fully stand behind it without reservation or hesitation,&#34; Biden said.
The president is in 
Wisconsin
 on Tuesday in an attempt to sell the nearly $1 trillion infrastructure plan, touting it as a win for middle class families.

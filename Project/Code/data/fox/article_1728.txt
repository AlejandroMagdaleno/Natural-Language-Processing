Newt Gingrich slams Biden administration over the enormous ‘cost’ of allowing illegal immigrants into the country. 
Newt Gingrich
 said Thursday that 
Kamala Harris,
 
Nancy Pelosi,
 and 
Chuck Schumer
 appear to be the ones running the White House. 
Gingrich, during an appearance on 
&#34;Fox and Friends,&#34;
 said that he believes that Biden is a &#34;very minor force&#34; in the White House and slammed the &#34;Harris-Biden administration&#34; for laying out the &#34;welcome mat&#34; to illegal immigrants, which he claimed would eventually &#34;shake the fabric&#34; of American society.

My assumption is he is a very minor force inside that building and that the White House is increasingly run by Harris, Pelosi, and Schumer.&#34;

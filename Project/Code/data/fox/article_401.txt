‘Outnumbered’ panel weighs in; Leslie Marshall calls the move ‘funny and clever marketing.’
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
, assigned partial blame to 
Facebook
 for last week&#39;s riots and indicated Friday that Congress&#39; response should focus on holding Big Tech accountable rather than ramping up domestic surveillance.
&#34;He is part of this problem,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez said, referring to CEO Mark Zuckerberg. &#34;And Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook bear partial responsibility for Wednesday&#39;s events, period.&#34;
Ocasio-Cortez, who spoke during a video town hall meeting, went on to argue that Facebook was &#34;trying to do as much damage control as possible, but they knew. Not only did they know but they allowed it.&#34;
Facebook did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment. Earlier this week, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg suggested that other platforms were to blame.
FACEBOOK CRITICIZED BY DEMS, LIBERAL WATCHDOG FOR SKIRTING CAPITOL RIOT BLAME
&#34;Our enforcement’s never perfect, so I’m sure there were still things on Facebook -- I think these events were largely organized on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate, and don’t have our standards and don’t have our transparency,&#34; she said during an interview 
broadcast
 by Reuters.
However, technology experts have said that a 
growing amount of evidence
 indicates at least some of the planning for the riots took place on Facebook.
Ocasio-Cortez&#39;s criticism came in response to a question about how to prevent domestic terrorism without enhancing government surveillance or beefing up police resources -- both of which the congresswoman opposed. Instead, she argued, White supremacists had benefited from a lack of accountability for social media giants and Trump&#39;s decision to weaken programs targeting their operations.
As a member of the House Oversight and Finance Committees, Ocasio-Cortez will likely continue to play a role in pressing big tech for answers on the impact of their platforms on terrorist networks. During her town hall, she referred viewers to a 
testy exchange
 the two had during a financial services hearing last year. 
DOES FACBOOK NUKING &#39;STOP THE STEAL&#39; POSTS MAKE IT HARDER TO TRACK RIOT ORGANIZERS?
&#34;We knew this was a problem,&#34; she told constituents Friday. &#34;We knew this so far out that pre-COVID, I asked him specifically about election disinformation and its ties on Facebook to White supremacist organizations, and the ties that &#39;fact-checking organizations&#39; had to other White supremacist outlets ... and he wouldn&#39;t answer. So, there&#39;s a very clear link here.&#34;
Shortly after the riots, Zuckerberg announced he was suspending Trump&#39;s ability to post on his account. 
In a statement, the social media giant defended its record of enforcement actions against a variety of groups.
&#34;In recent days and weeks, we have also taken enforcement action consistent with our policy banning militarized social movements like the Oathkeepers and the violence-inducing conspiracy theory QAnon,&#34; Facebook executives said in a press release.  &#34;We’ve also continued to enforce our ban on hate groups including the Proud Boys and many others. We’ve already removed over 600 militarized social movements from our platform.&#34;
As President-elect Biden takes office, he will presumably face pressure from the left to regulate social media and a host of other issues like immigration.
At one point Friday, Ocasio-Cortez was asked about whether Democrats would make immigration reform -- specifically legal protection for &#34;Dreamers&#34; -- a priority. She noted that while she was dissatisfied with the party&#39;s past performance on the issue, she anticipated it would unite behind it under the new administration.

&#34;I remember seeing it, and experiencing it in real-time, and how disheartening it felt to feel like immigrant families were put on the backburner for you know, whether it&#39;s a political reason, legislative reason, what have you,&#34; she said. 
It&#39;s unclear exactly what she was referring to, but the Obama administration 
came under fire
 in 2014 when it decided to hold off on immigration reform until after the midterm elections.

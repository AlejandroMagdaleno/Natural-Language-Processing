Sen. Elizabeth Warren
 released a campaign ad last month that accused &#34;Trump Republicans&#34; of &#34;coming to grab power&#34; in California.
In her ad, she explained to voters that they will be receiving a mail-in ballot with just two questions on it – the first, whether Newsom should be recalled, and second, who should replace him. 
Democrats across the U.S. have taken to social media to tell Californians to only vote &#34;no&#34; on their ballots and to leave the second section blank to avoid confusion.
Former communications director for both Newsom and Harris, Nathan Click, told voters in a tweet, &#34;Voting NO is the only way ensure we don’t have a Trump Republican as Governor in one month’s time.&#34;

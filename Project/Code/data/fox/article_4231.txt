Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., challenged the Speaker&#39;s rule saying it is &#39;pure manipulation&#39; on &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39;
U.S. Reps. 
Marjorie Taylor Greene,
 R-Ga., and 
Thomas Massie
, R-Ky., humorously responded to warning letters from the Capitol sergeant at arms on Wednesday advising them they had violated the 
chamber’s mask rules. 
&#34;You can’t discriminate against people simply because they won’t wear a mask,&#34; Greene said in a video she posted to Twitter. She then put the warning letter she said explained she could face a $500 fine if she continued to not wear a mask into a shredder. &#34;Here’s what I think of your warning, 
Speaker Pelosi,
&#34; the Georgia congresswoman said. 
Massie, in the same spirit, put his letter (and what he said was a second warning letter) into his trash can filing cabinet.
&#34;Just filed @SpeakerPelosi’s letter warning me to follow her mask rule,&#34; Massie tweeted, showing the warning letter in the garbage.
&#34;@SpeakerPelosi sent me another letter,&#34; he tweeted later after he trashed the second letter. &#34;Something about violating her tyrannical and unscientific mask rule. I filed this one in the same location.&#34; 
Massie also accused Pelosi of being a &#34;hypocrite&#34; for photos that showed her going to the White House without a mask. 
While the White House has lifted the mask requirement for fully vaccinated people, Pelosi has kept it in place in the House despite new federal guidance that says vaccinated people can go most places without masks.

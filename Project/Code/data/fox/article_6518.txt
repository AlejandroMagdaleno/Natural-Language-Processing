State Assemblywoman Aileen Gunther blasts fellow Democrat on &#39;The Story&#39; amid scandal
A 
New York
 Democratic state assemblywoman ripped Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 on 
&#34;The Story&#34;
 Monday after more controversial behavior came to light.
As Cuomo was getting into a car following an event in Mount Vernon, N.Y., a female supporter yelled a comment at him. The governor, who is under investigation over allegations of sexual assault and making inappropriate advances toward women, was recorded replying: &#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere, darling.&#34;
Assemblywoman Aileen Gunther described the remark as &#34;shocking&#34;.
&#34;&#39;I&#39;m not going anywhere, Darling
&#39;
?&#34; Gunther remarked. &#34;I thought that that was unbelievable. Rather than shut your mouth, instead, [accuser] number eight comes forward and you&#39;re still acting very cocky.&#34;
Gunther, who was first elected to the New York State Assembly in 2003, told host Martha MacCallum that she remembered the last time a New York governor was embroiled in scandal, 
pointing to Democrat Eliot Spitzer
.
&#34;You know, I remember when Spitzer was [call girl] client number 9. The governor [Cuomo, then New York&#39;s attorney general] said that he should resign the next day,&#34;
&#34;We have 
[Cuomo accuser] number eight
 coming forward. For the good of the budget, for the good of New York State during a very, very volatile time -- you know, we have people dying of COVID, we have people that need immunizations -- it&#39;s time that we have leadership that will bring us to some sort of peace.&#34;
MacCallum later asked Gunther about comments 
reported by The New York Times
, in which he 
expressed outrage
 at then-Working Families Party Chairman Bill Lipton in 2018.
Lipton&#39;s party 
had been considering
 endorsing Cuomo&#39;s Democratic primary challenger, actress Cynthia Nixon, and had referred to Cuomo as &#34;better than a Republican&#34; in comparison to the more liberal Nixon.
&#34;If you ever say, &#39;he&#39;s better than a Republican&#39; again. I&#39;m going to say &#39;You&#39;re better than a child rapist&#39; -- how about that?&#34; Cuomo reportedly told Lipton.
Lipton replied that he wanted Cuomo to understand the main point of the remark, which was that &#34;we have differences with you&#34; while &#34;our differences with Republicans are far greater.&#34;
When Lipton finished making his clarification, Cuomo shot back: &#34;I think you&#39;re better than a child rapist.&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s just unbelievable,&#34; Gunther said, &#34;and for somebody who is a leader of one of the great states, of New York, it&#39;s absolutely shocking. It&#39;s time. You know, we&#39;ve had, during my tenure, three other men that were accused that stepped down the next day.
&#34;Again, he tells Spitzer to step down the next day. Being cocky and being a bully won&#39;t work this time.&#34;

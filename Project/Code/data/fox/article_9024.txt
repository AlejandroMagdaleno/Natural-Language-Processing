Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., tells ‘Fox News Sunday’ DHS Sec. Mayorkas is making ‘false’ claims about the Trump administration dismantling previous border policies. 
Sen. 
Tom Cotton
, R-Ark., called on 
President Biden
 to reimpose three Trump-era border policies as critics accuse the Biden administration of inviting 
illegal immigration
 through their policies.
Migrant children are 
arriving
 at the U.S. 
southern border
 at rates faster than they can be processed and transferred to sponsor homes, a senior Customs and Border Protection official told Fox News, all while the Biden administration has repeatedly denied that there is a &#34;crisis&#34; at the border. 
&#34;The Biden administration keeps saying that Trump somehow dismantled the immigration system. That&#39;s false. It was the Biden admin that dismantled three highly effective policies,&#34; Cotton told &#34;
Fox News Sunday
&#34; this week.
PSAKI USES ‘CRISIS&#39; TO DESCRIBE SITUATION AT THE BORDER, THEN WALKS IT BACK
He called on Biden to extend public health exclusion to all migrants, including minors, and revive both the &#34;
Remain in Mexico
&#34; policy and &#34;safe third country&#34; agreements with countries like Guatemala.
&#34;The public health exclusionary order, they lifted that order as it relates to minors. Well, guess what we have now at the border? Lots more minors. That&#39;s not a surprise,&#34; Cotton said.

In February, the U.S. began 
admitting migrants
 waiting in 
Mexico
 for their immigration cases to be processed, part of the Biden administration winding down Trump-era protocols including &#34;Remain in Mexico.&#34;
Cotton touted one more policy, safe third country agreements.
&#34;The so-called safe third country agreement with countries like Guatemala that says if you pass through a country that&#39;s not your own seeking asylum, you have to make that asylum claim in the first country you pass through. That&#39;s the international norm,&#34; Cotton said. &#34;Joe Biden could re-impose all three of those things this week if he wanted to.&#34;

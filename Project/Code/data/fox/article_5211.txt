Jonathan Bush, a younger brother to the late President George H.W. Bush and uncle to 
former President George W. Bush
, 
died
 hours short of his 90th birthday.
A statement Thursday from the George and Barbara Bush Foundation said that &#34;the foundation pauses to mourn the passing of President Bush&#39;s beloved brother Jonathan. Our prayers and love are with the Bush family as we remember a wonderful husband, father, grandfather and brother, a fine gentleman, and a noble soul.&#34;
&#34;And knowing Jonathan, he also would like for us to observe he was a great song and dance man -- without a doubt the best dancer of his siblings, all of whom he now joins in heaven,&#34; the statement read.
According to the foundation, Bush died Wednesday night, hours before his birthday, which is Thursday.

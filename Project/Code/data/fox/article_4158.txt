FIRST ON FOX:
 The National 
Republican
 Senatorial Committee will run an ad in 
Georgia
 during the 
MLB&#39;s
 All-Star Game and Home Run Derby criticizing Sen. Raphael Warnock over the fact the MLB moved the event from Atlanta to Denver over Georgia&#39;s election security law. 
The ad, first obtained by Fox News, will run during both the Home Run Derby on ESPN Monday, July 12 and the All-Star Game itself the following day, which will air on Fox. The NRSC told Fox News that the ad buy will cost about $100,000 in total. 
&#34;The All-Star Game, a $100 million boost to Georgia&#39;s economy, until the radical left woke crowd took it all away, forcing the MLB to boycott Georgia,&#34; the ad says. &#34;Even Stacey Abrams opposed the boycott, but Sen. Warnock refused to oppose it.&#34; 
Warnock, D-Ga., did not explicitly call for the All-Star Game to leave Georgia. He tried to take a moderate position between supporting those who were upset about a law that Democrats called voter suppression and not explicitly advocating for action that could hurt his constituents economically.

‘WOKE’ MLB, TICKETMASTER TARGETED IN $1M AD CAMPAIGN
&#34;I think we all have to use our voices,&#34; he said on 
CNN
 when asked whether boycotts of big events in Georgia should be options for activists. 
And he said that businesses should not boycott Georgia in a tweet after the MLB decided to move the All-Star Game, while blaming Republicans for Georgia missing out on the potential economic gain. 
&#34;It wasn’t the people or workers of GA who crafted SB 202—it was politicians seeking to retain power at the expense of Georgians&#39; voices. And today’s decision by @MLB is the unfortunate consequence of these politicians’ actions,&#34; Warnock said in early April when the MLB decided to move its game to Denver. 
&#34;I hope businesses, athletes &amp; entertainers can protest this unjust law not by leaving GA, but by coming here &amp; fighting voter suppression head on with the community,&#34; Warnock added. &#34;And the urgency to pass federal voter protection laws, which I’m fighting hard for, grows every day.&#34;
But Republicans still place the blame for the economic hit of the MLB&#39;s move squarely with Warnock and other Democrats, who they say were not forceful enough in their opposition to boycotts of the state.

&#34;Sadly, it was their very own Senator who helped run the All-Star Game and $100 million out of Atlanta,&#34; NRSC Chairman Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said in a statement. &#34;Even Stacey Abrams, after initially supporting boycott efforts, changed her tune and vocally opposed a boycott of Atlanta and its small businesses. But Raphael Warnock refused to condemn this boycott that hurt Georgia families.&#34;
Warnock won his seat in a runoff election in January but will have to face voters again next year because his race was a special election to replace retired Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. Republicans see Warnock as one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents going into the midterms.

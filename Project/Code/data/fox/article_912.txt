Fox News foreign correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest developments from Gaza
President Biden
 on Monday condemned &#34;despicable&#34; anti-Semitic attacks against American Jews in the U.S. who have found themselves targets of death threats, hate speech and violent physical attacks amid the conflict between 
Israel
 and Palestinians.
&#34;The recent attacks on the Jewish community are despicable, and they must stop,&#34; Biden said. &#34;I condemn this hateful behavior at home and abroad--it&#39;s up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor.&#34;
TOP DEMS TEPID ON SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL, AMID HAMAS ATTACKS, PRESSURE FROM FAR LEFT
Biden&#39;s comments come as New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois, Utah, Arizona and Florida have seen a wave of anti-Semitic attacks against American Jews.
The fighting between Israel and Hamas came to a stop after more than 200 deaths over 11 days on Friday when Israel announced a cease-fire, which was negotiated with the help of Egypt, the neighboring country that for decades has served as a mediator in conflicts in the region.
But before the cease-fire agreement, Democratic leaders including the president and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., walked a thin line between backing Israel&#39;s right to defend itself and avoiding alienating vocal anti-Israel voices within their own party.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced a resolution Thursday to force a vote on whether to block weapons sales to Israel.
&#34;At a moment when U.S.-made bombs are devastating Gaza, and killing women and children, we cannot simply let another huge arms sale go through without even a Congressional debate,&#34; Sanders said in a statement, referring to the United States&#39; $735 million arms deal with Israel that has come under scrutiny in recent days.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., also backed the Sanders effort.
US SEEING WAVE OF ‘TEXTBOOK ANTI-SEMITISM’ AMID ISRAEL-GAZA TENSIONS
&#34;The United States should not be rubber-stamping weapons sales to the Israeli government as they deploy our resources to target international media outlets, schools, hospitals, humanitarian missions and civilian sites for bombing,&#34; she said.
Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., accused Israel of &#34;terrorism&#34; while a flood of Democrats hit the House floor to give speeches against Israel. Some took aim at the Biden administration&#39;s policy toward Israel, including Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.
&#34;As long as the message from Washington is that our military support for Israel is unconditional, Netanyahu&#39;s extremism right-wing government will continue to expand settlements, continue to demolish homes and continue to make the prospects for peace impossible,&#34; she said.
And in the wake of the cease-fire, Tlaib said, &#34;The U.S. must condition funding to uphold human rights, and end the funding entirely if those conditions are not met.&#34; Tlaib got into a heated exchange with Biden during a visit to Michigan this week when she confronted him, before later saying on MSNBC, &#34;Enough, President Biden… You have to speak out against this violence in a very aggressive way.&#34;
Some Democrats, however, did issue strong pro-Israel statements both on the House floor and in answering questions from the press. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., proclaimed on the House floor that &#34;Hamas and Islamic jihad are single-handedly responsible for the escalation that has led to the bloodshed of Israelis and Palestinians… Israel has every right to defend herself.&#34;
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., also backed Israel.

&#34;Hamas, a terrorist organization who has made it very clear that they want to see Israel obliterated from the Middle East, the Jewish state to be destroyed.,&#34; Hoyer said. &#34;Israel&#39;s right to defend themselves against such an attack.&#34;
But Democrats, including Omar, have condemned anti-Semitic violence, including an incident at a Los Angeles sushi restaurant reported by the Los Angeles Times that is being investigated as a hate crime. 
Fox News&#39; Tyler Olson, Yael Halon, and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

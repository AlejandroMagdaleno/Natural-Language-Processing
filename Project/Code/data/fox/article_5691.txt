Former Trump impeachment attorney Alan Dershowitz joins &#39;The Ingraham Angle&#39; with reaction and analysis
Former 
President Trump
 will not testify in his 
Senate impeachment trial
, Fox News has learned. 
&#34;The president will not testify in an unconstitutional proceeding,&#34; Trump senior adviser Jason Miller told Fox News Thursday. 
The former president&#39;s legal team fired back at impeachment manager Jamie Raskin&#39;s request Thursday for Trump to testify as part of the Senate impeachment trial, calling it a &#34;public relations stunt&#34; and saying they &#34;cannot prove&#34; the allegations against him.
The comments come after House impeachment managers requested that Trump provide testimony under oath either before or during the Senate impeachment trial about &#34;his conduct&#34; on Jan. 6.

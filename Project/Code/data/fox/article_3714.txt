EXCLUSIVE: 
The 
Federal 
Reserve
 has instructed employees to adopt &#34;bias-free language&#34; and avoid using biased terms like &#34;Founding Fathers,&#34; according to an internal webpage obtained by Fox News. 
The Federal Reserve&#39;s Board of Governors issued the guidance for all employees nationwide on April 29, a former Fed staffer with knowledge of the matter told Fox News.
DALLAS FEDERAL RESERVE CHIEF AGREES THAT ‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’ IS A DRAG ON US ECONOMY
&#34;Bias-free language recognizes diversity and avoids stereotyping, demeaning, or excluding people on the basis of gender, race, ethnic group, religion, age, ability/disability, or sexual orientation,&#34; the guidance states.
&#34;Try to avoid words and phrases that may be considered offensive, pejorative, or prejudiced (whether consciously or unconsciously), as these can distract your audience from the ideas/information you’re trying to convey,&#34; it continues.

The guidance contains a list of &#34;biased terms&#34; to avoid, including &#34;blacklist,&#34; &#34;grandfathered,&#34; and &#34;Founding Fathers.&#34; Employees are instructed to use terms like &#34;denied,&#34; &#34;legacy,&#34; and &#34;Founders&#34; instead. 
The Fed also said the terms &#34;whitelisted, &#34;manpower,&#34; &#34;manmade,&#34; and &#34;singular generic pronouns&#34; – such as &#34;he,&#34; she,&#34; &#34;his,&#34; and &#34;hers&#34; – should be replaced with more &#34;bias-free&#34; alternatives like &#34;allowed,&#34; &#34;artificial,&#34; and pronouns such as &#34;they,&#34; &#34;their&#34; and &#34;theirs.&#34;

on college campuses
, where they have 
caused controversy

San Diego officials in 2016 had to 
walk back similar guidance
, which instructed city employees not to use the term &#34;Founding Fathers,&#34; before it was scrapped. 
In a statement, a Federal Reserve spokesman said: &#34;The Federal Reserve has no language directives for employees.&#34;

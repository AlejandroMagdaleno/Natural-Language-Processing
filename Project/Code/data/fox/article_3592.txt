Republican Kevin Faulconer calls for &#39;California Comeback&#39; in &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39; interview
A recall election of Democratic 
California 
Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
, which appears increasingly likely to take place, will lead to a &#34;California comeback,&#34; Republican former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer told &#34;
Fox News Primetime
&#34; Friday. 
&#34;I think he is going to be recalled, and I am going to run,&#34; Faulconer told host Trey Gowdy.
Supports of a recall election have until March 17 to collect the 1,495,709 signatures -- equivalent to 12% of California&#39;s population -- required to trigger a vote. Organizers say they have collected more than 1.4 million signatures so far. 
&#34;[There is] so much momentum right now in California because people want a change, and I just launched my campaign this week,&#34; Faulconer said. &#34;We are talking about a California comeback.&#34;
NEWSOM RECALL CAMPAIGN &#39;AT THE 10-YARD LINE&#39;, CLEARS 1.4 MILLION SIGNATURES
Faulconer noted he launched his campaign this week in front of a closed public school.
&#34;Across the corner [from] where I was, was a private school that was open with teachers and kids [attending] safely, because that school reports to parents, but the school I was in front of, the public school, reports to Gavin Newsom and it&#39;s closed,&#34; he said. &#34;This is just absolutely unacceptable and everyone in California -- Democrats, independents, Republicans, they all agree. We need to open our schools now. Not next week, not next month, now.&#34;
Turning to another key issue in California, homelessness, Faulconer claimed that San Diego was the only city in the state to reduce homelessness &#34;by double digits&#34; during his tenure.

&#34;The issue of protecting our California jobs, keeping them here and keeping them going in California -- I’m going to be a governor that does just that,&#34; he said.
The last Republican to serve as governor of California was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was voted into office in 2003 following the recall of Democrat Gray Davis.

Former Trump senior adviser discusses the repercussions of Biden&#39;s border policies.
Attorneys general across the nation have been standing up to narrowing 
immigration
 reform via lawsuits filed against the Biden administration, and former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller backed the importance of these actions to national security.
&#34;The lawsuit being filed by Florida, along with Texas and Arizona, is the most important lawsuit that is happening in the country right now,&#34; he said on &#34;
Sunday Morning Futures.
&#34;
In early March, Florida AG Ashley Moody filed a lawsuit to halt Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) guidance that narrows the number of illegal immigrants prioritized for arrest and deportation. Several other states, such as Arizona, Texas, Montana and Louisiana, followed suit.
FLORIDA LAWSUIT AGAINST BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SAYS ICE GUIDANCE PUTS AMERICANS IN DANGER
Miller explained that under &#34;normal&#34; administrations, detained immigrants would be placed into ICE custody to then be deported. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has halted this procedure in a majority of cases.
&#34;So all of those criminal offenders are now being released back into the U.S. population,&#34; he said. &#34;The result of that is going to be a massive amount of recidivism – innocent people are going to get hurt, innocent people are going to get killed, innocent people are going to suffer irreparable damage as a result of that decision.&#34;
&#34;And if there’s anything in the world that a judge should enjoin and say, ‘No, this is illegal,’ it’s that ICE directive.&#34;
Miller accused the left of attempting to change rhetoric surrounding violence in America. He insisted that the war on law enforcement has caused a major spike in crime and it must be challenged.

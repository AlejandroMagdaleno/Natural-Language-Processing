Trump senior adviser Jason Miller previews the former president’s impeachment trial on ‘America’s News HQ.’
Republicans
 who backed the push to impeach former President 
Donald Trump
 are now facing backlash from their constituents.
Freshman Rep. Peter Meijer, R-Mich., as well as more established members of the Republican Party like Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., and Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., are defending themselves as voters voice their displeasure.
Republican groups in three Nebraska counties have voted to censure Sasse for attacking Trump’s unsuccessful efforts to overturn the election results and for claiming Trump helped incite the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, the 
Omaha World-Herald
 reported. 
The issue continues to divide the party – and threatens to loom large in primary races that are still years away.

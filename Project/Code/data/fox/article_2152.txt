Fox News contributor Leo Terrell on the recall effort against California Gov. Gavin Newsom gaining over 2 million signatures.
California
 Democratic Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
 reportedly raised $538,000 from online donors in 48 hours to combat a likely recall campaign against him.
Newsom&#39;s anti-recall campaign started up on Monday and has received donations from all 50 states, although a majority of contributions were from California, San Francisco Chronicle journalist Alexei Koseff 
reported
 on Thursday.
NEWSOM RECALL COULD IGNITE FUNDRAISING FREE-FOR-ALL IN CALIFORNIA
However, Newsom opponents have already poured millions into the recall effort.
&#34;We&#39;re expecting there to be a continued and high interest in this recall. We&#39;ve raised $3 million so far for the signature drive. We expect to raise another $15 million for the campaign,&#34; David Galliard, chief strategist for RescueCalifornia.org, told Fox News.

Galliard&#39;s group and RecallGavin2020.com, the other major recall organization, say they&#39;ve collected more than 2 million voter signatures to date – far more than the 1.5 million valid signatures needed to get a recall election on the ballot later this year. The petition signatures were turned in Wednesday to the registrars in California&#39;s 58 counties.
Two Republicans launched campaigns earlier this year – former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and wealthy businessman John Cox, who was the 2018 GOP gubernatorial nominee who lost to Newsom. Cox has already invested a couple of million of his own money into his campaign. Former GOP Rep. Doug Ose announced his candidacy Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Newsom has 
suggested a racist motive
 behind the effort to recall him, saying the authors of the petition fear California is becoming less White under his leadership.

&#34;Look at the petition, look at the actual reasons they themselves listed. It has to do with immigration. The ‘Browning’ of California,&#34; Newsom said, using air quotes to emphasize &#34;Browning.&#34;

President Biden
 on Wednesday seemed to publicly urge 
Rep. Maxine Waters
, D-Calif., to run for senate-- a gesture that seemed to even surprise the congresswoman.
Biden was at a bill signing and was joined by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Jesus &#34;Chuy&#34; Garcia, D-Ill.; and Waters. A video from the event showed Biden turn to Garcia and then to Waters. He shook their hand. 
&#34;Senator, I hope,&#34; he said, as he looked as Waters. The 82-year-old representative seemed to play off the comment as a joke and patted him on the back. Biden turns away and said, &#34;You think I’m kidding, I’m not.&#34;
The Republican National Committee seized on the comment and questioned the president&#39;s true desire for bipartisanship.

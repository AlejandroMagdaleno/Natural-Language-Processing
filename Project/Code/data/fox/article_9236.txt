FOX News Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the latest. 
Former President 
Donald Trump&#39;s
 appeal to 
Latino
 voters may have been more widespread than originally thought, according to new research.
Democrats touted their focus on increasing turnout among minority voters for the 2020 elections, but Latino voters with low involvement in politics shifted toward Trump, according a new 
report
 from Equis Labs, which describes itself as focused on the &#34;Latinx community.&#34;

&#34;Trump gains seemed to be unique among those identifying as Latino across geography and place of origin,&#34; the researchers wrote.
Trump also &#34;galvanized&#34; conservative Latinas, while liberal Latinas lost enthusiasm about voting, according to the report.

Democrat-linked Equis Labs offered various theories about why Trump appealed to Latino voters, including &#34;dog whistle politics &amp; racial status anxiety&#34; and &#34;activation around religion, SCOTUS and QAnon.&#34;
&#34;Neither party should assume that a Hispanic voter who cast a ballot for Trump in 2020 is locked in as a Republican going forward,&#34; the researchers wrote. &#34;Nor can we assume this shift was exclusive to Trump and will revert back on its own.&#34;
Trump&#39;s increased support from Latino voters in 2020 to 2016 was not enough to win him the election, however. President Biden won Latinos by a roughly two-to-one margin, while Trump had the support of roughly one in three, according to 
exit polls

PELOSI SAYS SHE HAS CONFIDENCE IN HARRIS ADDRESSING ROOT CAUSES OF BORDER CRISIS
The Biden administration has been facing a dramatic surge in migrants at the border -- particularly unaccompanied children, who the Biden administration is not removing via Title 42 public health protections that are being used to remove some families and single adults.

There are currently more than 20,000 migrants in HHS custody, up from just under 12,000 at the end of March. The Associated Press reported that 
migrants are being housed
 at more than 200 sites in multiple states.

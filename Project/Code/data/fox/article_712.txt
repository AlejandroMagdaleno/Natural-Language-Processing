FOX News White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the details on &#39;Special Report&#39;
President Biden&#39;s adviser overseeing the situation at the southern 
border
 had a slip of the tongue during a press conference, where she mistakenly said that the border was not closed.
While speaking at a White House press conference on Wednesday, former Ambassador Roberta Jacobson — Biden&#39;s adviser overseeing the crisis at the southern border — told prospective illegal migrants to the United States that the border was closed and it was not time to come to the U.S.

However, Jacobson had a slip of the tongue when she translated the message to Spanish, mistakenly saying &#34;la frontera no está cerrada.&#34;
The botched phrase used by Jacobson translates to &#34;the border is not closed.&#34; Jacobson corrected herself in Spanish soon after, clarifying &#34;la frontera está cerrada&#34; — the border is closed.&#34;

&#34;Migrants have become a commodity,&#34; an anonymous Mexican official told Reuters, saying that migrants are now valued as highly as illicit narcotics.
&#34;But if a packet of drugs is lost in the sea, it’s gone,&#34; continued the official. &#34;If migrants are lost, it’s human beings we’re talking about.&#34;
Law enforcement at the border encountered more than 100,000 migrants at the border in February, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced Wednesday, as the Biden administration faces a 
dramatically escalating crisis
 – and admits the numbers are &#34;overwhelming.&#34;
CBP encountered 100,441 individuals in February, a 28 percent increase over January, the agency said. Of those, 19,246 individuals were in family units; 9,457 were unaccompanied children (UACs) and 71,598 were single adults.

Jonathan Turley, law professor and Fox News contributor, argues the former president ‘can be charged’ for inciting the Capitol riot, but says he has ‘serious doubts’ the case would succeed.
The 
U.S. Capitol Police Labor Union
 on Monday delivered an &#34;overwhelming vote of No Confidence&#34; on the senior leadership of the U.S. Capitol Police. 
The vote comes after the Executive Board of the Capitol Police Union last week called for its members to consider a vote of no confidence following the senior leadership’s mishandling of the

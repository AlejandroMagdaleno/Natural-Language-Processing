Turning Point USA president Charlie Kirk and New York Post op-ed editor Sohrab Ahmari joins &#39;Fox News @ Night&#39; to discuss
WASHINGTON — President 
Joe Biden
 made wistful remarks about the freedom of the vice president’s residence — including the swimming pool in which he reportedly skinny dipped — when asked how he was 
settling into the White House
 on Tuesday.
At a 
CNN town hall
 in Milwaukee, host Anderson Cooper asked the new commander in chief how he was liking his new digs at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. — which Biden swiftly compared to a &#34;gilded cage.&#34;
&#34;I wanted to be president not to live in the 
White House
, but to be able to make the decisions about the future of the country,&#34; Biden said, admitting he had never been inside the White House residence during his eight years as Barack Obama’s vice president.
&#34;So living in the White House, as you’ve heard other presidents who have been extremely flattered to live there say, it’s a little like a gilded cage in terms of being able to walk outside and do things,&#34; he went on.
SNUBBED BY OBAMA? JOE BIDEN SAYS WHITE HOUSE &#39;RESIDENCE&#39; WAS UNSEEN BY HIM -- UNTIL HE MOVED IN
Biden then said he missed the freedom of 
the vice president’s official residence
, which is on the grounds of the US Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.

      While he served as vice president, Joe Biden often enjoyed the swimming pool at the VP&#39;s residence, according to reports.
      
Vice President Kamala Harris and husband Doug Emhoff are living 
across from the White House
 while that property is being renovated.
&#34;The vice president’s residence it’s totally different,&#34; Biden told Cooper.
&#34;You’re on 80 acres, overlooking the rest of the city, and you can walk out, there’s a swimming pool, you can walk off the porch in the summer and jump in the pool and go into work.
&#34;You can ride a bicycle around and never leave the property. You can work out, but the White House is very different,&#34; he said.
The pool seemed to be Biden’s favorite part of the residence to the point where his 
parting remarks
 to successor Mike Pence and wife Karen in 2014 were, &#34;You’re gonna love the pool,&#34; Karen Pence has said.
A salacious 2014 book based on interviews with Secret Services agents assigned to protect Biden claimed that a then-Veep Biden loved skinny dipping in the pool.
Author Ron Kessler claimed that Biden loved to 
get in the buff
 and go for a dip in the pool installed by predecessor Dan Quayle.
&#34;Agents say that, whether at the vice president’s residence or at his home in Delaware, Biden has a habit of swimming in his pool nude,&#34; Kessler wrote in his book, &#34;The First Family Detail: Secret Service Agents Reveal the Hidden Lives of the Presidents.&#34;

&#34;Female Secret Service agents find that offensive,&#34; he added.
In 2010, Biden told reporters that Quayle was his &#34;favorite vice president&#34; because he put in the pool, noting, &#34;my granddaughters love it.&#34; 
The pool at the White House is installed behind the Oval Office patio, meaning it would be almost impossible for Biden to go for a naked swim without his staff getting an eyeful.

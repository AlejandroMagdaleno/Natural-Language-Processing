The mayor of 
San Antonio
 and a county judge sent a letter to Gov. 
Greg Abbott
 asking for permission to enforce mask wearing in schools and government buildings after the Republican governor shot down talks of mask mandates in the state. 
&#34;The time for government mask mandates is over—now is the time for personal responsibility,&#34; 
Abbott tweeted Tuesday

He and Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff also sent a letter
 Wednesday to Abbott requesting the ability to enforce masks.

Metro Health sent a text notification
 this week to Bexar County residents advising them to wear masks indoors regardless of vaccination status, which falls in line with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s updated guidance this week. 
The CDC had said in May that fully vaccinated people were not required to wear masks indoors, but updated its mask guidance Tuesday for vaccinated people over the threat of the delta variant of the virus. It now urges people in some areas of the country with &#34;high&#34; or &#34;substantial&#34; COVID-19 transmission to mask up indoors.

Democrat says White House &#39;made a mistake&#39; by pressuring him to support Biden COVID relief plan on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Sen. 
Joe Manchin
, D-W.Va., defended his 
vote to advance
 a Democratic budget resolution Tuesday that would lay the groundwork for 
President Biden
’s $1.9T 
COVID
 relief package in the Senate, but maintained that he would not support the final legislation unless Congress could make it &#34;work in a bipartisan way.&#34;
Manchin, a moderate with a reputation for working across party lines, is believed to be the key vote who could advance or block his colleagues&#39; attempts to pass the Biden proposal via budget reconciliation. With the Senate split 50-50, Democrats have little margin for error.
&#34;What I have told everybody, I made it very clear, from the President of the United States to all of my colleagues, we&#39;re gonna make this work in a bipartisan way,&#34; Manchin told &#34;
Special Report
&#34; host Bret Baier.
 &#34;My friends on the other side are going to have input, and we are going to do something we agree on,&#34; the senator added.
MANCHIN, UNDER PRESSURE, BACKS COVID-19 AID RESOLUTION USING &#39;RECONCILIATION&#39;
&#34;My friends on the other side are going to have input, and we are going to do something we agree on.&#34;
Although Manchin&#39;s vote is critical for Biden&#39;s proposal to pass without support from Republicans, the West Virginia senator told Baier that he is &#34;not going to do ... just a party-line vote.
&#34; It has to make sense,&#34; he explained, &#34;and if it&#39;s out of the realm of what makes sense, of what we’ve worked on together, we&#39;ve built too much trust up to allow this to fall apart. So they can count on me to make sure I do everything to make sure this is done bipartisan.&#34;
Manchin has come under immense pressure in recent weeks-- most recently from Vice President Kamala Harris, who was 
criticized 
over the weekend for appearing to pressure Manchin and fellow moderate Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona into supporting the administration&#39;s bill in a pair of 
interviews 
she did with local TV stations.
MANCHIN PRESSURED AHEAD OF COVID-19 STIMULUS VOTE 
Harris &#34;made a mistake, and It shouldn&#39;t have been done,&#34; Manchin said. &#34;A mistake was made. We&#39;re going to make mistakes ... to err is human. With that being said, I have spoken to the president about that and I have spoken to some of his top officials.&#34;
Manchin believes Democrats won&#39;t get enough votes to pass the stimulus package &#34;down the line&#34; without Republican support.  As for his vote earlier Tuesday, Manchin said he told his colleagues, &#34; fine, we&#39;ll start this process, but I want you to know, I will vote in a bipartisan way.&#34; 
The senator also told Baier that he believed it was unlikely that proposals like a $15 national minimum wage would be in the final legislation.

&#34;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to make it in ... [because the] only thing we can do during during this reconciliation is anything that comes within the financial realms of what we&#39;re dealing with,&#34; he explained. &#34;It&#39;s called a budget. Reconciliation has to be within the budget lines. That does not come within that at all, and it really needs to be debated ... Some states already have [a] $15 [minimum wage]. I think anybody that goes to work in the morning and works 40 hours a week and works 50 weeks a year, that&#39;s 2,000 hours, should be ... above the poverty guidelines. And that&#39;s not $15.
Manchin later expressed continued opposition to the effort among Senate Democrats to remove the filibuster, telling Baier that he believes there are several others within his party &#34;who feel exactly like I do&#34; on the issue.

Texas Republican senator discusses Biden Cabinet nominee confirmation hearings on &#39;Hannity&#39;
Attorney General nominee 
Merrick Garland
 repeatedly 
&#34;dodged&#34; questions
 from Republican senators during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. 
Ted Cruz
, R-Texas, told &#34;
Hannity
&#34; Monday.
&#34;He has a reputation of being relatively nonpartisan as a judge,&#34; Cruz told Sean Hannity, &#34;[but] I will say the hearing was frustrating as it went on today because he basically dodged every question. He refused to answer any question. He answered like a judicial nominee and not like a nominee to be attorney general.&#34;
Garland avoided directly responding to Cruz&#39;s questions relating to the Durham investigation into the Trump-Russia probe origins, the protection of the Second Amendment, and whether crossing the border illegally should be a criminal offense. 
&#34;It was a really disappointing performance in total,&#34; Cruz said, &#34;because he would not be candid, he would not be forthcoming.&#34;
THREE QUESTIONS AG PICK MERRICK GARLAND DODGED FROM SENATE REPUBLICANS
Cruz also joined the 
chorus of conservatives 
voicing opposition to 
Xavier Becerra
, 
Biden’s
 nominee to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The senator described Becerra as an &#34;extremist&#34; who would carry a radically liberal agenda if confirmed.
CONSERVATIVES OPPOSE BECERRA NOMINATION
&#34;The Biden administration likes to talk about [how] they&#39;re science-based and their priority of stopping COVID, well ... he&#39;s not a doctor,&#34; Cruz said, highlighting Becerra&#39;s background as a trial lawyer.
 &#34;If a Republican nominated a trial lawyer to lead [the] Health and Human Services department in the midst of a global pandemic, they would be laughed out of the room because it would be absurd,&#34; Cruz said.

&#34;And yet, the Biden administration&#39;s focus is on paying off the liberal special interest, not on being based on the science and defeating the pandemic.&#34;
As for the media&#39;s reaction to his Cancun family vacation that dominated headlines over the weekend, Cruz said plainly, &#34;I think the media is suffering from Trump withdrawal, where they’ve attacked Trump every day for four years they don&#39;t know what to do, so they obsess over my taking the girls to the beach.&#34;

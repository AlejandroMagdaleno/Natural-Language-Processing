Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt joins ‘Fox News Sunday’ to discuss the Jan. 6 bipartisan commission to investigate the Capitol riot.
As 
Senate
 Democrats push for a bipartisan commission to investigate the 
Jan. 6 riot
 at the Capitol, 
Sen. Roy Blunt
 said he believes it’s &#34;too early&#34; to start such a probe and that Republicans will likely vote against it.
Blunt, R-Mo., told &#34;
Fox News Sunday
&#34; anchor Chris Wallace that &#34;commissions often don’t work at all&#34; and that it &#34;would take months just to get a staff ready to look at things.&#34;
The House 
approved a bill
 to form a commission last week, but some Senate Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, oppose the measure.
KINZINGER CHARGES THAT MCCARTHY ‘FAILED TO TELL THE TRUTH’
Blunt argued that there isn&#39;t enough information known about the insurrection to create a bipartisan commission, unlike the commission set up in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
&#34;I do think that the 9/11 commission had a lot more information available to it when it started than this one would have,&#34; the senator said. &#34;And we made a lot of decisions before the 9/11 commission started that were important to further secure the Capitol and further look at our intelligence failures.&#34;
Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., argues House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy lied to Americans regarding details of the January 6 attack on the Capitol
The priority on Congress, he said, should be to secure the Capitol, rather than answer lingering questions about what was going on inside then-President Donald Trump&#39;s White House at the time.
&#34;Is the priority to secure the Capitol, to do what we need to do to better train, better prepare Capitol Police, decide what we want to do in the future?&#34; Blunt said. &#34;Or is the priority to take, what will be a couple of years in my view, to decide what happened inside the White House?&#34;

Blunt said the Senate is working on its own bipartisan report that will look to answer unresolved questions, including the National Guard’s slow response time, and provide a timeline of how the events that day unfolded.
That report could be released as early as next month.

President Biden
 told a heartfelt story last week about an Amtrak conductor congratulating him for riding more than 1.5 million miles – but the details of the story don&#39;t seem to add up.
&#34;When I became vice president, one of the Capitol Hill newspapers estimated that I had taken more than 7,000 round trips on Amtrak over my career. I think that&#39;s an exaggeration. I&#39;m going to rely on those two conductors … one of them was a guy named Angelo Negri,&#34; Biden said Friday at an 
event
 marking Amtrak&#39;s 50th anniversary.
REP. MAST ASKS BIDEN TO INTERVENE AFTER VETERANS GROUP DENIED USE OF PENTAGON PARKING LOT
&#34;There was an article, I guess my fourth or fifth year as vice president, saying Biden travels 1,300,000 miles on Air Force One [Two]. I used to – the Secret Service didn&#39;t like it – but I used to like to take the train home. My mom was sick and I used to try to come home almost every weekend as vice president to see her. I got on the train and Angelo Negri came up and he goes, ‘Joey, baby,’ and he grabbed my cheek like he always did. I thought he was going to get shot. I&#39;m serious. I said, &#39;No, no, he&#39;s a friend.&#39; 
&#34;He said, &#39;Joey, what&#39;s the big deal? 1,300,000 miles on Air Force Two? Do you know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?&#39; I said, &#39;No, Angie, I don&#39;t know.&#39; He gave me the calculation and he said you traveled 1,500,000 miles on Amtrak. The fact is, I&#39;d probably take Angie&#39;s word before I&#39;d take the word of what the article said.&#34;
Biden&#39;s comments have flown under the 
media
 radar so far. However, a few elements of the story seemed out of place. Biden entered the fourth year of his term as vice president around 2013, and Negri&#39;s 
obituary
 states he retired from Amtrak in 1993, while Biden was still a senator. Meanwhile, Biden&#39;s mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan, died in 2010.

Additionally, Biden&#39;s office celebrated him hitting 1 million miles on Air Force Two in 2015.
&#34;A few months ago, Vice President Joe Biden crossed the million-mile mark aboard Air Force Two – the official plane of the Vice President. … I wanted to give you a sense of what those more-than 1 million miles have looked like these past seven years,&#34; Biden&#39;s vice presidential photographer David Lienemann wrote in a 
blog post
 in February 2016.
Biden&#39;s remarks are in the White House 
transcript
 of the event nearly word-for-word. But the administration made headlines in March for 
quietly correcting
 a gaffe Biden made during a news conference in which he appeared to mix up the names of 
Afghanistan
 President Ashraf Ghani and the controversial former head of Pakistan&#39;s military. 
&#34;And General Austin is – just met with Kayani and I’m waiting for the briefing on that,&#34; Biden said Thursday. 
But the official White House transcript of the briefing now says &#34;Ghani&#34; instead of Kayani.

Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani departed the Pakistan military in 2013. In a retrospective on Kayani&#39;s leadership, 
The New York Times
 reported that Kayani was often accused of &#34;double-dealing and bad faith.&#34;

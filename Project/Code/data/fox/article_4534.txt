Democrats move forward with a $1.9T stimulus package; Griff Jenkins breaks down what&#39;s inside the plan.
Senators
 took 41 roll call votes on a litany of controversial issues during the Senate&#39;s marathon vote-a-rama that lasted more than 15 hours from Thursday into Friday -- concluding with a party-line vote to advance the budget resolution and set up a filibuster-free process for 
Democrats
 to pass 
coronavirus
 relief without GOP help.
Republicans in the 50-50 Senate with Vice President Harris as the tiebreaking vote didn&#39;t have the juice to stop the chamber from moving ahead under a process called budget reconciliation. But they did manage to force Democrats into uncomfortable votes all night. 
&#34;We&#39;re going to put senators on the record,&#34; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday ahead of the all-nighter. &#34;Expect votes to stop Washington from actively killing jobs during a recovery — like terminating the Keystone pipeline; that job-killing, one-size-fits-all minimum wage hike; and whether to bar tax hikes on small businesses for the duration of this emergency.&#34;

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., meanwhile hit Republicans for pushing &#34;messaging amendments&#34; to &#34;score political points.&#34; 
SENATE ADOPTS BUDGET RESOLUTION FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF AFTER REPUBLICANS SQUEEZE DEMS IN MARATHON VOTE-A-RAMA
Among the other high-profile issues Senators were forced to vote on during the vote-a-rama were court-packing, oil and gas leasing, religious freedom, abortion, immigration, and getting kids back in schools. 
There were also a handful of voice votes, most notably one backed by Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, in which the Senate opposed any minimum wage hike during the pandemic. 
Here&#39;s a guide to all of the votes that the Senate took during the vote-a-rama, some of which will likely be making appearances in 2022 campaign ads.

&#39;Fox News @ Night&#39; looks into human rights issues in China and how world governments have failed to intervene
President Biden
 has yet to declare reported atrocities by China against Uyghurs in the country&#39;s western Xinjiang province to be genocide even after Canada’s parliament voted Monday to pass a nonbinding motion applying the classification. 
According to reports last year, up to 3 million Uyghur Muslims in China&#39;s western Xinjiang province have been taken from their homes since 2017 by 
authorities and disappeared
 into a prison camp, which the Chinese government glosses over as a re-education facility.
The BBC 
reported
 this month that women in those camps have been systematically raped, sexually abused and tortured. Europe increases pressure on the Chinese Communist government.
The European Union Tuesday urged China to allow access by independent observers to investigate reports of secret detention camps, forced sterilization and political indoctrination.

Biden, who vowed to be tough on China while on the campaign trail, has been careful not to classify the human rights abuses against the Uyghurs since entering office. The Trump administration declared the actions by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as genocide one day before vacating the White House.
The president didn&#39;t mention China’s human rights abuses during a virtual meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Tuesday. He said that the U.S. and Canada are coordinating &#34;approaches to better compete with China and to counter threats to our interests and values.&#34;

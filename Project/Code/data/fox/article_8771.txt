Gov. Greg Abbott, the 
Texas
 Republican, tweeted out late Sunday that he intends to sign a bill that would essentially prevent cities in the state to defund police departments.
The governor retweeted a post from Kenneth Casaday, the president of the Austin Police Association, that was critical of the response time for a shooting call early Sunday. 
Casaday said the call came in at 5:35 a.m. and there were no units available in the city to respond for 12 minutes. He said the victim suffered a critical injury after being shot in the head. Police finally arrived at the scene at 5:51 a.m., he said.

Abbott used the shooting to underscore the need for police funding and said, &#34;This is what defunding the police looks like.&#34;
&#34;Austin is incapable of timely responding to a victim shot in the head. Texas won’t tolerate this,&#34; he said.
Austin police did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News seeking information about the shooting that Casaday mentioned and if funding restraints played a role in the response time.
The Austin American-Statesman 
reported 
that the City Council voted last year to reallocate up to $150 million from the police department. The paper reported that the city reduced the department’s operational budget by about $21.5 million. The paper said the savings were made by delaying to police academies.

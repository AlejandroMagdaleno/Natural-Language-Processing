President Biden
 is declining to call the situation at the southern border a crisis – even amid reports that his administration needs another 20,000 beds at migrant facilities to deal with a surge of 
unaccompanied minors

&#34;We had the security of Homeland Security yesterday conveying it’s a challenge,&#34; Psaki replied. &#34;We’re going to approach this without labeling. We’re going to approach this with policy, with humanity and with a focus on what we can do to keep these kids safe.&#34;
Experts predict as many as 117,000 unaccompanied minors will cross the border this year.

&#34;The numbers have been increasing,&#34; he told &#34;America’s Newsroom&#34; Tuesday afternoon. &#34;The number of unaccompanied kids, the number of families that are coming in are just increasing every day. In my district, just a couple of days ago, 166 people [crossed the border]… So it’s not a crisis yet, but it’s going to get there very soon.&#34;
He said the influx would not slow down until the president takes action.
&#34;The words that are spoken are not going to stop them,&#34; he said.

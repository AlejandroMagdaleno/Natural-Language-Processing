CIEN+ CEO and co-founder Lili Gil Valletta discusses the impact of Hispanic voters in California&#39;s gubernatorial recall election
California
 Gov. 
Gavin 
Newsom
 snapped last week while talking to reporters, ranting that everyone outside the Golden State is &#34;b----ing&#34; about it.
Newsom, who is facing a 
closer-than-anticipated
 recall election, spoke to the Sacramento Bee in an interview last week in which he grew angry at critics of California.

Clips from interview have since gained steam online, where they have been making the rounds on 
social media
.
&#34;It would be nice if our homegrown team would be focusing on what&#39;s right,&#34; the embattled governor yelled. &#34;Everybody outside this state is b----ing about this state.&#34;
&#34;Guys, forgive me, I know I am a little pointed today but I&#39;ve been taking a lot from you folks for a lot of months,&#34; Newsom said while waving his hand toward the reporters. &#34;I should be able to express myself, too.&#34;
The irate governor also stood by his scandal-marred tenure as governor, remarking that Texas and Florida could &#34;eat their hearts out&#34; about the jobs California has created.
&#34;I&#39;m a future ex-governor,&#34; the governor also said in the 
interview
. &#34;It could happen in a few weeks, it could happen in a few years. I love this damn state.&#34;

Fox News national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin says she couldn&#39;t fact-check the president&#39;s &#39;misrepresentations&#39; of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan fast enough during his speech.
Secretary of Defense
 Lloyd Austin contradicted 
President Biden
 on Friday, telling House lawmakers on a phone call that multiple Americans trying to reach the 
Kabul airport
 have been beaten by Taliban fighters, two lawmakers told Fox News.  
Austin called the beatings &#34;unacceptable,&#34; a person on the phone call told Fox News. Austin&#39;s remarks starkly contrasted with what Biden told reporters after 
his speech on Friday
. 
When asked about reports that some Americans were being blocked from reaching Hamid Karzai International Airport for evacuation, Biden denied that any Americans were having such trouble.

&#34;We have no indication that they haven&#39;t been able to get in Kabul through the airport. We&#39;ve made an agreement with with the Taliban thus far.&#34;

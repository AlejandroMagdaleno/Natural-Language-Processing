Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul opens up about being surrounded by protesters after leaving White House.
Kelley Paul, wife of 
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
, slammed the lack of accountability faced by mobs and violent thugs who have threatened her family. 
In a pair of tweets Tuesday, Paul recounted the times she and her husband were targeted – yet authorities took no action against the culprits. 
She referenced the time a &#34;Republican-hating woman&#34; called Sen. Paul’s D.C. Senate office, threatening to shoot his entire staff. She said she had just learned that that person will not be charged. 
MISSOURI AG BLASTS DOJ DIRECTIVE AS ‘UNCONSTITUTIONAL EXPANSION’ OF FEDERAL POWER AS CRITICISM MOUNTS
No one faced charges for the time she and her husband were 
attacked by a mob
 as the pair made their way back to a hotel following Donald Trump’s Republican National Convention acceptance speech at the White House last year.
Neither did anyone face charges for fake anthrax and 
death threats
 being sent to their home, she said. 
&#34;I’m exhausted and angry,&#34; Paul wrote.
She noted that people who &#34;express indignation at a school board meeting&#34; about Critical Race Theory or mask mandates will be the target of the Biden administration. 
That comment referred to Attorney General Merrick Garland’s 
directive
 to the FBI Monday night to hold meetings with federal, state
,
 and local law enforcement leaders to discuss ways to combat what the DOJ called a &#34;disturbing trend&#34; of &#34;harassment and threats against school officials.&#34;

Sen. Paul said that the lack of charges being filed against the person who threatened to shoot his entire family is another example of how violence is excused for the Left. 
&#34;When Kelley learned today that a person who threatened to shoot us would not be prosecuted, she felt that it was another example of how violence is excused for the left, yet a mom who raises her voice at a school board meeting is to be treated as a domestic terrorist by the Biden administration,&#34; Paul said in a statement provided to Fox News.

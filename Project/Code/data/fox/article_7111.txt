Pennsylvania
 Lt. Gov. John Fetterman raised eyebrows on Friday by claiming that &#34;lies&#34; about the 
2020 presidential election
 are not constitutionally protected. 
Fetterman, a high-profile Democrat who is mulling a Senate run in 2022, slammed those who declared that his state was one of several that were &#34;rigged&#34; in favor of 
President-elect Joe Biden
.
&#34;This idea that saying that Pennsylvania was &#39;rigged&#39; or that we were &#39;trying to steal the election,&#39; that&#39;s a lie,&#34; 
Fetterman told The Hill
. &#34;And you do not have the right, that is not protected speech.&#34;
Fetterman argued that tweets by 
President Trump
 echoing the false claim should have been removed by Twitter &#34;immediately&#34; and insisted such an action was &#34;not de-platforming&#34; but rather &#34;deleting lies that are yelling &#39;fire&#39; in a crowded theater when there is none.&#34;
TWITTER &#39;WHISTLEBLOWER&#39; LEAKS VIDEO OF DORSEY TELLING STAFF ACTIONS WILL BE &#39;MUCH BIGGER&#39; THAN TRUMP BAN
&#34;That is not protected speech,&#34; Fetterman doubled down. &#34;He can talk all day about what his favorite football team is or that he&#39;s the greatest president in the history of the world, but no one -- Republican, Democrat, or whatever -- has the right to say those kind of incendiary lies.&#34;
Critics were quick to fact-check Fetterman&#39;s remarks on social media. 
&#34;WARNING LABEL: &#39;This claim is determined to be ridiculously false.&#39; Signed, US Constitution,&#34; journalist Sharyl Attkisson quipped. 
&#34;Getting really tired of being stuck between clowns insisting that certain bad/wrong speech being protected means we shouldn&#39;t condemn it and other clowns claiming that speech they don&#39;t like or that is bad should be illegal,&#34; conservative writer A.G. Hamilton reacted.
AOC&#39;S SUGGESTION OF COMMISSION TO &#39;REIN IN&#39; MEDIA SLAMMED AS 
&#39;WHOLLY UN-AMERICAN&#39;
&#34;Like it or not (guess which side I fall on), that IS protected speech. And it&#39;s irresponsible to aver otherwise,&#34; National Review podcast host Jeff Blehar tweeted.
&#34;What if the lies about &#39;trying to steal the election&#39; are published and echoed by the republic&#39;s most prominent media outlets, and are repeatedly debunked but nevertheless consistently revived by those outlets quoting anonymous officials, over half a decade? Hypothetically?&#34; Ted Cruz national security adviser Omri Ceren asked, alluding to the media&#39;s years-long coverage of the Russian collusion narrative.
&#34;This man is a statewide elected official? He shows zero grasp of the principles of free speech or the protections of the First Amendment,&#34; former Trump campaigna adviser Steve Cortes said.

Fetterman isn&#39;t the only prominent Democrat to suggest that spreading falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election should be illegal. Earlier this week, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., floated a congressional &#34;commission&#34; to &#34;rein in&#34; the media&#39;s role in spreading what lawmakers would determine is &#34;disinformation and misinformation.&#34;

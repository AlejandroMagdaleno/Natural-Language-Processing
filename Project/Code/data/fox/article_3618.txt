Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich reacts to leaders from around the globe condemning Big Tech’s censorship of President Trump.
Social media giant 
Facebook
 said earlier this week that it will remove all content containing the phrase &#34;stop the steal&#34; in order to cut down on &#34;content that could incite further violence,&#34; but online crackdowns can make 
law enforcement&#39;s
 job more difficult when it comes to tracking down threats.

statement
 on Monday that it is working with law enforcement while removing #StoptheSteal content.

&#34;As was the case through the 2020 elections, we’ve continued to proactively reach out to federal and local law enforcement and we are providing information in response to valid legal requests,&#34; Facebook said. &#34;As always, we will continue to remove content, disable accounts and work with law enforcement when there is a risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.&#34;

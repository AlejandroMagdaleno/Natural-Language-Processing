Former President 
Trump
 on Saturday hinted that he might run for 
president
 again in 2024 during a visit on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 to the New York Police Department&#39;s (NYPD) 17th precinct.
The former president, a New York native, spoke briefly about the 
Sept. 11, 2001
, attack on the World Trade Center, the recent Afghanistan withdrawal and took questions from the police officers. 
Trump called the 20th anniversary of 9/11 a &#34;very sad day for a lot of reasons,&#34; referring to both the attack and the botched withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in recent weeks, and praised the brave NYPD officers.
&#34;I grew up with you and you are New York&#39;s finest. You&#39;re incredible people. I know many of you,&#34; said Trump.

The former president also called Biden&#39;s withdrawal from Afghanistan &#34;gross incompetence&#34; and criticized other aspects of the U.S. withdrawal. 
When asked by a NYPD officer whether he&#39;d run for president a second time, Trump responded, &#34;That&#39;s a tough question.&#34;
&#34;Actually, for me, it&#39;s an easy question. I mean, I know what I&#39;m going to do, but I&#39;m not supposed to be talking about it yet from the standpoint of campaign finance laws, which, frankly, are ridiculous,&#34; said Trump.

Nevada
 Gov. Steve Sisolak signed a bill Friday that would hand his state the coveted first primary in the nation during presidential elections.
The measure aims to transform Nevada’s caucuses into primaries and allow the state to jump ahead of 
Iowa
 and 
New Hampshire
. Nevada’s primaries would take place on the first Tuesday of February. 
But in order to be enacted, the law still needs the approval of the national political parties. GOP chairs in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and even Nevada released a statement last week saying they wanted to preserve the historic timetable.
Democrats, led by former Sen. Harry Reid, have lobbied to move Nevada to the front of the line, citing Iowa’s chaotic reporting of results last year, when the count was not finalized until nearly a month later.

&#34;It’s time for Nevada to take its rightful place, not just first in the West but in the nation, as a diverse state, a state with diverse issues,&#34; said Democratic Nevada Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson, who sponsored the legislation, according to the 
Des Moines Register.

Caucuses are in-person gatherings that can last several hours, with voters choosing sides publicly, whereas primaries function much like general elections.

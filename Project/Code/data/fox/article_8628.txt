Democrats to introduce bill adding four justices to the Supreme Court
The Democratic push to expand the 
Supreme Court
 has led to opponents resurfacing Democrats&#39; &#34;We Need Nine&#34; campaign in support of then-Judge Merrick Garland&#39;s 2016 nomination, which emphasized the need for nine justices on the high court. 
Republicans on Thursday reminded Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., the lead Senate sponsor on a bill expanding the court from nine to 13 seats, of his 2016 position.
&#34;This you?&#34; asked Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., who posted a 2016 picture of Markey at a podium emblazoned with the hashtag &#34;#WeNeedNine.&#34;
DEMOCRATS KICK OFF PUSH TO PACK SUPREME COURT WITH FOUR NEW JUSTICES
Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., also took a shot, saying he &#34;thought we only needed nine?&#34;
Markey was far from the only Democrat making the case that the Supreme Court needed nine justices in 2016.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in 2016 that every &#34;day that goes by without a ninth justice is another day the American people’s business is not getting done.&#34;
Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., also called for &#34;nine justices serving on the highest court in the land&#34; in 2016, adding that &#34;the American people deserve a fully-functioning Supreme Court.&#34;

The Supreme Court has become the hot topic in Washington after Markey and his colleagues introduced the controversial legislation designed to pack the Supreme Court.

Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., one of the original sponsors in the House, posted a video on Twitter Thursday defending the attempt to pack the Supreme Court by invoking the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
&#34;This crisis didn’t arrive overnight or by accident,&#34; 
Jones said
 in the video that showed images of the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot. &#34;The Supreme Court helped bring us here. In fact, the court has been actively dismantling our democracy for years.&#34;

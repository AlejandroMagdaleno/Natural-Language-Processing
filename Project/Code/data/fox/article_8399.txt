Democrats are working to ditch the filibuster, but Sens. Manchin and Sinema might stand in Biden&#39;s way. Fox News&#39; Chad Pergram with more.
Sen.
 Kyrsten Sinema
, D-Ariz., is the target of new ads funded by a 
dark money group
 whose liberal projects are bankrolled by a billionaire foreign organization.
Just Democracy, a racial and social justice grassroots coalition, 
announced
 last week that they would be running a &#34;six-figure ad campaign&#34; against Sinema &#34;for prioritizing the filibuster over voting rights for Black and Brown Arizonans.&#34;
One of the ads claims Sinema has become &#34;the problem&#34; in Washington because of her support for the centuries-old senatorial procedure that has helped preserve the minority party’s voice in government.
LIBERAL DARK MONEY GROUP LAUNCHES ADS TARGETING SINEMA, MANCHIN TO SUPPORT S1 ELECTION BILL
&#34;Senator Sinema, we voted for you because you promised to break the gridlock in Washington and help us get good paying jobs and affordable healthcare,&#34; the 
ad
 says. &#34;But since going to Congress, you&#39;ve become the problem instead of getting things done.&#34;

The ad, which is narrated by a Black pastor, claims Sinema defending the filibuster has resulted in more Washington &#34;gridlock&#34; and that nixing the filibuster &#34;would put an end to the political games.&#34;
&#34;We get things done that have support across party lines,&#34; the add continues.
According to 
OpenCorporates
, Just Democracy is just one of 
dozens
 of trade names used by the far-left dark money group Sixteen-Thirty Fund, which has spent millions in election cycles.
The Sixteen-Thirty Fund is bankrolled by Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss, who pumped $135 million into the dark money group between 2016 and 2020. Wyss said he is not an American citizen in 2014.
AOC SLAMS KYRSTEN SINEMA&#39;S FILIBUSTER &#39;DEFEATISM&#39;: &#39;OUR JOB IS TO HELP PEOPLE&#39;
The Sixteen-Thirty Fund does not identify its donors and threw at least $1.3 million behind lobbyists pushing for the Democrats’ election overhaul bill, S.1.
The VoteVets Action Fund, the dark money advocacy arm of the liberal group VoteVets, targeted Sinema and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., last month by launching ads in Arizona and West Virginia trying to get their constituents to pressure them to support S.1, the For the People Act.
Sinema has repeatedly been pressed by reporters about her position on the filibuster, but she has defended the filibuster, 
saying
 it &#34;helps protect the country from wild swings between opposing policy poles.&#34;
&#34;Instability, partisanship and tribalism continue to infect our politics. The solution, however, is not to continue weakening our democracy’s guardrails,&#34; Sinema continued in a Washington Post op-ed last month. &#34;If we eliminate the Senate’s 60-vote threshold, we will lose much more than we gain.&#34;

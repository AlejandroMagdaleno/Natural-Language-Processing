Democrat John Liu joins &#39;Your World&#39; to explain why he and his colleagues want to rescind governor&#39;s emergency powers
New York
 lawmakers from both parties are working to strip Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo

State Sen. John Liu, one of 14 Democrats in the upper chamber of New York&#39;s state legislature who support the move, told &#34;

...
We&#39;ve been asking the executive branch, the governor, for information. That was not information we wanted out of caprice or whim, it was information that our constituents were demanding of state government. As their representative to state government, we needed to provide that information. We needed to have that information ...

The governor says there was a federal investigation. They didn&#39;t want to get involved in the politics with Trump. That&#39;s fine, but that still does not account for the months of stonewalling and delay. And to this day, they still don&#39;t seem to be forthcoming with the information.

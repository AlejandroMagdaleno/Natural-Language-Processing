FOX News White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Fifty-eight percent of Americans approve of the job
 President Biden
 is doing handling the federal government’s response to the
 coronavirus pandemic.
But the same survey from 
Quinnipiac University 
also shows that when it comes to the president’s handling of the
 reopening of schools 
amid the COVID crisis, Biden’s approval rating plummets.
Biden said Tuesday night during a nationally televised prime time town hall in Wisconsin that those comments were &#34;a mistake in the communication.&#34;
Only 42% of those surveyed by Quinnipiac say they approve of the job the Biden administration is doing in helping schools return to in-person instruction, with 38% disapproving and one in five unsure or offering no opinion.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi says the Biden administration inherited a &#39;broken system&#39; at the southern border.
Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., channeled the movie &#34;Billy Madison&#34; Monday on 
&#34;Fox &amp; Friends&#34;
 as he hit back at House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
, D-Calif., for claiming that the Biden administration inherited a broken 
immigration
 system from former President 
Donald Trump
. 
Pelosi pointed fingers at Trump on Sunday, insinuating that he’s to blame for the crisis at the 
border
 during an appearance on ABC News’ &#34;This Week&#34; Sunday.
DHS CHIEF DIRECTS FEMA TO ASSIST IN &#39;GOVERNMENT-WIDE EFFORT&#39; TO HOUSE CHILD MIGRANTS AS NUMBERS SURGE
SEN. TOM COTTON: &#34;At no point in that rambling, incoherent answer did Nancy Pelosi even come close to expressing a rational thought. What they inherited was a border that was closed. We were building a wall and turning away all migrants who had no right to cross into our country. 
The Biden border crisis, though, was created by Joe Biden&#39;s promises of amnesty and open borders, free health care for illegals during the campaign. That&#39;s why border crossings have increased every month since the election. 
And now, the Biden administration is sending FEMA to the border. They are, by their own declaration, admitting it&#39;s a disaster. That&#39;s what it is when you deploy FEMA, a disaster. 
But remember, they&#39;re not deploying FEMA to secure the border, to try to finish the wall or to stop those migrants from crossing. They&#39;re deploying FEMA to expedite them, wave them in even fasted, give them a bus ticket, a plane ticket and send them wherever they want to go in the United States. That is the Biden border crisis.&#34;

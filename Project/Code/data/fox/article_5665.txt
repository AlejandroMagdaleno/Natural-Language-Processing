Fox Nation host reacts to controversies surrounding the New York governor on ‘Outnumbered.’ 
New York
 Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 
apologized on Wednesday
 following allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior by three women, but he fell short of resigning -- prompting pushback from critics as well as his accusers. 
He&#39;s &#34;embarrassed&#34; by his actions and will cooperate with the New York Attorney General&#39;s investigation of his conduct, the governor said, while also stressing he &#34;never touched anyone inappropriately.&#34;
Cuomo is facing mounting calls for his resignation, an independent investigation and a move to rescind his emergency coronavirus powers amid dueling scandals over allegations of 
improper behavior
 toward women and his handling of the 
nursing home
 crisis during the 
pandemic
.
Former Cuomo aide 
Lindsey Boylan
, 36, has 
accused the governor
 of unwanted touching and kissing. After her bombshell essay on 
Medium
, another former aide, Charlotte Bennett, 
also came forward
 with sexual harassment allegations, claiming she was 25 years old at the time. A third woman with no workplace ties to the governor, Anna Ruch, accused him this week of making unwanted sexual advances and touching her at a 2019 wedding.

Cuomo said in a 
statement issued Sunday
 that some of the things he&#39;s said in the past &#34;have been misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation.&#34; Cuomo&#39;s office has also denied Boylan&#39;s harassment claims, calling them &#34;simply false.&#34;
Lawmakers have called for independent 
investigations
 and the resignation of Cuomo, 63, including 
several members of the Democratic party

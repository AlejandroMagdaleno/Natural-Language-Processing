Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers defends the curriculum on &#39;The Story.&#39;
A group of 
GOP senators
 is demanding answers from the 
Biden
 administration on how powerful teachers unions may have influenced school reopening guidelines as 
coronavirus
 cases declined. 
The senators say the &#34;close coordination&#34; between the teachers unions and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on drafting language on school reopening guidelines &#34;raises serious concern&#34; about the &#34;scientific integrity&#34; of the underlying guidance.  
They point to 
recently uncovered emails
 between the CDC and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the National Education Association (NEA) that show union officials were involved in the development of the new school guidelines released on Feb. 12.
&#34;Recently released emails show close coordination between the CDC and teachers unions on the language of school reopening guidance,&#34; the senators 
wrote Wednesday in a letter
 to the leaders of the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). &#34;Political interference from administration-friendly special interest groups that is divorced from science harms children who have been lacking in-person instruction for prolonged periods of time.&#34;

Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rand Paul of Kentucky, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Rick Scott of Florida and Josh Hawley of Missouri joined together on the letter, which was 
first reported by the Daily Caller
. They are asking CDC Director Rochelle Walensky and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra for further details about communications with the AFT and NEA on the school guidelines. 
HOUSE REPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS FROM CDC ON SEEMINGLY COZY RELATIONSHIP WITH TEACHERS UNIONS
The CDC and the White House have defended the contact with the teachers unions on the reopening guidelines as part of a longstanding best practice to consult with many organizations and groups that will implement the rules.
&#34;It’s actually a longstanding best practice for the CDC to engage with organizations and groups that are going to be impacted by guidance and recommendations issued by the agency,&#34; White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said earlier this month.

Psaki said the CDC &#34;engaged with around 50 stakeholders&#34; total in advance of the guidance -- not just the unions.
But Republicans have remained skeptical about the inclusion of teachers unions, which they blame for the slow reopening of certain school districts. Teachers unions are 
major political donors
 to the Democratic Party, including President Joe Biden.  
Currently, about 68% of K-12 public school students are attending class in person every day, according to Burbio.com&#39;s school opening tracker. Just under 3% of students are in virtual-only school, while the rest are in some hybrid model.
MARTHA MACCALLUM SPARS WITH TEACHERS UNION PRESIDENT OVER CRITICAL RACE THEORY IN CLASSROOMS: &#39;THAT&#39;S A DODGE&#39;
In an interview with Fox News&#39; Martha MacCallum earlier this month, AFT President Randi Weingarten said the teachers union supports the full opening of schools now that conditions have changed and the Biden administration issued real safety guidelines that aren&#39;t undermined by the former president on a daily basis.
&#34;The bottom line is it’s time for our kids to be back in school,&#34; Weingarten said. &#34;I am grateful that the Biden administration is listening to parents and to teachers and to administrators and to even Fox to try to figure out how we get people vaccinated, how we get our kids back to school and how we get our country back to being back.&#34;

The union president added: &#34;I begged the Trump administration to do exactly what the Biden administration did, which is real safety guidance that the former president didn’t mock every other day.&#34;
House Republicans 
already wrote the CDC
 for answers about the seemingly cozy relationship with the unions, but the agency had not yet responded to their letter.

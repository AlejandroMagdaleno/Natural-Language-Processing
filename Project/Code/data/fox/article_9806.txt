&#39;Fox News @ Night&#39; panel reacts to the congresswoman comparing the United States and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban
The 
White House
 has remained silent about a bitter feud between House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
, the 
 Democratic
 leadership and Rep. 
Ilhan Omar
 over her recent comments about the U.S. and Israel.
Omar, the two-term progressive representative from Minnesota, has come under fire over her Monday tweet that grouped the U.S. and 
Israel
 along with terror groups such as Hamas and the Taliban. She wrote that all had committed 
&#34;unthinkable atrocities.&#34;
 The tweet drew sharp condemnations from members of both parties. 
TOP DEMS REBUKE ILHAN OMAR FOR US, ISRAEL COMPARISON TO TERRORIST GROUPS: ‘NO MORAL EQUIVALENCY’
Omar later 
walked back
 the comment on Thursday, saying she &#34;was in no way equating terrorist organizations with democratic countries with well-established judicial systems.&#34; 
Following Omar&#39;s explanation, House Democratic leadership 
said in a statement
 that &#34;false equivalencies between democracies like the U.S. and Israel and groups that engage in terrorism like Hamas and the Taliban foments prejudice and undermines progress toward a future of peace and security for all.&#34;
&#34;We welcome the clarification by Congresswoman Omar that there is no moral equivalency between the U.S. and Israel and Hamas and the Taliban,&#34; the statement continued.
But that didn&#39;t put an end to the matter. 
DEM INFIGHTING REACHES NEW LEVEL AFTER OMAR CALLS COLLEAGUES’ CRITICISM ‘ISLAMOPHOBIC’
Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan tore into her party&#39;s leadership following the release of the statement Thursday afternoon. Tlaib, who has her own 
history of controversial remarks
, said Democratic leaders &#34;should be ashamed&#34; of their treatment of Omar and other &#34;Congresswomen of color.&#34; 
The second term congresswoman wrote, &#34;Freedom of speech doesn&#39;t exist for Muslim women in Congress. The benefit of the doubt doesn&#39;t exist for Muslim women in Congress. House Democratic leadership should be ashamed of its relentless, exclusive tone policing of Congresswomen of color.&#34; 
Omar also saw her colleagues from 
&#34;The Squad&#34;
 – a  small group of new progressive House members –  Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Missouri&#39;s Rep. Cori Bush also leveled sharp criticisms at their party&#39;s leaders on Thursday. 
&#34;Pretty sick &amp; tired of the constant vilification, intentional mischaracterization, and public targeting of [Omar] coming from our caucus,&#34; 
Ocasio-Cortez tweeted
. &#34;They have no concept for the danger they put her in by skipping private conversations &amp; leaping to fueling targeted news cycles around her.&#34;
Bush 
accused
 members of her own party of &#34;anti-Blackness and Islamophobia.&#34; 
&#34;Stop attacking [Omar]. Stop attacking us,&#34; Bush said. &#34;I&#39;m not surprised when Republicans attack Black women for standing up for human rights. But when it&#39;s Democrats, it&#39;s especially hurtful. We&#39;re your colleagues. Talk to us directly. Enough with the anti-Blackness and Islamophobia.&#34;
Meanwhile, the White House has so far remained silent on the brewing civil war between &#34;The Squad&#34; and Democratic congressional leadership. Press officials did not respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment on the ongoing feud. President Biden is currently on a 
diplomatic trip
 to Europe. 
While Omar&#39;s fellow 
&#34;Squad&#34;
 members have rallied to her defense, her original tweet 
drew criticism
 from roughly a dozen House Democrats, all whom of are Jewish.

&#34;Equating the United States and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban is as offensive as it is misguided,&#34; the group of Democrats said in the statement. Signees included Reps. Brad Schneider, D-Ill.; Brad Sherman, D-Calif.; Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J.; Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass.; and Ted Deutch, D-Fla.
Sherman also 
issued
 his own, standalone release torching Omar for her &#34;outrageous and clearly false statements&#34; against America and Israel and quipping that what was &#34;newsworthy&#34; was &#34;that she admits Hamas is guilty of ‘unthinkable atrocities.’&#34;

In his forthcoming book &#34;Beautiful Things,&#34; 
Hunter Biden
 delves into his struggles with 
addiction
, including a dramatic intervention that his family staged for him in March 2019.
The son of 
President Biden
 first revealed some details of the episode -- which happened about one month before the elder Biden announced his presidential campaign -- during an interview clip with &#34;CBS This Morning&#34; released Friday. But a copy of &#34;Beautiful Things&#34; obtained by Fox News includes more on the incident, including the lead-up to it and what Hunter did afterward. 
HUNTER BIDEN CLAIMS HE DOESN&#39;T KNOW IF LAPTOP IS HIS, REVEALS FATHER ONCE CHASED HIM DURING DRUG INTERVENTION
&#34;One day out of the blue,&#34; Hunter wrote, &#34;my mother called.&#34;
She said that there would be a &#34;family dinner at the house, that I should come, even stay in Delaware for a few days,&#34; the book reads. Hunter Biden, who was at a motel at the time, left for Wilmington, according to the book.
&#34;I walked into the house, bright and homey as always, and immediately saw my three daughters. I knew then that something was up,&#34; he said. &#34;Naomi had come in from New York, where she was in law school at Columbia; Finnegan came in from Philadelphia, where she was at Penn; and Maisy, then a high school senior, had come over from Kathleen&#39;s house in Washington.&#34;

Hunter then spotted two rehab counselors that he recognized from previous attempts to get clean, he wrote. &#34;&#39;Not a chance,&#39;&#34; Hunter said, according to the book. 
&#34;&#39;I don&#39;t know what else to do,&#39;&#34; President Biden, then on the verge of announcing his candidacy, said according to his son. &#34;&#39;I&#39;m so scared. Tell me what to do.&#34;
&#34;&#39;Not f------ this,&#39;&#34; Hunter says he replied.

HUNTER SAYS HE BEGAN RELATIONSHIP WITH LATE BROTHER’S WIDOW WHEN SHE WAS AT HER ‘NEEDIEST&#39;
&#34;It was awful... I was awful,&#34; he added. 
The situation, Hunter wrote, was an &#34;agonized debacle&#34; for some time before he told his father to never &#34;&#39;ambush me like this again&#39;&#34; and attempted to run out of the house. 
His daughters blocked him from getting into his car, Hunter wrote, and his father exited the house to hug him and &#34;cried for the longest time.&#34;
Asked by CBS what was going through his mind at that moment, Hunter said: &#34;I thought, ‘I need to figure out a way to tell him that I’m going to do something so that I can go take another hit.&#39;&#34;

&#34;It’s the only thing I could think. Literally,&#34; he added. &#34;That’s how powerful. I don’t know of a force more powerful than my family’s love. Except addiction.&#34;
Hunter, according to his book, agreed to be taken to a local rehab center by Hallie Biden, his brother Beau&#39;s widow with whom he&#39;d had a romantic relationship in the past. But after she dropped him off at the rehab center, Hunter got an Uber to a hotel near BWI Airport. &#34;I sat in my room and smoked the crack I&#39;d tucked away in my traveling bag,&#34; wrote.
&#34;I then boarded a plane for California and ran and ran and ran.&#34;

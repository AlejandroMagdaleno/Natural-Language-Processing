&#39;We don&#39;t have a resource problem, we have a luck problem,&#39; Surfside mayor Charles Burkett tells &#39;Fox &amp; Friends Weekend&#39;

And she added that FEMA’s seeking &#34;to identify any federal support that&#39;s needed&#34; as first responders &#34;work around the clock on response and recovery efforts.&#34;
DeSantis on Thursday declared a state of emergency in Miami-Dade County, shortly after the building collapse of the Champlain Towers South. The governor’s move cleared the way for 
President Biden
 on Friday morning to approve emergency aid from FEMA, which is sending technical experts and staff to support the recovery effort. FEMA added that three urban search and rescue teams are also poised to help.
Biden emphasized on Friday said his administration was doing everything in its power to assist the response efforts. &#34;It&#39;s a tough, tough time. There&#39;s so many people waiting. Are they alive, will they be, what&#39;ll happen? And so our heart goes out to them,&#34; Biden said.

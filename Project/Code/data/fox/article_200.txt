Multiple corporations that gave tens of thousands of dollars to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) have remained silent on whether they support House Democrats&#39; attempt to overturn Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks’, R-Iowa, state-certified win.

&#34;After losing 13 seats in the 2020 election, House Democrats have a numbers problem and are trying to grab a House seat in Iowa to fix it,&#34; wrote Pence. &#34;Despite a Bipartisan group of election officials in Iowa voting 5-0 to certify Mariannette [Miller-Meeks] after a recount.&#34;

Russian President Vladimir Putin
 has signed a decree allowing the country to limit the number of 
Russians
 employed at embassies of countries determined to be unfriendly, or to ban their employment entirely.
The measure, announced by the Kremlin on Friday, comes amid a flurry of expulsions of 
Russian
 diplomats from the 
United States
 and European countries and Moscow’s retaliatory expulsions.

The Czech Republic last week expelled 18 
Russian
 envoys they labeled as spies, prompting Russia to send 20 Czech diplomats home. That devastated Czech Embassy operations in

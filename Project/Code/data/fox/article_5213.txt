FOX News contributor tells &#39;The Story&#39; why the idea is a &#39;failure&#39; on the part of Joe Biden
Legislation to expand the 
Supreme Court
 proposed by House and Senate Democrats represents &#34;a crisis of leadership and a failure on the part of 
President Biden
,&#34; George Washington University law professor and Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley told &#34;
The Story
&#34; Thursday.
&#34;He [Biden] equivocated throughout the campaign, he didn&#39;t want to admit that he viewed court-packing, 
as he did in 1983, as a
 
bone-headed idea
, a dangerous idea,&#34; Turley told host Martha MacCallum. &#34;Instead he fueled these demands to simply change the court so it would effectively carry out a more liberal agenda.&#34;
&#34;We need a president to say,  &#39;This is enough. This is pure and raw court-packing,&#39;&#34; Turley continued. &#34;The public has been always against court-packing. The polls are very high. They&#39;ve never been equivocating in their own right. The public sees it for what it is. Liberal justices have opposed this. This is called a hostile takeover of the Supreme Court against the wishes of the public, even liberal justices, and against the weight of history.&#34;
MacCallum recalled that the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg threw cold water on the idea of court-packing when she stated in 2019: &#34;If anything that would make the court appear partisan. It would be that -- one side saying, &#39;When we&#39;re in power, we’re going to enlarge the number of justices so we’ll have more people who will vote the way we want them to.&#39; So I&#39;m not at all in favor of that solution to what I see as a temporary situation.&#34;

Turley then pointed out that many  of the liberal lawmakers who opposed former President Donald Trump&#39;s nominees to the Supreme Court have been wrong.
&#34;Gorsuch and Kavanaugh have voted on critical cases with the left more than the justices on the left have broken away [and voted] with the right. This court is not as robotic as people suggest.&#34;

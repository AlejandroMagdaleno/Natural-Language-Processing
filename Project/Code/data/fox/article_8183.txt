Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., tells ‘Fox News Sunday’ why he voted against the $1.9 trillion stimulus. He also argues it is ‘unmistakable’ that Biden’s policies are driving the surge of migrants at the border.
Sen. 
Bill Cassidy
, R-La., blames 
President Biden
 for the surge of migrants that have presented a crisis at the U.S. southern border.
February saw the largest number of unaccompanied minors apprehended at the border since May 2019. &#34;
Fox News Sunday
&#34; host Chris Wallace asked Cassidy to what degree Biden&#39;s policies have caused this.

&#34;Empirically it is entirely. You can&#39;t help but notice that the administration changes and there is a surge,&#34; Cassidy said.
The senator recalled hearing one of Biden&#39;s advisers said in Spanish that the border was not closed, only to then say in English that she misspoke.
&#34;I can tell you the Spanish version is being heard, not the English,&#34; he said, claiming that this message emboldens people to send their children, even if it means putting them at risk.
&#34;And so when people think they can get in,&#34; Cassidy claimed, &#34;they begin sending their unaccompanied child on a trainride across Mexico where she may be kidnapped and trafficked, on the hope that they&#39;re going to be waved through at the border.&#34;
The Biden administration has refused to characterize the situation at the border as a &#34;crisis,&#34; despite calling on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to support a &#34;
government-wide effort
&#34; to house child migrants as numbers continue to spike.

Cassidy said this is evidence that the administration expects the number of unaccompanied children to continue to grow.
&#34;They&#39;re sending FEMA for reinforcements -- not for today, not for tomorrow, but for three weeks from now,&#34; he said.

Earlier in the interview, Cassidy addressed the issues he has with the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that the Senate passed earlier this month. He asserted that there is too much money going towards goals that are not really about pandemic relief.
&#34;The money that is there for education will be spent in the out years,&#34; the senator explained. &#34;That&#39;s not related to COVID. If everybody is vaccinated by June then it&#39;s clearly not related to COVID.&#34;
Cassidy also said that while he and other Republicans support stimulus payments &#34;for people who needed it,&#34; the Democrats&#39; bill does much more than that. He noted that stimulus checks are going to people including inmates who do not stimulate the economy and who are already supported by taxpayers.

&#34;That&#39;s the sort of thing that should not be included,&#34; he said.
As for small businesses, Cassidy claimed that there is still enough money from the last relief bill to go towards the Paycheck Protection Program.
&#34;The dollars are there now for the need which is there now,&#34; he said.

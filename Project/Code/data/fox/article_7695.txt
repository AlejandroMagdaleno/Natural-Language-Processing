Fox News contributor Karl Rove reacts to Democrats’ efforts to block the passage of Republican-backed voting legislation.
Texas Rep. Beth Van Duyne called out Democrats in her state for fleeing to Washington, D.C. to avoid voting on an election integrity law and accused them of failing to fulfill their duties as public servants.
&#34;While these Democrats are jetting around, drinking beer, and contracting COVID, we’ve been busy connecting thousands of North Texans with jobs for their futures,&#34; Van Duyne, a Republican, told Fox News after it was revealed that at least three of the fleeing Democrats 
contracted the coronavirus

TEXAS DEMOCRATS ARE &#39;LYING&#39; ABOUT VOTING RIGHTS BILL, POSITIVE COVID TESTS A &#39;GIMMICK,&#39; STATE REP SAYS
The group of Democrats had previously posed for a picture on a private plane on the way to the nation’s capital without wearing masks, which many, including Van Duyne, labeled as hypocritical given their previous positions on coronavirus restrictions.
&#34;Dems agree we no longer need masks on planes,&#34; she tweeted this week in response to the photo. &#34;Time to remove mandate for the rest of us.

HANS VON SPAKOVSKY: TEXAS DEMOCRATS&#39; OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS ABOUT ELECTION REFORMS HAVE NO CONNECTION TO REALITY
In another tweet, Van Duyne accused the Democrats of dereliction of duty.
It is unclear when the group of Democrats will return to Austin to allow the quorum vote on the bill to take place. Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan announced earlier this week that he charted a plane from Washington to Texas and urged his colleagues to secure their seats as soon as possible.

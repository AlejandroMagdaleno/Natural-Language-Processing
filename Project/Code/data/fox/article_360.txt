&#39;The American people want a better America, not a different America,&#39; Trey Gowdy said on &#39;Sunday Night in America&#39;
Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y., and other members of the far-left &#34;
Squad
&#34; collectively spent nearly $100,000 on private security in the third financial quarter despite promoting the defund the 
police
 movement, according to FEC records reviewed by Fox News. 
Ocasio-Cortez&#39;s campaign spent over $10,000 on private policing with Cest Bond Collective, Three Bridges NY LLC and Tullis World Wide Protection, eclipsing Rep. Ayanna Pressley&#39;s, D-Mass., personal security bill of almost $4,000 with Ware Security Consultants Inc., FEC records show. 
‘DEFUND THE POLICE’ ADVOCATE CORI BUSH DROPS ANOTHER $65,000 INTO PRIVATE SECURITY SERVICES
The Bronx congresswoman has been a staunch advocate of defunding law enforcement, while Pressley 
said
 she stood &#34;ready to continue the systemic work necessary to radically reimagine a system of public safety in our country that finally censures the dignity and humanity of all.&#34;
Both Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley are dwarfed in their security spending, though, by Reps. 
Ilhan Omar
, D-Minn., and Cori Bush, D-Mo.
Omar’s FEC records revealed the defund law enforcement advocate has spent over $22,000 on private security with Aegis Logistics LLC and Lloyd Security Services while Bush took the cake by throwing down another $65,000 on private security.
The Minnesota Democrat called the Minneapolis Police Department &#34;rotten to the root&#34; in June of last year.
ILHAN OMAR, KEITH ELLISON SUPPORT BALLOT MEASURE TO REPLACE MINNEAPOLIS POLICE DEPARTMENT
 
&#34;What we are saying is the current infrastructure that exists as policing in our city should not exist anymore, and we can’t go about creating a different process with the same infrastructure in place,&#34; Omar said at the time.
Bush’s campaign spent $64,141.26 on private security between the beginning of July and late September, the Federal Election Commission records show. The cash was dished out to a handful of firms, including Peace Security, RS&amp;T Security Consulting, Aegis Logistics, Whole Armor Executive Protection &amp; Security and Nathaniel Davis, whose payments are sent to the same address as her campaign headquarters.

Additionally, the hiring of private police was paid for by the campaigns — meaning donor dollars that likely supported the &#34;Squad&#34; members’ calls to defund police are now being used to rent private police.
None of the congresswomen’s campaigns immediately responded to Fox News’ requests for comment.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on prepping tax hikes to fuel the next spending plan.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Thursday defended 
President Biden
&#39;s sprawling economic spending measure, even though just a fraction of the $2 trillion being billed as an 
infrastructure
 package goes toward rebuilding the nation&#39;s crumbling roads and bridges.
&#34;We&#39;re talking about roads and bridges, we&#39;re talking about rail and transit, we&#39;re talking about airports, we&#39;re talking about the grid,&#34; Buttigieg said during an interview on &#34;
America&#39;s Newsroom
.&#34; &#34;I don&#39;t know why anybody would say it&#39;s a mistake to invest in the grid after what we just witnessed in Texas.&#34;
WHAT&#39;S IN BIDEN&#39;S $2.2T INFRASTRUCTURE AND TAX PROPOSAL?
Biden unveiled the first part of his infrastructure proposal — dubbed the American Jobs Plan — on Wednesday, laying out a $2.25 trillion, eight-year spending plan that will be paid for by raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% and increasing the global minimum tax on U.S. corporations to 21% from 13%.
The plan calls for $621 billion in new spending on roads, bridges, rail, ports, waterways, airports, public transportation and electric vehicles.
Just $115 billion, or roughly 5.6% of total spending, would go toward modernizing 20,000 miles of highways, roads and main streets that are &#34;in most critical need of repair,&#34; as well as repairing the most &#34;economic significant large bridges&#34; and roughly 10,000 smaller bridges, according to a fact sheet released by the White House. 
PROGRESSIVES PRESSURE BIDEN TO PASS $10T GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE, CLIMATE JUSTICE BILL
The proposal also includes hundreds of billions of dollars for a slew of other initiatives, including $111 billion to rebuild the nation&#39;s water infrastructure, $100 billion to create new public schools and upgrade existing buildings, $213 billion to design more than 2 million affordable homes, $400 billion to bolster caregiving for elderly and disabled Americans, $174 billion to invest in electric vehicles and $100 billion to bring high-speed broadband internet to all Americans.

&#34;It&#39;s time to prepare for the future,&#34; Buttigieg said. &#34;The millions of jobs that will be created by this bill are because this bill looks to the future.&#34;
Still, the administration faces an enormous challenge in getting Congress to pass the multi-part infrastructure package, which will serve as the basis of Biden&#39;s &#34;Build Back Better&#34; plan.
BIDEN CORPORATE TAX HIKE COULD SHRINK US ECONOMY, SLASH JOBS
&#34;Since infrastructure really is a bipartisan priority, we&#39;d love nothing more than to have a bipartisan vote on this in Washington,&#34; Buttigieg said.
But Republicans have already started to attack the White House&#39;s proposal, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday skewering it as a &#34;trojan horse&#34; for major tax hikes. At the same time, a group of moderate Democrats have signaled they will not support the bill – imperiling its passage – unless their party agrees to restore unlimited write-offs of state and local taxes, or SALT.
Repealing the $10,000 limit, however, would require Democrats to vote for something that&#39;s widely viewed as a tax cut for the wealthy in blue states like New Jersey and New York.

Progressive Democrats have also criticized the size and scope of the proposal, arguing that it doesn&#39;t go far enough in addressing climate change or other issues. 
&#34;This is not nearly enough,&#34; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted on Tuesday. &#34;The important context here is that it’s $2.25T spread out over 10 years.&#34;

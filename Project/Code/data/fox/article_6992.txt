House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 said Thursday that President 
Biden
&#39;s first joint address to 
Congress
 is contingent on 
coronavirus
 capacity concerns at the Capitol.
Presidents traditionally give a speech in the crowded House chamber during their first year in office -- often in February. An address to a joint session of Congress is like a State of the Union, though it is not called that until the president&#39;s second year in office. 
But so far, neither the White House nor Pelosi has announced plans for Biden to give the address despite signaling he would do so after the passage of his $1.9 trillion 
coronavirus
 relief package, which 
he signed into law
 on March 11.
BIDEN SPEECH TO CONGRESS STILL NOT SCHEDULED DESPITE WHITE HOUSE PLEDGE FOR POST-COVID BILL DATE
Wehn asked about the timing Thursday during her weekly press conference, Pelosi said &#34;of course&#34; she&#39;d be inviting Biden to speak &#34;soon&#34; before Congress, but said, &#34;part of the decision in that regard is in the hands of the capital physician, as well as the Sergeants at Arms.&#34;
PELOSI HIRES DC NATIONAL GUARD CHIEF TO LEAD HOUSE SECURITY
Pelosi noted this would be the first joint address to Congress since coronavirus because former President Donald Trump&#39;s last State of the Union was in February before the pandemic hit. (Pelosi also brought up her 2020 post-speech 
theatric gesture
, reminding reporters it was &#34;when I tore up the speech -- the pack of lies.&#34;)
PELOSI RALLIES BEHIND NEWSOM, SAYS IT&#39;S &#39;UNNECESSARY&#39; TO RUN ANOTHER DEM IN CALIFORNIA RECALL
This time around, Pelosi said there are concerns about having a safe capacity at the Capitol and that may be dependent on how many lawmakers are vaccinated.
&#34;Whatever the number, we&#39;ll be ready whenever the president is ready to come,&#34; Pelosi said Thursday.

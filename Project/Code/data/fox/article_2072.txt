Oregon&#39;s Department of Education is urging teachers to take training on how white supremacy culture infiltrates math; Army veteran Jeremy Hunt says the move &#39;defies all logic&#39; on &#39;Fox &amp;amp; Friends.&#39;
Buffalo
 schools have adopted a curriculum that pushes controversial ideas about 
race
, such as that all white people perpetuate systemic racism.
The school district&#39;s training and curriculum gained renewed attention on Tuesday when Discovery Institute researcher Chris Rufo reported on a whistleblower&#39;s comments.
According to Rufo, the whistleblower claimed that Dr. Fatima Morell, who serves as associate superintendent for Culturally and Linguistically Responsive Initiatives, has been pushing &#34;radical politics.&#34;
In practice, that has translated into &#34;scoldings, guilt-trips, and demands to demean oneself simply to make another feel ‘empowered,&#39;&#34; according to the whistleblower, whom Rufo described as a veteran teacher. 
OREGON PROMOTES TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAM THAT SEEKS TO UNDO &#39;RACISM IN MATHEMATICS&#39;
One of the district&#39;s instructional materials also 
includes
 the assertion that &#34;all white people play a part in perpetuating systemic racism.&#34;
Fox News previously reported on Buffalo&#39;s embrace of a &#34;Black Lives Matter&#34; curriculum that taught students to question the nuclear family structure.
The lesson plans, obtained by 
&#34;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#34;
 and prepared by the Buffalo Public Schools’ Office of Culturally and Linguistically Responsive Initiatives, instruct teachers to discuss various &#34;guiding principles&#34; with students including &#34;Black Villages,&#34; which they describe as &#34;the disruption of Western nuclear family dynamics and a return to the ‘collective village’ that takes care of each other.&#34; The school system took the lesson plans offline last year, but Fox News retained and reuploaded copies.
Rufo&#39;s whistleblower echoed others across the country who have complained about the growing trend of critical race theory or so-called &#34;anti-racist&#34; curricula in U.S. institutions.
Earlier this month, Fox News reported on the Oregon Department of Education promoting a teacher training program that sought to undo &#34;racism in mathematics.&#34; It argues, among other things, that White supremacy manifests itself in the focus on finding the right answer.
Anti-racism curricula have received an array of criticism and support.
For example, political scientist Carol M. Swain previously 
told
 Fox News&#39; Laura Ingraham that certain curricula &#34;put forth by Black Lives Matter and being embraced in too many places is really destructive of the Black community and the Black family and racial justice.&#34;

Angela Onwuachi-Willig, an expert on critical race theory at Boston University School of Law, told the 
Boston Globe
 that critical race theory helped people understand the complexity of race – beyond &#34;simple&#34; narratives that they may have been taught.
&#34;Racism is not extraordinary,&#34; she continued. &#34;Race and racism are basically baked into everything we do in our society. It’s embedded in our institutions. It’s embedded in our minds and hearts.&#34;
Neither Morell nor the Buffalo school district responded to a request for comment.

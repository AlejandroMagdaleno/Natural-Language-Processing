EXCLUSIVE
 - The 
Democratic
 Congressional Campaign Committee&#39;s new chief technical officer, Erica Joy Baker, has a history of anti-
police
 tweets including posts that say, &#34;I hate the police&#34; and comparing police officers to a &#34;modern day slave patrol.&#34; 
NEWLY APPOINTED DCCC ADVISER DELETES TWEETS SLAMMING BIDEN AND HARRIS
&#34;[I] wonder if this will kick off an investigation into how deeply white nationalists have infiltrated capitol police, which will spur similar investigations into other [police departments],&#34; Baker wrote on 
Twitter
 on Jan. 11 after two Capitol Police officers were 
suspended
.
DCCC Chair Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney 
announced
 the organization hired Baker as its first-ever chief technical officer on Monday.
&#34;These new additions to the DCCC are seasoned operatives who know what it takes to win,&#34; Maloney said in a statement. &#34;I am thrilled to welcome these talented operatives on board, and I look forward to our continued work as we assemble the team that will protect Democrats’ House majority in 2022.&#34;
Baker has tweeted &#34;
f--- 12
,&#34; an alternative phrase to &#34;f--- the police,&#34; multiple times. 
&#34;I hate the police. The institution of policing, with it&#39;s history of criminalizing and weaponizing blackness, is a farce. And I hate it,&#34; she wrote on 
Twitter
 on Sept. 20, 2016.
&#34;F--- this institution founded on the capture and killing of black bodies, this modern day slave patrol we call the police,&#34; she wrote on 
Twitter
 on April 19, 2016.
Baker has previously worked at Google, Slack, Microsoft and GitHub, according to the DCCC. 
In February, Maloney 
defended
 Dyjuan Tatro, a former gang member who recently joined the DCCC, as an &#34;extraordinary individual&#34; after backlash to some of Tatro&#39;s anti-police tweets.
Tatro, the DCCC&#39;s new senior adviser for strategic outreach, referred to police officers as &#34;
white supremacists
&#34; after the storming of the Capitol in January and condoned looting in the wake of the death of 
George Floyd

&#34;It&#39;s a pretty extraordinary individual you&#39;re talking about,&#34; Maloney said when asked about Tatro during a 
Politico interview
. &#34;You&#39;re talking about deleted tweets that were before we hired him.&#34;
One of the tweets that landed Tatro in hot water came just weeks before the DCCC announced his new role.
&#34;The answer to white supremacists storming the Capitol is not to give more money to a different group of white supremacists who&#39;s [sic] job it is to uphold white supremacy,&#34; Tatro 
wrote
 in a now-deleted Twitter thread about the Capitol Police budget on Jan. 8.

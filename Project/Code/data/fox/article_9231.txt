A third woman accuses N.Y. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment. Attorney Remi Spencer reacts.
Donald Trump Jr.
 called out the publishers of New York Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
&#39;s book on leadership during the coronavirus pandemic, asking if they will cut ties with the Democrat as he navigates his way through scandals.
First, Cuomo faced calls to have emergency powers stripped over his administration’s handling of nursing homes during the pandemic and their ensuing effort to withhold the number of nursing home residents who died from COVID-19. Then, multiple women came forward with allegations of sexual harassment.
NY GOV. ANDREW CUOMO ACCUSED BY THIRD WOMAN OF UNWANTED SEXUAL ADVANCES
&#34;With everything that is coming to light, when will @CrownPublishing be cancelling @andrewcuomo&#39;s contract?&#34; Trump tweeted Monday night.
The former president&#39;s son then claimed that only conservatives get canceled, pointing to Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., whose book deal with Simon &amp; Schuster was canceled after he objected to electoral votes for President Biden on Jan. 6.

Fox News reached out to Crown Publishing for comment, but they did not immediately respond.

Cuomo began facing criticism from his own party after a member of his administration admitted that they intentionally withheld statistics of nursing home deaths. The opposition only intensified after multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.

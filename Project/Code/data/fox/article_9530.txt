Fox News chief congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on the killing of Ofc. William Evans, on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Officer 
William &#34;Billy&#34; F. Evans
, who died on Good Friday while 
defending the Capitol
, will lie in honor at the Capitol Rotunda on April 13, congressional leaders announced Tuesday.
Evans, an 18-year veteran of the United States Capitol Police force, was 41 years old. He was a father of two children and a native of North Adams, Mass.
&#34;Billy was the best father, son, brother, and friend anyone could ever hope for,&#34; Evans&#39; family said in a new statement Tuesday. &#34;His death has left a gaping void in our lives that will never be filled.&#34;
Evans 
was killed Friday
 when a vehicle driven by Noah Green, 25, crashed into a barricade protecting the Capitol and rammed into Evans and another officer. Green purportedly came out of the car with a knife and was shot to death by police. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., praised Evans&#39; heroics Tuesday when announcing the arrangements to honor him at the Capitol.
FALLEN CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER: WHO IS WILLIAM &#39;BILLY&#39; EVANS, REMEMBERED AS &#39;ALL-AMERICAN KID,&#39; DEDICATED DAD?
&#34;In giving his life to protect our Capitol and our country, Officer Evans became a martyr for our democracy,&#34; Pelosi and Schumer said in a joint statement. &#34;On behalf of the entire Congress, we are profoundly grateful.&#34;
Lying in honor is one step below lying in state at the Rotunda, which is typically reserved for presidents and elected officials. Evans will be the fourth Capitol police officer to lie in honor in history.
Most recently, Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick, who died from injuries resulting from the 
Jan. 6 riot
 at the Capitol, was honored at the Rotunda in February. 
CAPITOL POLICE IDENTIFY OFFICER KILLED IN ATTACK
A ceremonial arrival for Evans will be at 10:30 a.m. April 13 at the East Front of the U.S. Capitol, followed by a congressional tribute at 11 a.m. Attendance will be limited due to coronavirus restrictions.

      Capitol Police Officer William &#34;Billy&#34; Evans died Friday when an attacker with a knife lunged toward authorities, officials said.

A viewing period for members of the Capitol Police and Congress will follow before the 6:30 p.m. departure ceremony at the Capitol. 
&#34;It is our hope that this tribute will be a comfort to the family of Officer Evans, particularly his children Logan and Abigail, as will the knowledge that so many Americans mourn with and pray for them at this sad time,&#34; Pelosi and Schumer said.

Evans&#39; family said he was proud to be a police officer and cherished his friendships forged at the North Barricade.
But most importantly, Evans loved being a father. 
&#34;The absolute most important thing in his life was his two children, Logan and Abigail,&#34; the family statement said. &#34;His most cherished moments were those spent with them -- building with Lego[s], having lightsaber duels, playing board games, doing arts and crafts, and recently finishing the Harry Potter series.
&#34;He was always so eager to show how proud he was of everything they did,&#34; the statement continued. &#34;Any opportunity to spend time with his children brightened both their lives and his. Their dad was their hero long before the tragic events of last week.&#34;
In addition to Evans and Sicknick, Officer Jacob J. Chestnut Jr. and Detective John M. Gibson have lain in honor at the Capitol, in 1998. Two other civilians were also given this distinction: Rosa Parks in 2005 and the Rev. Billy Graham in 2018.

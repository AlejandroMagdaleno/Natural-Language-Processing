Former Detroit police chief tells &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39; why he launched a gubernatorial exploratory committee
Michigan
 state Rep. Jewell Jones, a 
Democrat
, is defending spending hundreds of campaign dollars at a strip club earlier this year in what he described as a &#34;meeting&#34; that deserved no further explanation.
Jones, who was 
elected
 in 2016 as the youngest representative in state history, reported spending $221 of his campaign funds on March 8 at the Pantheion Club, a gentlemen’s club in Dearborn, according to his campaign 
finance
 report 
reviewed
 Monday by The Detroit News.
MICHIGAN STATE REP APPEARS TO CHEER BILL COSBY RELEASE AS A &#39;GOOD DAY&#39;
Jones explained to the outlet that the club had a &#34;lounge&#34; atmosphere and &#34;great lamb chops,&#34; and that he has to &#34;meet people where they&#39;re at&#34; sometimes as part of his job.
&#34;No need to explain the transactions,&#34; he separately 
told
 WDIV-TV. &#34;I noticeably picked up the tab at these meetings. Got to meet the people where they’re at.&#34;
According to the disclosure, Jones spent more than $6,400 this year at restaurants and lounges for what he described as &#34;meetings,&#34; including $696 at Ferraro&#39;s Italian Restaurant &amp; Wine Bar in Las Vegas on March 22, The Detroit News reported.
&#34;While this sort of spending isn&#39;t uncommon, sadly, the venue Rep. Jones chose truly pushes the limit of credulity,&#34; Simon Schuster, executive director of the nonprofit Michigan Campaign Finance Network, told the outlet.

charged
 with drunk driving and he allegedly threatened officers with a phone call to &#34;Big Gretch,&#34; referring to Democratic Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer
, during his arrest. His next hearing in the case is scheduled for August.

appeared
 to cheer the release of

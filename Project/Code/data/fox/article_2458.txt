NEW YORK (AP) — Cindy McCain, widow of the late Sen. John McCain, will have a memoir out this spring.
Forum, a Penguin Random House imprint, announced Tuesday that McCain&#39;s &#34;Stronger: Courage, Hope, and Humor In My Life With John McCain&#34; will be released April 27. Forum is calling the book an &#34;intimate memoir&#34; in which McCain will reflect on her 38-year marriage to the Arizona Republican, who died in 2018.

Writing ‘Stronger’ at this time was important to me, and I’m excited to share the full story of our life together.&#34;

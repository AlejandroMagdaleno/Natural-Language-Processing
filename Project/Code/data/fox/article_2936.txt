CEO of &#39;The Partnership&#39; Kathryn Wylde warns against the state increases.
Governor Cuomo
 repealed a controversial law that shielded 
nursing homes
 and other essential businesses from 
coronavirus
-related lawsuits Tuesday night.
The measure rolled back the &#34;Emergency or Disaster Treatment Protection Act,&#34; which granted health care facilities and workers liability immunity from negligence suits, and comes as Cuomo’s administration is under federal investigation for covering up some 9,000 COVID-19 related nursing home deaths last year.
The scandal — exclusively revealed by The Post — weakened Cuomo politically and led to calls for him to resign as sexual harassment accusations against him swirled in the wake of the report.
&#34;As we near the passage of this year’s momentous budget, I am relieved to see corporate immunity, which was slipped into last year’s budget, fully repealed,&#34; Bronx State Senator Alessandra Biaggi, one of the bill’s sponsor said in a statement Tuesday night.
GRIEVING FAMILY SAYS CUOMO TO BLAME FOR NURSING HOME CRISIS: &#39;LIKE THEIR LIVES DIDN&#39;T MATTER&#39; 
&#34;This blanket immunity prevented thousands of families who lost loved ones to COVID-19 from seeking legal recourse, and potentially incentivized nursing home executives to cut corners — endangering staff and residents.&#34;
&#34;The corporate immunity provision was a license to kill,&#34; the Democrat previously told The Post
Queens Assemblyman Ron Kim also co-sponsored the bill. Kim — whose uncle died of the coronavirus in a nursing home — said Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, threatened to &#34;destroy&#34; him, if he did not help the governor contain the damage of the death coverup.
&#34;’I can tell the whole world what a bad person you are and you will be finished,’&#34; Kim said the governor told him in February.
The law was passed despite opposition by the powerful Greater New York Hospital Association lobby.

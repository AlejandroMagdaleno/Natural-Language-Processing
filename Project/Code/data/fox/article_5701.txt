Media grapple with Republican rejection
The 
Senate
 trial of former President 
Donald Trump
 is set to begin next week. 
Trump announced a new impeachment legal defense team on Sunday after he parted ways with five of his 
impeachment
 lawyers. 
He will now be represented by trial lawyers David Schoen and Bruce L. Castor, Jr. His former team consisted of South Carolina lawyers Butch Bowers and Deborah Barbier and former federal prosecutors Greg Harris, Johnny Gasser, and Josh Howard, who left by Saturday. 
During his first impeachment trial, Trump&#39;s high-profile team of attorneys included Alan Dershowitz, one of the best-known criminal defense lawyers in the country.
The former president faces charges that he incited the 
insurrection at the U.S. Capitol
 on Jan. 6. His trial begins the week of Feb. 8.

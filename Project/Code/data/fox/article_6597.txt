In media news today: MSNBC remains silent after Rachel Maddow and Joy Reid amplified a false ivermectin overdose story, left-wing media celebrates the Biden admin&#39;s move to oust Trump appointees from military panels and The New York Times defends Gavin Newsom against recall
California Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
 appears to have favorable odds ahead of the state&#39;s recall election next week, according to a 
poll
 released Friday.
The study of likely voters, conducted by the University of California at Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, found that only 38.5% of those surveyed support efforts to recall Newsom, while 60% stated they oppose the move. Of those who took part in the questionnaire, only 1.5% had yet to make up their minds on how to vote in the election.
BIDEN TO CAMPAIGN FOR CALIFORNIA GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM DAY BEFORE RECALL ELECTION
&#34;The findings underscore a significant change in tempo in the state, as decidedly more Californians are attending to the pending election, and are intent on voting no,&#34; IGS Co-Director, G. Cristina Mora said of the study.
A previous 
poll
 from over the summer indicated voters were split on whether to oust the current governor. Forty-seven percent of likely California voters questioned in that poll said they supported recalling Newsom, with 50% opposed.
The recall election, set for Sept. 14 in the Golden State, will allow voters to decide whether to allow Newsom to continue his term as governor or elect a new leader. Larry Elder, a conservative radio host, leads among Republican candidates in the state to defeat Newsom.

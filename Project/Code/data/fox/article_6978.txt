The FOX Business host of &#39;Making Money&#39; sounds off on &#39;Your World&#39;
FOX Business host and author Charles Payne sounded off Thursday on &#34;Your World&#34; against President Biden&#39;s enormous social justice economic spending plan, which is hovering around $1 billion in current negotiations.
SENATE REPUBLICANS UNVEIL $928B COUNTER-OFFER TO BIDEN SPENDING PLAN
CHARLES PAYNE: &#34;I think some people are blown away [by the price tag]. Maybe a few experts are waiting for it. That $6 trillion is sticker shock. Considering that amount is the most we&#39;ve ever spent. That’s the year-over-year increase ever.
…
You know, I think the point has been made that we’ve spent this kind of money in the past or we’ve had emergency spending like this in the past -- but it was emergency. It was short-term: Whether it was World War II, or whether it was right after the great recession or to sort of help with the COVID shutdowns. 
…
This is something different. It comes with a lot of deficits. It comes with more taxes. Comes with things that even the Biden administration, Neil, admits that we’ll have really mediocre GDP growth under this plan. 
…
It’s not an economic plan. It’s a social justice plan. It’s extraordinarily dangerous. It takes us off the rails of what made us amazing to begin with. 
…
We wake up and look and say wow, we’re the greatest country in the world. But it took something to get us here and I don’t think we want to deviate far from that formula.

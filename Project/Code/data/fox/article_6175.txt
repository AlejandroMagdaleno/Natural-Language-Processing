Michigan Republican Sen. Jim Runestad, joined by daughter of nursing home victim Jamie Nicholson, discuss why the Democratic governor should be held accountable for her COVID-19 directive.
Michigan
 Republicans threatened Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer
 with a subpoena Tuesday amid news that Whitmer&#39;s former health department director is set to receive a $155,506 payout after his unexplained resignation in January.
News of the so-called golden parachute for former state health department Director Robert Gordon comes as state Republicans question the Whitmer administration&#39;s numbers about coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.
MICHIGAN GOV. WHITMER&#39;S HEALTH DIRECTOR RECEIVED PAYOUT AMID ABRUPT RESIGNATION: REPORT
&#34;We want to know if what happened in New York, did that happen here? Can you show us that data? They refused to show us the data,&#34; state Rep. Steve Johnson, chair of the Michigan House Oversight Committee, said at a 
press conference
 on Tuesday. &#34;Now, last night we find out that our governor has bought the silence of former Director Gordon with $150,000 of taxpayer money.&#34;

Gordon signed a confidentiality agreement and is set to receive nine months&#39; worth of salary after his sudden resignation in late January, 
The Detroit News
 first reported.
&#34;What I want to know is, what are they hiding?&#34; Johnson said. &#34;We are going to begin an investigation. ... It came to light that it&#39;s not just Director Gordon but his aide as well has one of these agreements. Our office has issued a request for a copy of each agreement.&#34;

&#34;The Oversight Committee will be doing hearings on this matter. We are reaching out to the department, asking them to come forward testify on this matter,&#34; Johnson said. &#34;If we have to do a subpoena, we will.&#34;
Michigan GOP spokesman Ted Goodman accused Whitmer of paying for Gordon&#39;s silence in a statement.
&#34;Gov. Whitmer paid for the silence of the state&#39;s top health official after he abruptly resigned in the middle of a global pandemic,&#34; GOP spokesman Ted Goodman said. &#34;Michiganders deserve to know the circumstances of his resignation, and why he was paid over $150,000 to remain quiet.&#34;

Whitmer previously dodged a question about whether she was behind Gordon&#39;s departure, which was so abrupt it came just eight hours after he had issued an order allowing indoor dining to resume.
&#34;To lead this department in unimaginable circumstances, it has been grueling,&#34; Whitmer said at a Jan. 25 press conference according to The Detroit News. &#34;On behalf of all of the people of Michigan, I want to thank him for his service to our state. He worked hard to protect our public health.&#34;

New Jersey
 
Gov. Phil Murphy
 says the state is considering paying people to get the 
COVID-19
 
vaccine
. 
&#34;We might, I think all things are on the table frankly,&#34; Murphy told 
FOX 5 New York
 in an interview. &#34;We have to get to our objective, which is 70% of the adult population by the end of June.&#34;
NEW JERSEY UNIVERSITY OFFERING STUDENTS UP TO $1,000 COVID VACCINE INCENTIVE
Last week, Murphy launched the &#34;Operation Jersey Summer&#34; campaign, which is aimed at helping the state reach its vaccination goal. 
As part of the campaign, Murphy launched the 
&#34;Shot and a Beer&#34; program
, which will give state residents age 21 years and older a free beer with COVID-19 vaccinations starting in May. The program includes thirteen participating New Jersey-based breweries. 
New Jersey isn&#39;t the only state that has considered offering money as an incentive to be inoculated. Maryland recently 
launched a program that will pay state employees $100 to become fully vaccinated
 and West Virginia announced 
16- to 35-year-olds who get vaccinated can earn a $100 savings bond
.
Murphy&#39;s comments come as the state is set to lift the majority of its capacity restrictions 
beginning May 19
. Businesses will still require patrons to continue to socially distance 6 feet apart.

The governor&#39;s move to place COVID-19 restrictions on businesses earlier this year has appeared to negatively impact his re-election chances in November.
A 
Monmouth University survey 
released last week found that 57% of Garden State voters say they approve of the governor’s performance, with 35% disapproving. That’s down from 71% approval last year. 
There’s an expected partisan divide over Murphy, with 88% of Democrats, 48% of independents, and just 21% of Republicans approving of the job he’s doing as governor.
According to the poll, 48% of voters say the governor should be re-elected this November, with 43% saying it’s time for someone new in office. Again, there’s a partisan split, with 77% of Democrats, 39% of independents, and 15% of Republicans supporting Murphy’s re-election.
&#34;Murphy has a pretty strong job rating going into his reelection bid. However, New Jersey voters are a fickle lot and a good number will sit on the fence until we get closer to the fall campaign in case things go south for the state,&#34; Monmouth University Polling Institute polling director Patrick Murray said.
The Monmouth University Poll was conducted April 29-May 4, with 706 New Jersey adults questioned by telephone. The survey’s overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.
&#34;I frankly don&#39;t spend a minute looking at the polls, honestly,&#34; Murphy told Fox 5 New York. &#34;I wasn&#39;t much of a poll guy before the pandemic, and certainly since this pandemic, I saw the headlines, I am gratified, it looks like more people lean toward favoring what we&#39;re doing than not, but honestly I&#39;ve got my head down trying to do everything I can to save lives, get people back to work, open up businesses, and we&#39;ll let the chips fall where they may.&#34;   
Over 7.9 million COVID-19 doses have been administered in New Jersey, according to the 
latest data from the state&#39;s health department
, with more than 3.5 million people in the state fully vaccinated.

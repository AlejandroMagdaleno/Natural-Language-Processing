President Biden
 on Monday warned his fellow 
Democrats
 that the voting system was under assault and protecting it was the &#34;single most important thing to do.&#34; 
The president delivered those remarks while headlining a virtual fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee Monday evening. His purpose there was to build up resources ahead of next year’s midterm elections when Democrats will be defending the razor-thin majorities in both the 
House
 and the 
Senate
.

&#34;The single most important thing that we have to do is we have to protect the voting system, protect the sacred right to vote,&#34; Biden said from the Executive Residence. &#34;It’s under assault in ways that I haven’t seen in my entire career.&#34;  
Biden blamed the fragile state of the country’s voting system on Republicans, whom he accused of wanting to dictate which votes count.
&#34;It’s outrageous. We’re going to fight like hell so that doesn’t happen,&#34; Biden said. &#34;That’s one of the most important things we can do.&#34;

Biden then turned his sights on the 2022 midterms, imploring Democrats to get their act together, lest their failure to do plays into a Republican victory. 
&#34;We won in 2020 as a unified party. As we look to 2022 … the question the American people are going to be asking is whether we’re helping them and their families and do we understand what they’re going through. Can we deliver?&#34; 
He accused Republicans of offering nothing but &#34;fear and lies and broken promises&#34; and said Democrats need to &#34;keep cutting through the Republican fog.&#34; 
Republican National Committee spokeswoman Emma Vaughn slammed Biden’s accusations, saying in a statement that &#34;Americans are rejecting the failed policies of the Biden administration and turning towards Republicans’ proven message.

A new national poll indicates that most Americans approve of the overall job 
President Biden
 is doing in the White House.
But, according to 
AP-NORC survey
 released Monday, the president&#39;s numbers are mixed on gun violence and underwater on 
immigration
.
WHAT&#39;S BIDEN&#39;S APPROVAL RATING IN THE MOST RECENT FOX NEWS POLLING?
Biden stands at 63% approval and 36% disapproval in the poll, which was conducted April 29-May 3. That compares to 54%-42% approval/disapproval in an average of all the most recent surveys that was compiled by Real Clear Politics.
As expected, the AP-NORC survey spotlighted a vast partisan divide, with 96% of Democrats and 62% of independents giving the president a thumbs up, but only 23% of Republicans approving of the job Biden is doing steering the country.
According to the poll, Biden has a 71%-27% approval on dealing with the 
coronavirus pandemic
. And he stands at 62%-35% on health care, 57%-42% on the economy, and 54%-41% on foreign policy. But the president’s approval drops to 48%-49% on gun policy, and 43%-54% on immigration, following a surge of migrants at the nation’s southern border earlier this year.

The poll also indicates that 54% say things in this country are going in the right direction, the highest level in AP polling since 2017.
The AP-NORC survey questioned 1,842 adults in America, with an overall sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.

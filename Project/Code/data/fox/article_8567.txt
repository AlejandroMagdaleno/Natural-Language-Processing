Former senior advisor to Trump says &#39;Americans are less safe&#39; as a result of administration&#39;s weak policy on &#39;Hannity&#39;
Former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller warned Friday that 
President Biden&#39;s
 verbal slips and gaffes are becoming a &#34;national security crisis.&#34;
&#34;Our adversaries around the world -- Iran, Russia and Venezuela and China -- they are looking at the United States and its chief representative, the president of our country, who is unable to get through even a softball interview without a cheat sheet and falls three times going up a flight of stairs. It&#39;s sad to watch,&#34; Miller said during an appearance on Fox News&#39; 
&#34;Hannity.&#34;
Miller&#39;s remarks came after host Sean Hannity played clips showing Biden requiring a &#34;cheat sheet&#34; when responding to questions and referring to his vice president as &#34;
President Harris
.&#34;
Earlier Friday, Biden stumbled multiple times as he ascended the steps to board Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.
&#34;I take no pleasure in it,&#34; Miller said. &#34;This is extremely serious. I have walked up and down those stairs many times. They are not slippery, and the Air Force makes sure they are not slippery.&#34;
BIDEN STUMBLES MULTIPLE TIMES, FALLS AS HE ASCENDS AIR FORCE ONE STAIRS
Hannity noted that the media has been largely silent on Biden&#39;s tripping incident, contrasting that with wall-to-wall coverage of then-President 
Donald Trump
 gingerly walking down a ramp following an event in West Point, New York.
He played clips of Associated Press reporter Jonathan Lemire and MSNBC&#39;s Joe Scarborough criticizing Trump and theorizing about his fitness for office.
At the time, 
Lemire said
 Trump&#39;s physical state should have made it difficult for him to criticize Biden during the 2020 presidential campaign.
&#34;I am pointing out what is obvious, because he is the President of the United States, the leader of the free world, the commander-in-chief. This is the hardest job in the world -- the most demanding job in the world,&#34; Hannity said.
US OFFICIAL ACCUSES CHINA OF &#39;GRANDSTANDING&#39; IN TENSE BILATERAL TALKS
Later in the segment, Miller said that Russian President 
Vladimir Putin
 distinctly recognizes Biden&#39;s apparent state of acuity, which is why the ex-KGB agent recently challenged the American president to a live debate after being called &#34;a killer.&#34;
&#34;They are openly mocking us. They are mocking President Biden. It&#39;s humiliating and that is compounded by the fact when you have a commander-in-chief who is &#39;not home&#39; and not there,&#34; he said.
&#34;They are openly mocking us. They are mocking President Biden. It&#39;s humiliating.&#34;
&#34;You&#39;ll have embarrassing episodes like what happened in Alaska where 
China dared to lecture us on human rights
. And [Secretary of state Antony] Blinken and [National Security Adviser Jake] Sullivan just sit there and take it?&#34; he fumed.

Miller concluded that the U.S. diplomats were &#34;apologizing for America&#34; in part because they have &#34;no leadership at the top.&#34;
&#34;The president is not home. Other countries see that weakness and they are pouncing and we are all less safe.&#34;

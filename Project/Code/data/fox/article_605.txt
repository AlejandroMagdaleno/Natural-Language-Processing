President Biden&#39;s administration
 has begun the process of restoring family planning grants to 
abortion
 providers like Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), which forfeited millions of dollars in response to Trump-era restrictions on family planning grants.
While the rule hasn&#39;t been finalized, it represents a first step toward undoing a significant portion of the former administration&#39;s anti-abortion agenda. A Wednesday proposal from the Biden administration accused former Trump of abandoning a &#34;client-centered approach&#34; and instead took one that &#34;cannot be squared with well-accepted public health principles.&#34;
The Trump policy will remain in effect until it is formally superseded by the Biden rule, a process that can take months. Biden administration officials believe that exercising restraint now will increase the odds of the changes ultimately being upheld in court.
The so-called &#34;gag rule&#34; blocks Title X grants from flowing to organizations where abortion is a method of family planning.

Planned Parenthood Federation of America challenged the policy in the courts and has decried it as &#34;cruel and vicious&#34; and on Wednesday applauded the Biden administration for beginning to reverse it.

&#34;The proposed regulations released today, when finalized, will end the Title X gag rule and make other modifications to strengthen the program and better ensure access to equitable, affordable, client-centered, quality health care services for patients under Title X,&#34; said CEO and president Alexis McGill-Johnson.
&#34;In the coming days, a 30-day comment period will allow the public to underline the harm the gag rule has wrought and emphasize why it must be ended as swiftly as possible,&#34; McGill-Johnson said.
She also framed the issue in terms of race and income. &#34;Due to centuries of systemic racism and injustice, the rule has disproportionately harmed people of color and people with low incomes, all at a time when access to affordable preventive health care has never been more critical.&#34;
HHS ANNOUNCES WHERE MILLIONS IN TITLE X MONEY GOING AFTER PLANNED PARENTHOOD ABANDONS GRANTS OVER ABORTION
Anti-abortion advocates have decried the amount of money flowing to the nation&#39;s largest abortion chain, 
particularly
 with it seeing increases in government funding over the years. PPFA, they&#39;ve argued, showed their priorities by deciding to sever Title X funds rather than their abortion practices.
PPFA and Planned Parenthood Global combined received $618.1 million in government funding in FY2020. According to Live Action&#39;s tracking, which dates back to the year 2000, that could be the largest sum in PPFA&#39;s history. Their most recent figures represent a 205% increase from the $202.7 million recorded for 2000.
In the fall of 2019
, Trump&#39;s Health and Human Services Department announced that taxpayer-funded family planning clinics would be banned from promoting or performing abortions, or referring patients to other clinics for them. &#34;HHS will continue to seek qualified entities to minimize any interruption of Title X services caused by the grantees that chose not to serve their patients as promised when they accepted Title X funds,&#34; HHS Director of External Affairs Mia Heck said at the time.

In a press release, the department said the awarded grants prioritized &#34;unserved and underserved jurisdictions and low-income individuals.&#34;
&#34;In order to minimize the service gaps created by those grantees, HHS awarded supplemental grants to qualified organizations that comply with the law,&#34; Heck said.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Saturday that she believes the 
Texas law
 banning most abortions in the state, which took effect last month, is &#34;extreme, inhumane and unconstitutional,&#34; according to the 
Associated Press
.

In addition, Collins voiced support for Roe v. Wade as the &#34;law of the land.&#34; Roe v. Wade is a landmark decision that legalized abortion across the country in 1973. It&#39;s not the first time Collins, a moderate, has voice support for what many conservatives have opposed for decades.
&#34;I support codifying Roe,&#34; Collins said in September, the Los Angeles Times reported. &#34;Unfortunately the bill … goes way beyond that. It would severely weaken the conscious exceptions that are in the current law.&#34; 
Collins was referring to a Democrat-backed bill in Congress to help ensure abortion access in all 50 states. Collins opposed that bill.

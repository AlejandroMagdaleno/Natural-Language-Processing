A bill introduced by a Democratic 
state lawmaker
 in 
Washington
 on Friday would prohibit the &#34;inappropriate&#34; use of Native American names, symbols or images for 
public school
 mascots, logos or team names.
There are currently 31 schools in the state that have Native American-linked mascots, Q13 FOX of Seattle reported.
The bill, led by state Rep. Debra Lekanoff, says although the use of indigenous mascots may be &#34;premised on the promotion of unity or school spirit, their use fails to respect the cultural heritage of Native Americans and promote productive relationships between sovereign governments.&#34;
The bill adds that the United States Commission on Civil Rights and other organizations have concluded that the use of Native American images in schools is a &#34;barrier to equality and understanding, and that all residents of the United States would benefit from the discontinuance of their use.&#34;

      North Central High School in Spokane is one of two high schools in the state that uses &#34;Indian&#34; as its mascot name, according to Q13. The other is Renton High School on the other side of the state.

Lekanoff, a Democrat who is Tlingit and Aleut, is the only indigenous woman in the state legislature, according to Q13.
The 
bill
, if passed, would go into effect in 2022 and would not include schools on tribal lands.
Lekanoff in a statement called indigenous-linked mascot usage &#34;degrading&#34; and said through it Native American people are treated &#34;no different than a token.&#34; 
&#34;This bill is a small change that will bring about healing and show respect for our Native American neighbors and friends,&#34; she added. &#34;It will give people some hope.&#34; 
Bellingham High Associated Student Body President, Logan Foy told 
Q13
 he thinks the use of indigenous mascots isn’t respectful.
&#34;It’s really dehumanizing of Indigenous people,&#34; he said, adding the school had a Native mascot until 2000 but changed it to a hawk.

Its sports teams&#39; nickname, the Red Raiders, will soon be changed as well, he said.
&#34;This time around we really want to make sure we get it right for not only the indigenous students at our school but also the community who&#39;s been affected by different attitudes and discriminations that our mascot has long represented and been a manifestation on,&#34; he added.
The Washington State Board of Education adopted resolutions in 1993 and 2012 encouraging school districts to re-examine policies and discontinue the use of Native American mascots, according to Lekanoff.
It&#39;s an effort that&#39;s already underway at some Washington schools. Last year Vancouver Public Schools&#39; Board of Directors voted to stop using the chieftain mascot at Columbia River High School and Minnehaha Elementary School.

The bill follows other high-profile controversies over indigenous names and mascots like the former Washington Redskins football team in Washington, D.C., which now calls itself the Washington Football Team.

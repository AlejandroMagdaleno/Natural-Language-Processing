President Biden responds to hecklers at an event in Georgia, confirming support for abolishing private prisons
President Biden
 on Thursday was interrupted as he began a rally in 
Georgia
 by protesters heckling him about private detention centers.
Shortly after Biden was introduced by First Lady Jill Biden, people in the crowd began shouting &#34;end detention now,&#34; interrupting the president’s remarks.
He attempted to continue, before saying &#34;I agree with you&#34; and explaining to other members of the crowd that the individuals shouting were referring to private detention centers
&#34;I’m working on it man, give me another five days,&#34; Biden eventually responded, which drew cheers and beeps from the crowd, who were in their vehicles at the drive-in rally. &#34;There should be no private prisons, period.&#34;
Biden added that his administration was working to close all private detention centers.
BIDEN ADDRESS TO CONGRESS DRAWS JUST 22.6 MILLION VIEWERS, LESS THAN HALF OF TRUMP&#39;S AUDIENCE IN 2017
In January, Biden signed an executive order that ended federal use of private prisons.
Democrats acknowledged the move as an important first step, but many progressives have pushed for more action.
Opponents of private, for-profit detention centers allege that the institutions are linked with racial injustice and perpetuate mass incarcerations.

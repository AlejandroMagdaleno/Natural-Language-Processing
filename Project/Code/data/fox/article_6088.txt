Sen. Mitch McConnell
, the Senate minority leader, said Tuesday that Democrats who are dead set on using reconciliation to pass a 
sweeping infrastructure package
 are in for a fight.
McConnell, who was in Kentucky at the time, said the &#34;era of bipartisanship on this stuff is over,&#34; according to 
the Hill. 
&#34;This is not going to be done on a bipartisan basis,&#34; he said. &#34;This is going to be a hell of a fight over what this country ought to look like in the future and it&#39;s going to unfold here in the next few weeks. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve had a bigger difference of opinion between the two parties.&#34;
The passage of a larger, multitrillion-dollar bill faces significant hurdles, even if Democrats use a procedural method that requires only a simple majority. It’s far from certain, in an evenly divided Senate, that moderate Democrats will agree to an expansive measure that could swell to as high as $6 trillion.
Members of the 
Problem Solvers Caucus 
on Tuesday announced their support of the $973 billion infrastructure deal proposed last month by a 
bipartisan group of senators. 
Fox News was told the caucus’ decision to approve passed with 75% of the vote, with each party passing 50% in support. The caucus endorsed the infrastructure bill as a stand-alone bill and not tied to any reconciliation package. 
The bipartisan $973 billion deal includes money to build a national network of electric vehicle charging stations, purchase thousands of electric buses and upgrade the electrical grid. It also would spend $55 billion to improve drinking water and wastewater systems and $47 billion in resiliency efforts to tackle climate change.

ABC News 
reported
 that  Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday, &#34;There&#39;s a lot of work that needs to happen with Congress, and we expect over the next week there to be a lot of behind the scenes bill writing negotiations discussions on Capitol Hill, long nights, lots of coffee over the course of the next several days. Given that [Senate Majority] Leader [Chuck] Schumer has conveyed that he would like to see both the reconciliation package and the infrastructure bill on the floor in July, and we&#39;re in July now in terms of the president&#39;s priorities.&#34;

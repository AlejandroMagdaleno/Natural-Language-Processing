FOX News correspondent Mark Meredith joins &#39;Fox Report&#39; with the details
Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 still hasn’t held a formal press briefing since taking office, even after 
President Biden
 tapped her to lead diplomatic efforts to solve the 
border crisis
.
Biden 
placed Harris in charge
 of addressing the root causes behind illegal immigration from Central America in a diplomatic role as pressure continues to mount and a historic number of migrants try to cross the border illegally.
After her tapping, Harris — who 
compared
 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to the Ku Klux Klan in 2018 — 
said
 that she would be working with &#34;civil societies&#34; and governments from Central American countries to address the reasons why people are illegally migrating to the U.S.
&#34;We can&#39;t just be in a reactive mode,&#34; she said. However, the vice president has not held a formal press briefing about how she plans to combat the growing crisis. 
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS IS &#39;NOT DOING THE BORDER,&#39; SENIOR ADVISER SAYS
Last week, a senior aide to Harris told reporters that the vice president &#34;is not doing the border&#34; and that she would not be tackling policy for the southern border, instead focusing on the root causes for illegal immigration from Central America.
&#34;The Vice President is not doing the border,&#34; the senior adviser said. &#34;The President asked the vice president to take on the diplomatic efforts with Mexico and… the Northern Triangle to address the root causes of migration.&#34;
Biden previously faced criticism after waiting until his 
64th day in office
 to hold a formal press briefing. 
Prior to Biden tapping her to handle the border crisis in a diplomatic role, Harris came under fire for laughing in response to a reporter’s question on whether she’d be traveling to the southern border.

Harris replied with a &#34;Not today!&#34; before laughing, sparking 
backlash
 from Republicans online.
Images shared by Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, 
showed 
the harrowing conditions of migrants — including children — being held in a migrant detention facility in Donna, Texas.

A 
Texas 
mayor 
submitted his resignation
 Thursday after his latest 
DUI arrest
 was upgraded to a felony because of two previous drunken driving arrests, according to reports.
Nin Hulett, mayor of Granbury, Texas, a small town outside Dallas, was arrested in the town shortly after midnight April 25, according to the Hood County News in Granbury.
&#34;I am truly thankful for the opportunity to serve my city these past ten years,&#34; Hulett, 68, said in a statement,&#34; FOX 4 in Dallas reported. &#34;Our City staff and City employees are truly among the best in the State, and I am proud to count out many involved citizens as friends and neighbors. Granbury has a special place in my heart, and I look forward to watching our city grow and prosper.&#34;
Hulett was previously arrested in Missouri in 1999 and by Fort Worth police in 2007, according to the

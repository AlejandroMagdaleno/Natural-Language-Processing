Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich reacts to video of border patrol agents encountering an abandoned migrant child on ‘Fox &amp;amp; Friends First.’
A &#34;heartbreaking&#34; video has emerged of a 10-year-old 
migrant child
 encountering 
Border Patrol agents
 after being abandoned at the 
U.S.-Mexico border.
Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich reacted to the video on 
&#34;Fox &amp; Friends First,&#34;
 and slammed the 
Biden
 administration’s handling of the border crisis as a &#34;national security issue&#34; and &#34;humanitarian crisis.&#34;
&#34;It is absolutely heartbreaking to see that video,&#34; Brnovich said. &#34;This is the United States of America, not some third-world country.&#34;
Brnovich urged Arizona Governor 
Doug Ducey
 to declare a state of emergency in order to protect residents of the state and 
migrants
 crossing the border under potentially dangerous circumstances. 
BORDER PATROL RESCUES 2 ABANDONED CHILDREN AT US-MEXICO BORDER, LATEST IN SPATE OF INCIDENTS
Brnovich, who has already been involved in 
three lawsuits
 with the Biden administration over their handling of the border, said that current leadership has &#34;decriminalized, incentivized&#34; and monetized illegal border crossings into the United States. 
&#34;You don’t have to be a psychic to have predicted this,&#34; Brnovich said. 
Chief Border Patrol Agent Brian Hastings posted footage of the 10-year-old child found under a farm tractor late in the night. 
The child can be seen approaching a Border Patrol agent vehicle, claiming that he was lost.
&#34;Where is your mother?&#34; one border patrol agent can be heard asking.
&#34;In the United States,&#34; the child replied.
When asked where other members of his group were, the child reiterated that he got lost.
&#34;Everything is okay, everything is okay son,&#34; the agent can be heard saying. 
BORDER CRISIS: 565 UNACCOMPANIED MIGRANT CHILDREN CROSSING DAILY INTO THE US
The child was found near the same area a child was rescued from just two weeks prior.
A video released just last week showed a smuggler dropping a 2-year-old migrant child to their father from the top of an 18-foot-high border wall structure, one of the latest crisis-era videos of children being dropped or abandoned at the border.
This month, Border Patrol agents rescued a 5-year-old and 6-year-old found alone and crying after they were abandoned by a couple who hoisted them over boulders near the end of the border wall. 
The children had their mother’s name and phone number on a note and on their forearms -- which agents used to get additional information.

statistics
 released indicating that there were more than 172,000 migrant encounters in March alone, including a record number of unaccompanied children. 
While many single adults have been sent back under Title 42 public health protections, many migrant families are being released into the interior, while unaccompanied children are not being expelled.

Former 
President Trump
 blasted the 
Biden administration&#39;s
 withdrawal 
from Afghanistan
 and speculated that China and Russia could already be reverse-engineering U.S. military equipment left behind.
Speaking with host Sharyl Attkisson during an interview that aired Sunday on &#34;Full Measure,&#34; Trump excoriated the withdrawal as &#34;incompetent&#34; and warned it will likely endanger the United States and benefit its enemies.
Trump also expressed doubt regarding whether the war in Afghanistan is over, noting how many unvetted Afghan refugees are being resettled in the United States and around the world.

&#34;I don&#39;t know because you have people going all over the world and being dropped all over the world right now, and nobody knows who the hell they are, Sharyl,&#34; Trump said. &#34;These aren&#39;t the interpreters that we took. These were people that rushed into the planes, and they were so interested in trying to make it sound like &#39;Oh, they&#39;re doing a good job.&#39; These people, many of these people are going to be terrorists.

Trump went on to 
suggest

&#34;Now I&#39;m saying, ‘How can they take this equipment?’ And I guarantee that China and Russia already have our Apache helicopters and they&#39;re taking them apart to find out exactly how they&#39;re made. They&#39;re the best in the world by far. And they&#39;re taking them apart so they can make the exact same equipment. They&#39;re very good at that. It&#39;s a disgrace.&#34;

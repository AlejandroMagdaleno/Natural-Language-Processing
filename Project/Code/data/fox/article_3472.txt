Ted Williams, a former Washington D.C. police detective, says new police-involved shooting &#39;is the last thing Minnesota needs&#39; amid murder trial of former officer Derek Chauvin.
The death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, 
Minnesota
 on Sunday has given new energy to the far-left &#34;defund the police&#34; movement. 
Multiple progressive activists, politicians and groups have renewed their demands to cut police funding after Wright was 
shot
 during a traffic stop.
Our Revolution — a spinoff of Bernie Sanders&#39; 2016 presidential campaign — called the death of Wright a &#34;murder&#34; and joined other progressive groups in calling for defunding the police.
&#34;Enough is enough! The murder of Daunte Wright was NO ACCIDENT - it is a systemic issue that must be addressed immediately. #DefundThePolice #CriminalJusticeReform,&#34; wrote the group.
MINNESOTA OFFICER MEANT TO FIRE TASTER, NOT HANDGUN, IN DEADLY DUANTE WRIGHT SHOOTING, POLICE CHIEF SAYS
Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., called for &#34;police funding to unarmed traffic forces to remove even the possibility of state-sanctioned manslaughter.&#34; Bowman has previously 
endorsed
 defunding the police. 
Los Angeles City Council candidate Michael Guzik posted his support for defunding police departments on Twitter where he retweeted a post from progressive group Ground Game LA.
The post that Guzik retweeted called for the abolition of the police and referred to the Blue Lives Matter flag — a flag signaling support of police — as &#34;a facist symbol that celebrates the lynching of Black people.&#34;
The progressive gun control group March for Our Lives claimed that America’s police system was &#34;built on white supremacy&#34; and that the police needed to be defunded to &#34;end gun violence.&#34;
&#34;No amount of training and reform can fix a system built on white supremacy,&#34; wrote the group. &#34;To end gun violence, we must #DefundThePolice and invest in our communities, the alternative is dire.&#34;
Progressive legal group Law for Black Lives also 
called
 for the police to lose funding, calling for the &#34;systems&#34; to be &#34;abolished.&#34;

Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon 
said on Monday
 that he believes the unidentified officer who shot and killed Wright was reaching for her Taser but pulled her firearm instead. Gannon classified the shooting as an &#34;accidental discharge.&#34;
The shooting led to 
looting and rioting
 in the Minneapolis area late Sunday night. About 500 people had gathered overnight outside of a police precinct in the city and clashed with officers.

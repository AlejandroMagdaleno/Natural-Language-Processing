&#34;The President has launched a comprehensive effort to take on the uptick in gun crime that has been taking place the last 18 months – putting more cops on the beat, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking,&#34; the statement said.
&#34;Confirming U.S. Attorneys as the chief federal law enforcement officers in their district is important for these efforts.&#34;
Williams would replace Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss, who ascended to the office’s top spot after former

Williams is an assistant attorney in the district and once worked as a law clerk for Merrick Garland on the U.S. Court of Appeals, according to the White House.

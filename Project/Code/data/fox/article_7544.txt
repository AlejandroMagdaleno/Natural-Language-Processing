Senator from Kentucky tells &#39;The Story&#39; former Florida lawmaker &#39;forgot he was a conservative
Sen. 
Rand Paul
, R-Ky., responded Wednesday to an on-air tirade by former Florida Republican congressman-turned-MSNBC host 
Joe Scarborough
, who claimed Paul and other GOP senators want America to &#34;forget&#34; the Jan. 6 Capitol riot as they rebuff Democrats&#39; push to convict President Trump.
Paul told &#34;
The Story
&#34; that Scarborough sounded &#34;deranged&#34; as he accused Paul, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Marco Rubio of Florida and Josh Hawley of Missouri by name of being more concerned about &#34;Senate procedure&#34; than whether or not Trump incited political violence.
&#34;This is what Rand Paul wants you to forget,&#34; Scarborough said while playing clips of the riot that led to the deaths of five people. &#34;This is what Ted Cruz wants you to forget ... And I say never, never forget. Just like I said after 9/11.&#34;
&#34;Call them by their name,&#34; Scarborough added. &#34;You&#39;re out of your mind and you&#39;re not a conservative.&#34;
Paul told &#34;The Story&#34; host Trace Gallager that if &#34;anybody has &#39;forgotten&#39; they&#39;re a conservative, it&#39;s Joe Scarborough.&#34;
&#34;I stood up and opposed [Trump&#39;s] position on the Electoral College. I did vote to seat the electors. I thought the argument was wrong. I made that argument,&#34; Paul continued. &#34;Joe Scarborough is so unhinged now and so much a hater of all Republicans and things conservative that he doesn&#39;t listen to the issues.&#34;
Scarborough, a staunch critic of the Trump-era GOP,  memorably tweeted in 2019 that 
he wanted Jesus Christ to forgive him
 for being a Republican
Paul added that the &#34;Morning Joe&#34; host &#34;has surrounded himself with sycophants&#34; and is no longer as fair-minded as he used to be.

The Republican noted that Scarborough made no mention of the fact that now-Vice President Kamala Harris donated to a bail fund for Black Lives Matter rioters or a Bernie Sanders supporter carried out an assassination attempt targeting congressional Republicans in June 2017.
&#34;Not one time have we said ... that you should impeach Kamala Harris or impeach Bernie Sanders because we&#39;re much more fair-minded people,&#34; Paul said. &#34;I&#39;ll let the public decide who is right on that.&#34;

Dr. Marc Siegel reacts to Press Secretary Jen Psaki stating that Joe Biden hopes to have schools open at least once a week in his first 100 days.
White House press secretary 
Jen Psaki
 said parents shouldn’t be satisfied with 
schools reopening
 one day a week as the 
White House
 works toward its goal of at least partially reopening schools by President Biden&#39;s 100th day in office. 
 
 
Psaki said parents &#34;shouldn’t be&#34; satisfied with sending their kids to school one day per week in response to a question from a reporter.
&#34;I wouldn’t be as a parent, and I am a parent, I should say. I have two young kids,&#34; she said.
The Biden administration has said they want to see 50% percent of schools open at least one day per week. But 
according to Burbio’s school reopening tracker
, the White House goal was reached months ago – about 64% of schools already offer some sort of in-person learning.

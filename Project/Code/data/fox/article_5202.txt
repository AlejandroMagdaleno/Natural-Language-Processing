Former Director of 
National Intelligence
 John Ratcliffe has blasted the 
Biden
 administration for its &#34;empty rhetoric&#34; in a new report about 
China
 that fails to mention any question of the origins of 
COVID-19
. 
President Biden has faced criticism over his handling of affairs with China, with some accusing him of being afraid to be too tough on a country that is arguably America’s biggest economic threat — if not the greatest security threat to the country as well.  
&#34;Case in point … Joe Biden put out a 200-page strategic plan on COVID-19 … and there is not a single word about the origins of COVID-19,&#34; Ratcliffe told Maria Bartiromo on &#34;

SEN. RAND PAUL: ‘IN ALL LIKELIHOOD’ COVID ESCAPED FROM A WUHAN LAB
However, Biden has yet to take a firm stance with China, a nation that many demand answers from over COVID-19&#39;s origins. 
The dominant theory in the early days of the pandemic was that the virus transmitted from a bat to a human in a Chinese wet market in Wuhan, but some pointed to a lab in Wuhan that may have been involved in virology and experimenting with viruses. 
The theory was initially dismissed, but it gained traction last month after The Wall Street Journal published a story about a U.S. intelligence report that revealed three researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology had sought hospital treatment for an unidentified illness in November 2019, when researchers say the virus was spreading through the city of 11 million people.

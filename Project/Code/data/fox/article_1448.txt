President Biden
 on Tuesday backed embattled 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo&#39;s
 decision to resign amid a scathing investigation into sexual harassment allegations while saying the 
New York
 governor did &#34;a hell of a job.&#34;
&#34;I respect the governor&#39;s decision and I respect the decision he made,&#34; Biden said at the White House shortly after Cuomo announced he would step down from the job in two weeks.
NY GOV. CUOMO RESIGNS AMID SEXUAL HARASSMENT SCANDAL
When asked how Cuomo&#39;s actions would affect the Democratic Party, Biden signaled he thought the fallout would be limited.
&#34;I think the impact is all on Andrew Cuomo and his decision to make that judgment,&#34; Biden said. &#34;And I respect his decision.&#34;
Cuomo, a major Biden ally, announced his resignation earlier Tuesday after an independent investigation found credible allegations of sexual harassment against Cuomo from female employees.
COULD ANDREW CUOMO PARDON HIMSELF BEFORE LEAVING OFFICE?
Biden lamented the loss of the governor&#39;s leadership and touted Cuomo&#39;s record on policies, outside of his personal conduct. 
&#34;He&#39;s done a hell of a job,&#34; Biden said. &#34;… That&#39;s why it&#39;s so sad.&#34;
Press secretary Jen Psaki later tweeted about Biden&#39;s response.

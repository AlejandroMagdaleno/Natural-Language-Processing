Mayor 
Bill de Blasio
 said Thursday he is &#34;miffed&#34; that 
New York City
 public schools changed Columbus Day to &#34;Italian Heritage Day/Indigenous People&#39;s Day&#34; without his approval. 
&#34;I&#39;m as miffed as you are,&#34; de Blasio told a reporter during his Thursday briefing. 
On Tuesday, the city’s Department of Education (DOE) quietly released its school calendar, and Oct. 11 was marked a day off school not for Christopher Columbus, but for indigenous peoples. The calendar drew backlash from the city’s Italian American leaders who take pride in Columbus; it was taken offline Tuesday evening. 
When it was reposted, the holiday had been changed to &#34;Italian Heritage Day/Indigenous People&#39;s Day.&#34; Students and staff were also given a day off on June 20 to celebrate Juneteenth, which is on June 19 but falls on a Sunday this year.
&#34;I think this process wasn&#39;t handled right. I certainly didn&#39;t hear about the change, nor did the chancellor. So we spoke about it and we both agreed this was not the right way to handle things,&#34; the Democratic mayor said in a briefing a day earlier.

&#34;The fact that a calendar naming didn&#39;t come to her attention or my attention on one hand doesn&#39;t surprise me, but it was not the right thing to do,&#34; he continued. 
Still, the mayor said he is happy to see a day honoring Italian Americans. 
&#34;I&#39;m an Italian American could not be more proud ... We have to honor that day as a day to recognize the contributions of all Italian Americans. So, of course, the day should not have been changed arbitrarily. I think saying it&#39;s a day to celebrate Italian American heritage is absolutely right and appropriate,&#34; he said. 
&#34;The process wasn&#39;t right, but the end result is going to be a day to honor Italian American heritage, a day to honor indigenous peoples.&#34;
Gov. Andrew Cuomo also blasted the renaming decision on Wednesday. 
NYC SCHOOLS REPLACE COLUMBUS DAY WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLES&#39; DAY
&#34;Let me give you a shocker. You ready for a shocker? I disagree with it. I know you’re taken aback. Cities have certain authority and a city can declare a city holiday. When it comes to appreciating and respecting Indigenous people, I agree 100%. They deserve much more than a holiday,&#34; Cuomo said.
&#34;Columbus Day is a day where we celebrate the Italian American contribution to this state. It’s not either/or. We’re not drawing lines and dividing. You don’t have to exclude Italians to celebrate indigenous people.&#34;
A push for federal recognition of Juneteenth gained steam last year after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed 
George Floyd
. Last summer, Republican Sens. Ron Johnson and James Lankford 
introduced
 an amendment proposing to replace Columbus Day with Juneteenth as a new federal holiday to avoid putting the U.S. &#34;further in  debt.&#34;

&#34;In response to a bipartisan effort to give federal workers another day of paid leave by designating Juneteenth a federal holiday, we have offered a counterproposal that does not put us further in debt,&#34; Johnson said Wednesday. &#34;We support celebrating emancipation with a federal holiday, but believe we should eliminate a current holiday in exchange. We chose Columbus Day as a holiday that is lightly celebrated, and least disruptive to Americans’ schedules.&#34;

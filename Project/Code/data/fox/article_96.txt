Just weeks after voting in support of the 
second impeachment
 of former 
President Donald Trump
, U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., is already facing a pro-Trump GOP primary challenger.
His opponent? 
Catalina Lauf
, a 27-year-old who previously served in the Trump administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce. She launched her bid Tuesday to oust the 42-year-old incumbent in Illinois&#39; 16th Congressional District. 
&#34;I never thought I&#39;d primary a fellow Republican, but is Congressman Kinzinger really a Republican anymore? He isn&#39;t and we have the proof,&#34; Lauf says in a video campaign announcement.
GOP CANDIDATE CATALINA LAUF SAYS MAINSTREAM MEDIA &#39;CAN&#39;T FATHOM&#39; A &#39;YOUNG LATINA&#39; TRUMP SUPPORTER
Lauf attacks Kinzinger as a &#34;weak-kneed, establishment Republican&#34; who &#34;cares more about his next MSNBC appearance than the voters who elected him.&#34; 
She suggests that the sitting congressman does not support the &#34;America First&#34; movement, pointing to his &#34;one in three votes&#34; in Congress that have sided with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
&#34;Instead of being in our fight, Adam betrayed his constituents for a life in the D.C. swamp,&#34; Lauf says. 
She then slams the &#34;Fake Republican&#34; for supporting the &#34;phony impeachment hoax for a president who has already left office.&#34;
&#34;He said impeachment was &#39;necessary to save America.&#39; What?&#34; Lauf reacts. &#34;You know what I think is necessary to save America, Adam? Setting term limits for people like you and the rest of your friends out. Six terms in Congress is enough.&#34;
Lauf goes on to accuse Kinzinger of &#34;further fan[ning] flames&#34; by &#34;divid[ing] our party.&#34;
Among the candidate&#39;s listed priorities she sets to tackle on Capitol Hill include &#34;social media censorship,&#34; &#34;election integrity,&#34; &#34;freedom of speech,&#34; &#34;gun rights,&#34; &#34;illegal immigration,&#34; and &#34;keeping the economy going.&#34;
Lauf previously ran for Congress in Illinois&#39; 14th Congressional District in 2020 but was defeated in a crowded GOP primary by state Sen. Jim Oberweis, who fell short in the general election against Democratic incumbent Rep. Lauren Underwood by less than 2 percent.

Lauf prides herself as the daughter of a Guatemalan immigrant mother, who came to the U.S. legally, and a small business owner father. She also branded herself as the &#34;anti-AOC.&#34; 
Both she and her sister Madeline were prominently featured in a video during last year&#39;s Republican National Convention in support of President Trump.

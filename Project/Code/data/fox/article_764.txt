White House Correspondent Peter Doocy discusses the impact of Biden’s vaccine mandate on small businesses on ‘Special Report’
A new poll claims President 
Joe Biden
&#39;s job approval is &#34;underwater&#34; as a majority of Americans negatively score his withdrawal from 
Afghanistan
 and criticize his handling of climate change.
Quinnipiac University&#39;s
 announcement of the poll stated that Biden is &#34;underwater on job approval and handling of key issues.&#34; In the poll, which was released Tuesday and features responses from 1,210 U.S. adults nationwide, 50% of Americans disapprove of Biden&#39;s job performance as president while 42% approve. Compared to last month&#39;s approval rating, Biden fell four percentage points. In late August, 46% of Americans approved and 43 percent disapproved, according to Quinnipiac.
Among party lines, Democrats approve 88 to 7 percent, while Republicans disapprove 91 - 7 percent and independents disapprove 52 - 34 percent.

Biden also received a negative score for his handling of foreign policy, with 59 percent stating they did not approve. Fifty-five percent of Americans who were surveyed in the poll also disapproved of Biden&#39;s handling of his job as Commander in Chief of the U.S. military, while 40 percent approved.
Regarding the economy, the survey found that Biden received a negative rating of 42% to 52%, a four percent increase in disapproval since a Quinnipiac survey in August.
The poll found Americans were slightly split on Biden&#39;s handling of climate change, with 45% disapproving and 42% approving, marking a 10 percent increase in disapproval since August.
&#34;If there ever was a honeymoon for President Biden, it is clearly over. This is, with few exceptions, a poll full of troubling negatives... from overall job approval, to foreign policy, to the economy,&#34; said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy.

While respondents approved of Biden&#39;s decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan 54% to 41%, he received criticism for the way he handled the withdrawal as 65% said they disapprove and only 31 percent said they approve. Sixty-two percent of respondents also said they believe American troops will have to return to Afghanistan to fight terrorism.
&#34;&#39;The pullout is over, but boots will be back on the ground eventually,&#39; predict voters, who clearly see a looming terrorist threat churning in the cauldron that is Afghanistan,&#34; said Malloy.
Seventy percent of those who took part in the survey said they are very dissatisfied (46%) or somewhat dissatisfied (24%) with the way things are going in America currently. Less than 30% are very satisfied (3%) or somewhat satisfied (26%).

Progressive &#34;
Squad
&#34; Democrats in the 
House of Representatives
 in recent days condemned 
anti-Semitic
 attacks in the United States as they also assailed Israel as an alleged &#34;Apartheid&#34; state that is killing children – comments some have said are creating an excuse for pro-Palestinian radicals to violently attack Jews. 
The &#34;Squad&#34; members – consisting of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.; Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Cori Bush, D-Mo.; and Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y. – all issued statements over the weekend or late last week amid a rush of anti-Semitic attacks in American cities. 
&#34;Horrific and unacceptable,&#34; Omar 
said
 of an attack at a Los Angeles sushi restaurant. &#34;Nobody should face threats and harassment based on their religion or ethnicity.&#34;
&#34;There is no room for antisemitism, hate, or prejudice in New York&#39;s 16th Congressional District,&#34; Bowman said in a lengthy statement. &#34;So I ask you today – wherever you encounter antisemitism, speak up… As a community, we will send a clear message: Hate never has a place her, and it never will.&#34;

BERNIE SANDERS CALLS HAMAS A ‘TERRORIST GROUP’ BUT SAYS ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAS ‘OVERT RACISTS’
But other members of the small informal caucus issued statements that were more equivocal, mentioning ant-Semitism alongside Islamophobia or couching statements against anti-Semitism with critiques against Israel. 
&#34;I strongly condemn the rise in anti-Semitism and islamophobia we’re seeing across the country,&#34; Pressley said. &#34;Let me say it again: our freedom and our destinies are tied. The struggle for liberation and justice requires all of us to reject hate and division in any form.&#34; Her statement was shared by Tlaib. 
&#34;The work of dismantling antisemitism, anti-Blackness, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism, and every other form of hate is OUR work,&#34; Bush added. &#34;There is no room for hate of any kind in our movements for justice.&#34;
&#34;There is no room for anti-semitism in the movement for Palestinian liberation,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Friday. &#34;Our critique is of Israel and their human rights abuses. This is not an excuse for anti-semitic hate crimes.&#34;
The comment from Ocasio-Cortez drew criticism from Seffi Kogan, the global director of young leadership at The American Jewish Committee. Kogan noted that the tweet condemning anti-Semitism came from her official congressional Twitter account rather than her campaign account, which has a much largervfollowing. 
Kogan also wrote in 
Newsweek
 that comments from Ocasio-Cortez and other &#34;Squad&#34; members saying Israel is an &#34;Apartheid&#34; state give a justification to radicals who might be inclined to attack Jews, even if the members of Congress are clear in their condemnations of bigotry and violence. 
&#34;While anti-Zionist gangs beat up Jews in her city, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was providing a quasi-intellectual basis for their actions, defaming Israel as an apartheid state employing indiscriminate force in what she seems to think is a capricious quest to murder as many Palestinian children as possible, instead of a highly restrained military operation tightly targeted on terrorists,&#34; Kogan wrote.

He added: &#34;Rep. Ocasio-Cortez didn&#39;t call for violence, but she carved out an area of respectability for a certain type of anti-Semitism, and others were only too happy to rush in, fists flying.&#34;
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., an intellectual ally of the &#34;Squad,&#34; on Sunday echoed comments made by the liberal House members CBS&#39; &#34;Face the Nation.&#34; Sanders condemned Hamas as a &#34;terrorist group&#34; but also assailed the Israeli government as &#34;right-wing&#34; and containing &#34;overt racists.&#34; 
&#34;You have a right-wing Israeli government and the situation is getting worse,&#34; Sanders said. &#34;And all that I&#39;m saying is that the United States of America has got to be leading the world in bringing people together, not simply supplying weapons to kill children in Gaza.&#34;
Sanders himself is Jewish. But similar comments were made by Rep. 
Mark Pocan
, D-Wis., and Omar, which Kogan called &#34;the contemporary blood libel that Israel indiscriminately murders children.&#34; 
&#34;The United States should be doing everything in our power to bring about an immediate end to this conflict and the carnage it has caused,&#34; Omar said in a 
statement
 disapproving of U.S. weapons sales to Israel, &#34;not continuing to sell Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the very bombs used to kill Palestinian children.&#34;

Democrats in recent years have struggled with how to handle Israel and the Middle East with a growing divide between old-guard, pro-Israel Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and younger members like those in the &#34;Squad.&#34; 
Omar in 2019 made 
comments
 condemned by many senior Democrats as anti-Semitic, writing on Twitter that &#34;Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.&#34; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., at the time said Omar&#39;s &#34;use of anti-Semitic tropes… is deeply offensive.&#34;

The House 
later
 passed a broad resolution condemning anti-Semitism and racism. 
The latest round of fighting between Hamas and Israel has brought those tensions to the surface again, with Schumer keeping a low profile on the issue and only referring to a boilerplate statement when asked about it. Schumer has, however, explicitly condemned anti-Semitism without qualifying his statements. 
&#34;We must stand together to stop the recent surge in anti-Semitic attacks,&#34; he tweeted Sunday night. &#34;We must stand together against the forces of hate. Anti-Semitism, bigotry, and intolerance have no place in New York or anywhere else.&#34;

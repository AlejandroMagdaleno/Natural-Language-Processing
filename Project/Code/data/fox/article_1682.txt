Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., argues too much unnecessary spending is being tacked onto infrastructure legislation and discusses her efforts to de-fund critical race theory. 
Former 
New Jersey
 Governor Chris Christie called out 
President Biden
 on Monday for allowing 
Canada
 to receive 
COVID-19
 vaccines from the U.S. while at the same time barring fully vaccinated Americans from crossing the northern border.
Christie blasted the president in a tweet posted Monday, saying more losing the upper hand coming from the Biden administration’s foreign policy and vaccine messaging with Canada.
&#34;More weakness from Biden foreign policy and mixed messages on vaccines,&#34; Christie, a 
potential 2024 presidential candidate
, wrote on Twitter. &#34;Canada continues to ask for US help with vaccines but refuses to allow for fully vaccinated Americans to enter Canada.&#34;
US, CANADA, MEXICO NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS EXTENDED TO JUNE 21
&#34;This is just wrong,&#34; Christie continued. &#34;A double standard where America and Americans are being used.&#34;
Christie followed up the tweet with another calling on Biden to &#34;push back&#34; against Canada’s foreign policy and stand up for America.
&#34;President Biden must push back [and] insist that if Canada believes in science [and] wants our vaccines, then they need to accept the broader premise that vaccinated people crossing borders either way go hand in hand with the notion of expanded vaccination success,&#34; the New Jersey Republican wrote. &#34;Stand up for America!&#34;
The former governor’s criticism comes after the U.S., Canada and Mexico agreed to 
extend the coronavirus restrictions
 on nonessential travel across land borders last week.

&#34;To fight [COVID-19] spread and protect our citizens, the U.S. is continuing restrictions on non-essential travel at land borders through June 21, while allowing essential trade [and] travel,&#34; the Department of Homeland Security wrote on Twitter last week. &#34;We&#39;re working closely with Canada [and] Mexico to safely ease restrictions as conditions improve.&#34;
The 
White House
 did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment on Christie&#39;s criticisms.

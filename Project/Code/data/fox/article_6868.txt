Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren and Celtic Strategies co-founder Kevin Walling react to a study that shows Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as being one of the least effective lawmakers in the House.
A group linked to firebrand Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-
N.Y.
, is backing a far-left candidate who has called for defunding
 law enforcement
 in a congressional primary against a senior Democrat in Congress.
Justice Democrats
 — a political action committee 
linked
 to Ocasio-Cortez and other members of the progressive &#34;Squad&#34; — threw their support behind activist 
Rana Abdelhamid
 in a primary challenge to Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y.
&#34;I really love my community and love communities in New York,&#34; Abdelhamid said. &#34;It’s time for Congress to finally look like our communities and to have a representative who will fight for all of us ― not just certain groups or certain neighborhoods.&#34;
Maloney has represented New York in Congress since 1993.
Similar to the &#34;Squad&#34; members she hopes to join in Congress, Abdelhamid has called for the defunding of police and directed followers to 
donate
 to a Minnesota 
fund
 that posted bail for alleged rioters and violent criminals.

&#34;Don’t listen to the Media&#39;s narrative about Black resistance,&#34; a graphic she posted read. &#34;Instead fund MN activists.&#34;
She also called defunding law enforcement a feminist &#34;
priority
&#34; on Instagram in a series of self-made graphics.
&#34;Intimate Partner Violence is up to 4x higher in homes of cops than the general population,&#34; she wrote in a graphic, citing the National Center for Women and Policing. Another graphic in the post encouraged readers to donate to &#34;Defund the Police Efforts.&#34;
SQUAD MEMBER CALLS FOR END OF US POLICING, WHICH SHE SAYS IS ‘INTENTIONALLY RACIST’
In addition to 
supporting
 defunding law enforcement, Abdelhamid has also backed other far-left ideas, such as 
packing
 the Supreme Court and 
abolishing
 the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
New York State Democratic Party chairman Jay Jacobs defended Maloney in a 
statement
 on Wednesday.
&#34;Make no mistake about it. This challenge is not about progressive causes. This challenge is about one thing: power,&#34; Jacobs said in his statement. &#34;Maloney has it and the DSA wants it. Maloney can proudly stand on her record.&#34;

&#34;Abdelhamid may challenge Maloney, but I challenge Abdelhamid to be honest with the voters she is seeking the support of. I’ve read the DSA platform. Everyone should,&#34; he continued. &#34;Tell the voters where you and the DSA stand on &#34;defunding the police;&#34; ending capitalism in America, unilaterally disarming the nuclear deterrent of the U.S. military, and seizing private businesses that have to lay off workers even when their survival requires it.&#34;
&#34;Simply, the DSA wants America to replace the capitalist system with the historically proven failure of socialism,&#34; wrote Jacobs, who said the group &#34;picked the wrong opponent&#34; for their latest congressional battle.

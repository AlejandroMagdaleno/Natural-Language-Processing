&#39;Fox Nation&#39; host Tomi Lahren rips donut giant for offering free treats for vaccinated Americans.&amp;nbsp;
In her 
&#34;Final Thoughts&#34;
 commentary on Thursday, 
Fox Nation
 host 
Tomi Lahren
 ripped Krispy Kreme for announcing they will reward every customer who provides proof of a COVID 
vaccine
 a free glazed donut for every day of 2021.
Lahren said it is both ridiculous and a symptom of the state of American culture, as a confectionery company can be lauded as the latest champion of public health, while common-sense activities that scientifically provide a healthy lifestyle are shunned or even prohibited.
&#34;Nothing like using junk food to incentivize 
COVID
 health protocols,&#34; Lahren said, calling the Winston-Salem, N.C.-based company&#39;s program another example of the &#34;new and completely moronic normal.&#34;
&#34;Flashback to one year ago and the &#39;2 weeks to flatten the curve&#39; charade that I referred to as &#39;the big lie&#39; -- businesses were deemed non-essential while grocery and liquor stores remained wide open.&#34;
She noted that 
California
 closed its beaches, parks and trails as coronavirus pandemic precautions, despite the fact those three collective entities provided a proven way to remain healthy and active. An active lifestyle, she noted, incrementally helps fend off viruses of all sorts.
&#34;All that science was abandoned in the name of COVID fearmongering,&#34; she said.
FOX NATION DIGS INTO &#39;THE CURSE OF TIPPECANOE&#39; AS PART OF LOOK BACK AT REAGAN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
&#34;A year later we are still not back to actual normal we stil have mask mandates, many children are still in virtual learning and unable to play sports -- and despite the vaccine rollout there doesnt seem to be an end in sight to the madness.&#34;
&#34;But, rest easy, Americans -- you might not be able to work out at a full-capacity gym [nor] be able to breathe fresh air without a mask... but if you get your vaccine, Krispy Kreme will reward you with a free donut every day for the rest of the year.&#34;
She remarked that the company is &#34;making the country safe and healthy again by giving people free circular diabetes rings if they prove they&#39;ve gotten a COVID shot -- makes perfect sense right.&#34;
Lahren went on to point to the tribulations of New Jersey gym owners Frank Trumbetti and Ian Smith, whose Camden-area business &#34;Atilis Gym&#34; has been under fire both in the public square and the courtroom for defying the orders of the state&#39;s Democratic Gov. Philip Murphy, as well as local officials.

&#34;Gyms and other fitness establishments do far more for the good of public health than any vaccine ever could,&#34; said Lahren.
In response to Krispy Kreme&#39;s offer to vaccinated people, however, Smith announced Tuesday that Atilis will be offering free memberships to anyone who does 
not
 get the vaccine.
&#34;We believe in health - the real way - exercise, good diet, plenty of Vitamin D, Zinc, and an environment to de-stress,&#34; Smith said.

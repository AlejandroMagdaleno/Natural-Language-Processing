Sen. Rick Scott R-FL reacts to Senate officials ruling that wage hike cannot be included in stimulus package.
Sen. 
Rick Scott
 R-Fla. said Friday that the 
Biden
 administration and 
Democrats
 &#34;don&#39;t care about jobs&#34; and that the attempted inclusion of a $15 minimum wage in the latest coronavirus stimulus bill is just &#34;payback&#34; to liberal Democrats. 
Scott, during an interview on 
&#34;Fox &amp; Friends,&#34;

You know what you get paid when you don&#39;t have a job, zero. I grew up in a poor family. I watched my dad&#39;s car get repossessed twice. When you lose your job it’s zero pay...

When they are talking about raising the minimum wage, they’re saying we don&#39;t care about jobs just like the Keystone pipeline they killed 10,000 jobs there. The Biden administration and the Democrats do not care about your jobs. 
What I did when I was governor, we added 1.7 million jobs because we figured out how to grow businesses. They are doing the opposite. And then this package, it&#39;s just a payback to liberal Democrats.&#34;

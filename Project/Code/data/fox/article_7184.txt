GOP representative tells &#39;Special Report&#39; there is &#39;no doubt&#39; she won her congressional election
A 
Minnesota
 Democrat broke with his party on Monday by opposing the effort to overturn the election of Rep. Marianette Miller-Meeks, R-
Iowa
, saying doing so would be &#34;painful&#34; for the country.
Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., called on Democratic leadership to abandon their pursuit of overturning Miller-Meeks’ state-certified election to place her opponent Rita Hart in 
Congress
.
Phillips – who sits on the House Ethics Committee – said that while the electoral loss by six votes was &#34;painful&#34; for Democrats, overturning the election would be agonizing for America.
&#34;Losing a House election by six votes is painful for Democrats,&#34; Phillips wrote on Twitter. &#34;But overturning it in the House would be even more painful for America.&#34;
REPUBLICANS ACCUSE DEM ELECTION LAWYER OF ‘SERIOUS CONFLICT OF INTEREST’ IN CASE TO REVERSE IOWA HOUSE RACE
&#34;Just because a majority can, does not mean a majority should,&#34; added Phillips.
Politico 
confirmed 
that House Democratic leadership gave the green light to pursue pirating Miller-Meeks’ seat on Monday.
National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesman Mike Berg told Fox News that the NRCC is happy to see Phillips break with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her &#34;toxic attempt&#34; to take the Iowa seat.

&#34;We’re glad Rep. Phillips took our advice and came out against Nancy Pelosi’s toxic attempt to overturn a state-certified election,&#34; said Berg. &#34;Rep. Phillips’ vulnerable colleagues should follow his lead.&#34;
Democrats in Congress have been pushing to reverse Miller-Meeks’ victory to represent Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District.

Miller-Meeks 
spoke out
 against the Democratic effort to take her House seat in a &#34;Special Report&#34; interview earlier this month, defending her state-certified win and saying people across America should be &#34;outraged&#34; at the attempt to overturn it.
&#34;Everybody across the country should be outraged by this,&#34; said Miller-Meeks. &#34;I certainly have been encouraged by those people across the country who have reached out to me and told me they’re contacting their representatives to let them know their displeasure.&#34;

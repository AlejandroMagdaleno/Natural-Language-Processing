Twitter

The 
White House
 said Biden does not support debt relief above $10,000 for all borrowers.
&#34;The president does not favor $50,000 in student loan relief without limitation,&#34; a White House spokesperson told Fox News last week. 
Any debt relief above $10,000 would have to be targeted, &#34;based on the borrower’s income, based on the kind of debt in question,&#34; the White House said.

White House chief of staff 
Ron Klain told Politico
 Thursday that Cardona is preparing a report for the president on his legal authority to cancel student debt. 
&#34;He asked his secretary of 
education
, who’s just been on the job a few weeks, once he got on the job to have his department prepare a memo on the president’s legal authority, and hopefully we’ll see that in the next few weeks,&#34; Klain told Politico. &#34;And then he’ll look at that legal authority, he’ll look at the policy issues around that, and he’ll make a decision.&#34;

The president campaigned on canceling up to $10,000 in student debt per borrower, but Democrats pushed him to raise that number to $50,000 in a 
resolution
 in February. The NAACP is one of the most recognizable groups teaming up with progressives to push for student debt cancellation. 
However, the plan may disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans, according to 
analysis
 by the University of Chicago’s Becker Friedman Institute for Economics. The study showed that erasing all student loan debt would distribute $192 billion to the top 20% of earners in the U.S., but just $29 billion to the bottom 20% of U.S. households.
Under a universal loan forgiveness program, the average individual among the top-earning borrowers would receive $5,944 in forgiveness, while those with the lowest incomes would receive $1,070 in forgiveness, according to the study.

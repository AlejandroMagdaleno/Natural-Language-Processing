Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg gives an update on infrastructure negotiations and discusses Democrats&#39; plan for a larger spending bill
Transportation Secretary 
Pete Buttigieg
 on Saturday announced that he and his husband Chasten are the parents of twins -- thanking the public for their &#34;kind wishes&#34; since they first announced they were growing their family.
&#34;Chasten and I are beyond thankful for all the kind wishes since first sharing the news that we’re becoming parents,&#34; Buttigieg tweeted. 
BUTTIGIEG, HUSBAND CHASTEN MOCKED FOR COMPLAINING ABOUT HIGH RENT IN DC
&#34;We are delighted to welcome Penelope Rose and Joseph August Buttigieg to our family.&#34;
Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary before being nominated to the Cabinet-level role by President Biden, had announced in August that he and Chasten had become parents.
&#34;The process isn’t done yet and we’re thankful for the love, support, and respect for our privacy that has been offered to us,&#34; he said at that time. &#34;We can’t wait to share more soon.&#34;

Chasten Buttigieg had 
recently commented
 on the dramatic difference in rent prices in Washington D.C., saying their new Eastern Market digs are a far cry from the price of living in their old city of South Bend.
&#34;We’re doing fine for ourselves, and [yet] the city is almost unaffordable,&#34; Chasten told The Washington Post. &#34;Which tells you how extremely unaffordable it is for many people.&#34;

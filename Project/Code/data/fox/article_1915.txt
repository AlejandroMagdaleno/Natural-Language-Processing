Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., on Secretary Antony Blinken testifying on Afghanistan withdrawal.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken was pressed to comment on 
President Biden&#39;s
 last call with Afghan President Mohammad Ghani after reports alleged that the president pressured his Afghan counterpart to lie about the deteriorating security situation in Afghanistan over the summer.
&#34;I&#39;m obviously not going to comment on leaked, purportedly leaked, transcripts of phone calls,&#34; Blinken said in response to Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., who questioned Blinken on whether he agreed with Biden&#39;s handling of the phone call during the Monday hearing. &#34;What the president said in that conversation with then-President Ghani is exactly what he was saying to in public.&#34;
Blinken added that Biden said the &#34;issue is not the capacity&#34; of the &#34;Afghan government and the Afghan security forces,&#34; but whether they had the &#34;will, and whether they had a plan&#34; to hold important parts of the country.
BIDEN PRESSED AFGHAN PRESIDENT TO CHANGE &#39;PERCEPTION&#39; THAT TALIBAN WAS WINNING, &#39;WHETHER TRUE OR NOT&#39;
The secretary of state also said the administration was &#34;concerned&#34; they were not demonstrating the will or a plan and also stressed that Ghani needed to &#34;bring people together.&#34;
Pressed again by the New Jersey Republican to comment on whether the leaked transcript was true, Blinken still refused to answer.
&#34;Again, I&#39;m not commenting on any purportedly leaked transcripts,&#34; Blinken responded. &#34;I&#39;m telling you what, based on my knowledge of the conversation, the president said and what he said is exactly what he said in public.&#34;
At issue was the 
transcript of a call
 Biden had with Ghani in July that was leaked to Reuters, which reported that Biden pressured Ghani to change the &#34;perception of the Taliban’s progress in 
Afghanistan

&#34;I need not tell you the perception around the world and in parts of Afghanistan, I believe, is that things are not going well in terms of the fight against the Taliban,&#34; Biden said. &#34;And there is a need, whether it is true or not, there is a need to project a different picture.&#34;
Critics have 
seized on the call
, accusing Biden of lying to the American people about the situation in Afghanistan while knowing that it was quickly deteriorating.

House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 tapped progressive firebrand Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 for a new 
House
 committee she formed to address wealth inequality in America.

She highlighted her work on the Financial Services Committee and said she hopes the new committee will examine traditional assumptions about the economy.
&#34;One of the things that would be interesting for us to examine is that we should probably revisit some of the basic macroeconomic assumptions about the U.S. economy and not take for granted that inflation is due to one thing or another, or that full employment is impossible in the United States of America,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez said at a news event for the new committee, adding that she wants to ensure that &#34;every American has a dignified job.&#34;

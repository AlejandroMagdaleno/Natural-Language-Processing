Senate minority leader says Biden administration is making it easy for Republicans to unify
Senate Minority Leader 
Mitch McConnell
, R-Ky., said Thursday he would &#34;absolutely&#34; support 
Donald Trump
 if the former president won the 
Republican 
nomination in 2024.
However, McConnell told 
&#34;Special Report
&#34; host Bret Baier that &#34;there&#39;s a lot to happen between now and &#39;24. I&#39;ve got at least four members, I think, that are planning on running for president, plus governors and others. There is no incumbent, [so it] should be a wide-open race and fun for you all to cover.&#34;
McConnell was 
lambasted by the former president
 recently after the senator condemned Trump’s behavior during the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. When asked by Baier to respond to Trump’s allegation that the Republican Party could never be respected if leaders such as McConnell remained in charge, he replied, &#34;The Republican Party is actually in very good shape. 
&#34;We gained seats in the House. We elected 50 Republican senators when everybody was predicting we were going to lose the Senate. The Democrats didn’t flip a single state legislature. We flipped two [and] picked up a governor.
MCCONNELL: PELOSI COMMISSION TO PROBE JAN. 6 HAS &#39;PARTISAN SLANT&#39;
&#34;The Republican Party had a very good day on November 3,&#34; McConnell continued. &#34;We’re sorry we lost the White House, but the Republican Party demonstrated once again [that] this is a 50/50 nation, we are very competitive and will be competitive again in &#39;22.&#34;
McConnell also dismissed speculation that there is a civil war within the GOP, saying the real disunity lies with House Democrats.
&#34;The progressives make it extremely difficult for 
Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi
 to operate given the narrow margin she has overall in the House,&#34; he said.

Meanwhile, according to McConnell, &#34;I think the Biden administration is making it easy for us to get together. I think we’ve unified in opposition to this new administration’s extremely progressive approach. President Biden has made it quite easy for us to get together.&#34;
Baier finished the interview by asking what McConnell&#39;s message is to Trump supporters who may be concerned about the future of the Republican Party.
&#34;I would say to everybody who&#39;s inclined to support our right-of-center Republican Party, let&#39;s focus on winning the house and the Senate in &#39;22,&#34; McConnell said. &#34;That will set up the next nominee for president, whoever that may be, [with] the best chance to be victorious.&#34;

Freshman South Carolina Republican reflects on riot, election certification, impeachment on &#39;The Story&#39;
Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., described her first 100 hours on Congress as &#34;hell&#34; Monday, telling &#34;
The Story
&#34; that the deadly 
Capitol riot
, the fight over the 
Electoral College
 vote count and the second impeachment of President Trump represented an unbelievable series of events.
I couldn&#39;t imagine being in this situation in my lifetime ... it was heartbreaking and made me really angry,&#34; Mace, who unseated Democrat Joe Cunningham in November, told host Martha MacCallum.
&#34;I have spoken out strongly against the president and my own colleagues ... we have a Constitution as our guide. The vote to certify the Electoral College is in our Constitution,&#34; she said of the political battle that precipitated the riot. &#34;That was a ceremonial vote to certify all 50 states that were legally certified.&#34;
While Mace voted against objections to the election results in Arizona and Pennsylvania, she also voted against impeaching Trump on the single count of &#34;inciting insurrection.&#34; She argued that House Democrats had tarnished the tool of impeachment by rushing it to the floor for a vote.
TRUMP DOES NOT HAVE FUTURE IN REPUBLICAN PARTY AFTER CAPITOL HILL RIOT: REP. NANCY MACE
&#34;We bypassed the Judiciary Committee process,&#34; she said. &#34;So for anyone, that sets a very scary constitutional precedent. It&#39;s not something that should be rushed.&#34;
Mace added that there are &#34;constitutional questions about whether or not you can impeach a president, remove him from office when he&#39;s already out of office. He&#39;s going to be gone.&#34;
Mace said Senate leadership is sending &#34;mixed signals&#34; about whether they would break precedent and seek to convict President Trump.
&#34;There&#39;s questions [about] whether they&#39;re doing is constitutional, even having a trial and impeaching him when he is out of office ... It&#39;s basically shredding the Constitution,&#34; she argued. &#34;We have to be consistent in how we apply the Constitution across the board, and further, it will sow seeds of division. We&#39;re already divided as a nation. That will throw gasoline on the fire.&#34;

Mace, who invited her children to attend her swearing-in Jan. 3, told MacCallum that she immediately became concerned about the atmosphere ahead of the vote certification. 
&#34;Because of the rhetoric I saw from my colleagues, the president, the calls [coming] in our office, I felt like violence was going to be the outcome on the 6th,&#34; she said. &#34;I put my kids on the first plane home Monday morning. If they were there, I would have been devastated. It&#39;s personal for me.&#34;

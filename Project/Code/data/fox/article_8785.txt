Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argues there is a social and economic cost associated with migrants being sent to different states. 
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton pushed back on a New York Times report that quoted him hedging on whether he supports fellow Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.
In a lengthy report
, the Times claimed the Republican leadership in the iconically red state shifted its focus from &#34;trouncing&#34; state Democrats in 2020 to intraparty scuffles over coronavirus shutdowns and the responses to voter fraud allegations.
Paxton, a rising conservative star in the Lone Star State, has been a fervent supporter of former President Donald Trump, and as the paper noted -- and led an ultimately unsuccessful multi-state lawsuit seeking to overturn presidential election tallies in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Trump is &#34;clearly still the leader of the [Republican] Party,&#34; Paxton told the Times, as the paper described the state&#39;s lead position in the election lawsuit as &#34;invigorating&#34; his political career ahead of the 2022 statewide elections when Abbott is likely to seek a third term.
The Times had reported that Paxton &#34;seemed careful to distance himself from a governor whose legacy he once tried to emulate&#34; -- pointing to public criticism of Abbott&#39;s since-repealed pandemic-related economic lockdown orders.
&#34;I don&#39;t think he supports me; I don&#39;t support him,&#34; the Times quoted Paxton as saying – a comment the attorney general&#39;s office strongly disputed to Fox News.
Paxton&#39;s office told Fox News that the Times &#34;completely butchered 
[Paxton&#39;s] quote
&#34; about Abbott and took the attorney general &#34;out of context.&#34;
&#34;Statewide officials don&#39;t endorse other statewide officials in primary contests – it&#39;s just not done in Texas,&#34; a representative for Paxton told Fox News. 
&#34;We love the governor – we support the governor.&#34;
In response to the Times, Paxton himself tweeted that the paper&#39;s recollection of the interview is the latest &#34;fake news&#34; from the mainstream media.
&#34;Fake News NY Times strikes again,&#34; he wrote on Twitter. 
&#34;Let me be clear: I support Greg Abbott. He&#39;s a great governor and a great Texan.&#34;
The Times went on to report that current Texas GOP Chairman Lt. Col. Allen West -- a firebrand former U.S. congressman -- and State Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have not dismissed potential primary bids against Abbott.
Conversely, the 
Austin CBS affiliate
 reported that George P. Bush, the Texas Land Commissioner -- and the rare member of the Bush family 
to formally endorse Trump
 in 2020 -- is eyeing a run for attorney general next year.

Bush is the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who Trump defeated in the 2016 primary.
A recent poll
 also showed actor Matthew McConaughey -- who has been critical of both parties -- bested Abbott in a potential head-to-head. The actor originally hails from Uvalde, in the San Antonio area.

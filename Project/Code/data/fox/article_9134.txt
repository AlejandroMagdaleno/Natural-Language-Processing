Former House speaker tells &#39;Hannity&#39; why he is concerned about &#39;steady drift&#39; to a totalitarian government
Former President 
Donald Trump
 should focus on next year&#39;s midterm elections when he addresses the 
Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)
 this weekend, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told &#34;
Hannity
.&#34;
Trump, who is scheduled to address the annual gathering Sunday, will cast himself as the leader of the GOP and its &#34;presumptive 2024 nominee,&#34; 
Axios reported Monday
. The former president is also expected to call out the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, as well as the seven Republicans who voted to convict him, Axios claimed.
&#34;Every Republican ought to be focusing on, &#39;How do we make sure that [Rep. Kevin] McCarthy is the speaker of the House and that [Sen. Mitch] McConnell is the Senate majority leader?&#39;&#34; Gingrich told host Sean Hannity. &#34;Let&#39;s get through &#39;22. We&#39;ll have lots of time to talk presidency after 2022.&#34;
Gingrich added the address gives Trump the chance to &#34;rebrand himself&#34; after largely staying out of the public eye since President Biden&#39;s inauguration.

&#34;He has a wonderful opportunity here to ... communicate the strength of his policies and do it in a way which is positive and appearing, and a dramatic contrast to the confusion ... that seems to be the Biden standpoint,&#34; he said.
Gingrich also called for the removal of security fencing that has enclosed Capitol Hill since the deadly Jan. 6 riot.

&#34;I think it&#39;s an insult to every American to be told that their politicians are so important that they&#39;re gonna hide behind a wall while the rest of us are apparently in danger,&#34; he said. &#34;That&#39;s the opposite of a free society, and I am very worried by the steady drift toward an authoritarian -- and at times a totalitarian -- government.&#34;
&#34;I think this is profoundly wrong,&#34; Gingrich emphasized,&#34; and that that wall should come down immediately.&#34;

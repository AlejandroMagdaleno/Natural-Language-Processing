GOP California gubernatorial candidate joins &#39;Gutfeld!&#39; to discuss education, homelessness and whether he believes Newsom will be recalled
California
 gubernatorial candidate 
Larry Elder
 told a mostly maskless crowd inside a San Jose church this week that he would repeal 
coronavirus
 mask and 
vaccine
 mandates imposed by Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
 – if Newsom loses next month&#39;s recall 
election
 and Elder collects enough votes to replace him.
&#34;This man that I&#39;m going to defeat on September 14, he shut down the state in the most severe way than any of the other 49 governors have,&#34; Elder told the audience, according to San Francisco&#39;s KGO-TV. &#34;When I get elected, assuming there are still facemask mandates and vaccine mandates, they will be repealed right away and then I&#39;ll break for breakfast.&#34; 
Elder, a conservative radio talk show host, spoke at Calvary Chapel, whose leaders repeatedly defied indoor gathering restrictions last year and were fined more than $1 million, according to 
FOX 2
 of the Bay Area. 
LARRY ELDER&#39;S RADIO RHETORIC COULD BOOST HIM OR BUST HIM IN CALIFORNIA RECALL 
&#34;I know how difficult it is to run a business,&#34; Elder told the crowd. &#34;Many of them never succeed. Those who do succeed, often run on very thin profit margins, often from payroll to payroll. A third of all small businesses in California are now gone forever because [Newsom] ignored science.&#34;

Attendee Lynn Schultz told 
KGO
 she likes Elder.
&#34;He&#39;s a business guy, he&#39;s well-known, he&#39;s well-spoken and a lot of his ideas will fit well with the state,&#34; she said.
Lisa Disbrow said, &#34;We have an opportunity to get rid of a tyrant who just yesterday threw everyone connected to education under the vax bus,&#34; referring to Newsom&#39;s announcement that teachers will be required to get the vaccine or get tested regularly.

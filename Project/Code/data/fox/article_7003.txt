Everything to know about the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal funding from supporting abortions.
House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 defended Democrats&#39; current effort to eliminate the Hyde Amendment – which prohibits federal dollars from being used to fund most 
abortions
 – and invoked her own Catholic 
faith
 in the process.
The Catholic Church is firmly opposed to abortion, but Pelosi, who called the matter &#34;an issue of health of many women in America,&#34; said it is not up to her to tell other people what they can or cannot do.

He reversed his position during his campaign, leading to strong criticism upon his inauguration from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

&#34;I must point out that our new President has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender,&#34; Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, the organization&#39;s president, said. &#34;Of deep concern is the liberty of the Church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences.&#34;

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said earlier this month that Biden&#39;s newfound opposition to the Hyde Amendment is &#34;yet another way in which the administration has sold itself as moderate and unifying&#34; but &#34;is now spiraling way, way to the left.&#34;

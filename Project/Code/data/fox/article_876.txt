Former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany reacts to White House defense of Biden backing abortion. 
President Biden
 on Friday appeared to change a position he had just six years ago on whether 
life
 begins at conception.
His comments came during a press conference where he discussed Texas&#39; recently enacted abortion law.
&#34;I respect those who believe life begins in the moment of conception – I respect that,&#34; he told reporters. &#34;Don&#39;t agree but I respect that.&#34;
However, Biden indicated in 2008 and 2015 that he thought life began at conception. 
PRO-LIFE WOMEN BLAST PSAKI&#39;S ABORTION DEFENSE, ‘SEXISM’ TOWARD REPORTER
&#34;I’m prepared to accept that at the moment of conception there’s human life and being, but I’m not prepared to say that to other God-fearing, non-God-fearing people that have a different view,&#34; he 
said
 during an interview in 2015.
In 2008, he similarly 
said
: &#34;I’m prepared as a matter of faith to accept that life begins at the moment of conception.&#34;
It&#39;s unclear what changed but his statement came amid a whirlwind of controversy surrounding how Biden adhered to his Catholic faith in office. 
The 
section of the Catholic Catechism
 discussing abortion says that the procedure and infanticide &#34;are abominable crimes.&#34;
It reads: &#34;The inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and the political authority.&#34; The Catechism also warns that &#34;when the state does not place its power at the service of the rights of each citizen, and in particular of the more vulnerable, the very foundations of a state based on law are undermined.&#34;

Biden has long maintained that the government shouldn&#39;t force particular beliefs on Americans. That&#39;s part of the reason he supported the Hyde Amendment, which blocks federal funding for most abortions. But amid pressure in the 2020 campaign, he reversed his decades-old stance on the issue.
The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.

Transportation Secretary 
Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, best known for his 2020 run for the presidency, has largely stayed silent.

&#34;Participants identified multiple factors contributing to the congestion at the San Pedro Bay ports, but agreed that the situation is critical and committed to identifying and working toward solutions to increase throughput at the port in an environmentally sensitive way,&#34; the statement read.
Several culprits could be to blame for congestion prior to the holiday season, including supply chain disruptions due to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, analysts have said. The Transportation Department also blamed America&#39;s &#34;neglected&#34; infrastructure, calling for billions of dollars in additional investment in the nation&#39;s ports.

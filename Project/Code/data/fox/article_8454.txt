Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., called for the expulsion of Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., in a now-deleted 
tweet
 after a post falsely claiming a 2019 photo showed her with people who 
stormed the U.S. Capitol
 circulated online.
Jones wrote &#34;Expel her&#34; and shared the post purporting to link Boebert to the storming of the Capitol. But the photo was from a December 2019 
article
 in the Colorado Times Recorder, Daily Beast reporter Will Sommer 
pointed out
.
A spokeswoman for Jones told Fox News he still believes Boebert should be expelled despite deleting the tweet. Jones is considered a 
new ally
 of the so-called &#34;
Squad
&#34; of progressive 
Democrats
 in the 
House of Representatives

REP. BOEBERT, UNARMED DURING CAPITOL RIOT, BLASTS HOUSE FIREARMS RESTRICTIONS: &#39;MY LIFE IS WORTH DEFENDING&#39;
Boebert has been a lightning rod for controversy for many reasons since taking office last week. She has faced criticism for her insistence on carrying a firearm on Capitol grounds and 
tweeting
 &#34;Today is 1776&#34; hours before the riot at the Capitol.

Boebert criticized new safety measures in the Capitol following the riot, including metal detectors, as &#34;just another political stunt by Speaker Pelosi.&#34;
&#34;I am legally permitted to carry my firearm in Washington, D.C. and within the Capitol complex,&#34; Boebert wrote on 
Twitter
 on Tuesday. &#34;Metal detectors outside of the House would not have stopped the violence we saw last week — it’s just another political stunt by Speaker Pelosi.&#34;
She resisted allowing police officers to search her bag after she set off metal detectors on Tuesday, 
Colorado Public Radio
 reported. Boebert previously requested access to a gun locker from Captiol Police but was denied, the 
Colorado Times Recorder
 reported. Members are supposed to limit carrying firearms to their personal offices.

George state Rep. David Clark
 was reportedly booted from the House Chamber on Tuesday for allegedly refusing to get a

The spokesperson said Clark will be allowed to return to the Capitol &#34;upon complying with the policy for&#34; everyone’s safety. 
Clark said upon arriving at the chamber he was &#34;prepared to follow the required protocols by wearing a mask … having my temperature checked upon entry, and social distancing.&#34; 
He said he could not &#34;in good conscience watch expensive tests that should be given to Georgia citizens who desperately need them be wasted for nothing more than political optics at the Capitol.&#34;

A joint statement from Republican House Majority Leader Jon Burns and House Minority Leader James Beverly applauded the efforts of Ralston &#34;to preserve and protect the health and safety of the members and staff of the House of Representatives and all those who enter the doors of the Georgia State Capitol.&#34;
Writing on Twitter, Democratic Rep. Scott Holcomb said it was &#34;absolutely necessary&#34; for state lawmakers to get COVID-19 tests because they are indoors and &#34;can’t always social distance.&#34;

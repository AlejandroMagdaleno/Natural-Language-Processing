Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., discusses the upcoming impeachment trial of former President Trump on &#39;America Reports.&#39;
Former President 
Donald Trump
 will &#34;have a place in history&#34; for his role leading up to the 
riot at the U.S. Capitol
 last month, but he stills remains the &#34;most popular figure&#34; in the 
Republican Party
, 
Sen. Lindsey Graham
 said Sunday.
The 
South Carolina
 senator spoke on the impeachment effort against Trump on 
CBS’ &#34;Face the Nation,&#34;
 claiming that Republicans will view it as an &#34;unconstitutional exercise&#34; and that any trial will result in Trump’s acquittal.
TRUMP IMPEACHMENT IS &#39;PARTISAN FARCE,&#39; SCHUMER WOULD DESERVE TO BE IMPEACHED TOO: RAND PAUL
&#34;Forty-five plus Republicans are going to vote early on that it&#39;s unconstitutional,&#34; Graham said. &#34;It&#39;s not a question of how the trial ends. It&#39;s a question of when it ends.&#34;
Graham said that the longer it takes to get past impeachment, &#34;the worse off for the country.&#34;
Trump, who invited supporters to the nation&#39;s capital and told them the election could be overturned, did not commit a crime, according to Graham.
Despite this, Graham said that Trump is still the face of the GOP and that his policies &#34;served the country well.&#34;
&#34;He had a consequential presidency,&#34; the senator said. &#34;January the 6th was a very bad day for America, and he&#39;ll get his share of blame in history.&#34;

Graham said that Trump needs to &#34;rehabilitate himself as a politician,&#34; and believes that the GOP will come &#34;roaring back&#34; in 2022 as a result of the 
Democratic Party’s changes to immigration policy

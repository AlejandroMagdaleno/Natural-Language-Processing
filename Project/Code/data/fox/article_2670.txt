Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., on the impact of far-left politics in the military.
Rep. 
Dan Crenshaw
, R-Texas, and Senator 
Tom Cotton
, R-Ark., on Friday launched a whistleblower form for

&#34;Enough is enough. We won’t let our military fall to woke ideology,&#34; Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL, said in a Friday tweet. &#34;We have just launched a whistleblower webpage where you can submit your story. Your complaint will be legally protected, and go to my office and 
@SenTomCotton

Crenshaw added that &#34;with written permission,&#34; he and Cotton, a former Army captain, &#34;will anonymously publish egregious complaints on social media and tell the country what’s happening in our military.&#34;

REPUBLICANS SCRAMBLE TO STAMP OUT ‘WOKE’ POLITICAL BIAS, CANCEL CULTURE IN THE US MILITARY
Last week, House Armed Services Committee (HASC) member Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., 
decried cancel culture
 as &#34;getting out of hand&#34; and told Fox News that she was supporting legislation to ensure that American troops aren’t being indoctrinated into woke culture, which is more intolerant of conservative beliefs and values. 
In addition, HASC ranking member Mike Rogers, R-Ala., said in a 
news release
 that &#34;the United States Armed Forces should be focused on preparing to face and win any battles against the threats posed by China and other foreign adversaries and not imposing political beliefs on those who chose to serve in uniform.&#34;

The Navy also 
came under criticism
 in March after leaked slides from the military’s &#34;extremism&#34; training said sailors could not discuss &#34;politically partisan&#34; subjects on duty but that it was OK to advocate for Black Lives Matter while on duty.
The Navy revised their slides after multiple reports came out highlighting the political bias in the military branch’s training.

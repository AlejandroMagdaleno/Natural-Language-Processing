Philip Van Cleave, the president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League reacts to Democratic Governor Ralph Northam&#39;s state of emergency declaration ahead of a planned rally for Monday. Van Cleave also explains why he does not support universal background checks or bans on assault rifles.
Virginia’s
 House of Delegates cleared the way for the state to become the first in the South to abolish the death penalty. 
The House voted 57-41 to end capital punishment after the Senate had done so earlier this week. Two Republicans joined all Democrats in voting for the bill. Virginia’s Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam has said signing the bill is a top priority. 
There is still one unresolved disparity: the House bill reserves the right to punish the most serious crimes with life without the possibility of parole. The Senate bill allows some parole eligibility. 
&#34;The government should not be in the business of killing human beings. It&#39;s immoral, inhumane,&#34; Democratic Del. Marcus Simon representing Falls Church told WTTG, the Fox-owned station in Washington D.C. 
Republicans raised concerns about justice for the victims, and some perpetrators deserve &#34;the ultimate punishment.&#34; 
VA COUNTY PROHIBITS INFORMATION-SHARING WITH ICE 
&#34;If there’s one word to describe what happened to these victims, it is just cruelty. Unimaginable cruelty on a scale that’s hard to even process,&#34; he said.
Democrats said capital punishment is directly tied to institutional racism. 
&#34;The death penalty is the direct descendant of lynching. It is state-sponsored racism,&#34; said Del. Jerrauld Jones, D-Norfolk.
Capital punishment is currently authorized in 28 states.
The practice has significantly slowed down in recent years-- only two people are on death row in Virginia. The last execution took place in 2017 when William Morva was given a lethal injection for committing two murders. But since 1976 when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, Virginia trails only Texas in the number of executions -- 114. 
Also on Friday the House voted 55-42 to legalize marijuana, another first for Southern states. The Senate planned to vote later in the day on the matter. 
VIRGINIA COUNTY DENIED MORE THAN 900 ICE DETAINER REQUESTS OVER TWO YEARS: REPORT
Republicans opposed the bill
 for different reasons
 -- Del. James Leftwich, R-Chesapeake, said that legalized pot could lead to increased mental health issues in young people and more organized crime. Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, said he supports legalization but feels the current bill gives government too much power to interfere in the market. He said he was &#34;hopeful&#34; the measure could change in committee and he could vote for it.

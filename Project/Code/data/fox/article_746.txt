Mollie Hemingway: People need to be fired, people need to be court-martialed, people might need to be imprisoned for what&#39;s happening in Afghanistan
President Biden
 justified the withdrawal of American forces from 
Afghanistan
 by stating that U.S. troops should not be losing their lives in a conflict where the Afghans are not fighting themselves, but the last American military casualty was a year and a half ago.
&#34;American troops cannot and should not be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves,&#34; Biden said during a Monday address.

While the U.S. military has been engaged in Afghanistan for nearly 20 years, they have not suffered any loss of life in 18 months. The last Americans to die in battle in Afghanistan were Army Sgts. 1st Class Javier Gutierrez and Antonio Rodriguez, who both fell on Feb. 8, 2020.
Later that month, the Trump administration signed a conditional peace deal with the Taliban that called for the U.S. to withdraw by May 1, 2021, provided that Taliban forces comply with requirements including not allowing terrorists to operate in the areas that they had been occupying.

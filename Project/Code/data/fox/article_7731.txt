Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., discusses impeachment efforts, reflects on Trump’s legacy on ‘America’s Newsroom.’
Impeaching former 
President Donald Trump
 would be a &#34;huge mistake&#34; and would &#34;destroy&#34; the Republican Party, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on Wednesday.
&#34;My fear is that if Republicans, particularly Republican leadership goes along with this impeachment, they’ll destroy the party,&#34; Paul told &#34;
America&#39;s Newsroom
.&#34;
&#34;I think it is a hugely partisan exercise on the part of the Democrats. But for Republicans who go along with it, I think they will destroy our party. Donald Trump isn’t everything in the party but he did bring a lot of people to the party,&#34; Paul said.
Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for the second time in his presidency last week on an article of inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.
SEN. GRAHAM URGES BIDEN TO &#39;STAND DOWN&#39; ON &#39;SCARLET LETTER&#39; TRUMP IMPEACHMENT
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on the House floor before the vote on 
impeachment
 that Trump &#34;must go&#34; and that he is &#34;a clear and present danger,&#34; but remarks from her colleagues indicate they are concerned about what they view as a potential future threat. Trump is now out of office, making the idea of removing him moot, but opponents are eager to disqualify him from any future run.
&#34;One of the other purposes of impeachment, in this case, is to make sure that President Trump is not able to run for federal office again, that he’s not able to seek the presidency,&#34; Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, told 
ABC&#39;s &#34;This Week&#34;
 on Sunday.

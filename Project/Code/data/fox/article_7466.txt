Fox News contributor Joe Concha reacts to a widely panned interview of White House press secretary Jen Psaki by CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter.
White House
 press secretary Jen Psaki sparred with a reporter Friday over the issue of transparency on breakthrough 
coronavirus
 cases among 
Biden
 administration staffers.
&#34;This administration has long claimed that you’re trying to be the most transparent in history. If that&#39;s the case why don’t you just release the number of breakthrough cases that you have with 
vaccinated
 staffers?&#34; Psaki was asked.

The press secretary responded by saying the U.S. was in a &#34;very different place&#34; than it was six or seven months ago and touted the efficacy of vaccines in lessening the severity of coronavirus symptoms if a breakthrough case occurs.
The reporter then pressed Psaki again for a specific answer.
&#34;Why not just provide the number?&#34; Psaki was asked. &#34;Are you trying to hide something?&#34;
Psaki shot back, &#34;Why do you need to have that information?&#34;
PSAKI DEFENDS HUNTER BIDEN&#39;S PARTICIPATION IN ART SHOWS: &#39;NO SCENARIO&#39; IN WHICH BUYERS CAN &#39;PROVIDE INFLUENCE&#39;
&#34;Transparency,&#34; the reporter explained. &#34;The interest of the public. A better understanding of how breakthrough cases work here in the White House.&#34;
Psaki again declined to provide the specific number and instead outlined how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks breakthrough cases across the country.

Psaki said during the news briefing that White House staffers were 
not required
 to take the vaccine.
Earlier in the week, Psaki 
confirmed
 an Axios
 
report that multiple breakthrough positive coronavirus cases had popped up among White House staffers but dodged a question as to whether or not she would have disclosed that information had the press not reported it first.
Six Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled their state for Washington, D.C. to meet with federal lawmakers and  avoid voting on an election integrity bill have 
tested positive for the coronavirus
. 
At least one staffer each for President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also tested 
positive
 for the virus after coming in contact with Texas Democrats.

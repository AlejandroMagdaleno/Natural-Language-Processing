Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker previews the former president’s address, discusses the GOP’s future on ‘CAVUTO Live.’
In his first major public appearance since leaving office, former 
President Donald Trump
 is expected to call for unity in the Republican Party when he addresses the 
Conservative Political Action Conference
 on Sunday.
Despite friction among GOP leaders following the electoral vote objections and U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6, Trump will be looking to help bring the party together, according to an excerpt of the speech obtained by Fox News.

It remains to be seen whether Trump will fire back at any other Republicans who opposed him before, during, or after his impeachment.
He and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had traded harsh criticisms of one another, although McConnell 
told Fox News
 on Thursday that should Trump run again in 2024 and win the Republican nomination, he would &#34;absolutely&#34; support him.

Don Jr. slams media&#39;s &#39;disgusting&#39; coverage of Cuomo nursing home scandal on &#39;Hannity&#39;
Donald Trump Jr. accused the media on Monday of protecting embattled New York Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 because he &#34;was willing to speak poorly about 
my father
.&#34;
Trump&#39;s eldest son told &#34;
Hannity
&#34; that the media gave the Democrat a &#34;pass&#34; over his controversial nursing home directive that led to thousands of deaths in the state&#39;s senior care facilies, choosing to focus instead on the mounting allegations of sexual assault against the governor.
TRUMP JR.: This [the nursing home scandal] is probably the bigger scandal, although it seems like perhaps the Democrats are sweeping that under the rug in lieu now of the accusations against our groper-in-chief as governor of New York.
This kind of stuff is disgusting, Sean. It has gone on too long. The Democrats get a pass. They only go towards Democrats. If there was a Republican in this situation, whether it was one scandal, both scandals, a fraction of the scandal, this would have been over a long time ago.
The former president&#39;s eldest son blamed the media for making Cuomo out to be &#34;a hero&#34; because of his eagerness to publicly criticize the Trump administration&#39;s handling of the coronavirus pandemic:

TRUMP JR.: &#34;They made him a deity ... because he was willing to talk poorly about my father, they gave him a throne and they let him do his thing. It was a joke and it was a sham and I think we are starting to realize that now.&#34;
When asked whether he would consider challenging Cuomo in next year&#39;s New York gubernatorial election, Trump Jr. answered plainly:
I think you need someone who is a fighter ... [but] I just have no interest in that job.&#34;

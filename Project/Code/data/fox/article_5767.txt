North Carolina Republican and Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett react to video of maskless Nancy Pelosi on &#39;Hannity&#39;
A new super PAC has been formed in North Carolina that is looking to &#34;fire&#34; Rep. 
Madison Cawthorn
, R-N.C., in the 2022 midterm 
elections
, but the freshman congressman says he&#39;s taking the PAC&#39;s launch as proof that he&#39;s doing his job.
The &#34;Fire Madison Cawthorn&#34; PAC was launched on Monday by Cawthorn&#39;s Democratic opponent from 2020, Col. Moe Davis, and Democratic state Senate candidate David Wheeler.
According to a press release, the super PAC has the &#34;sole purpose of firing a Member of Congress,&#34; which the organization says is the first super PAC in western 
North Carolina
 to have that specific aim.
MADISON CAWTHORN&#39;S DEM OPPONENT COMPARES CONGRESSMAN TO GUANTANAMO BAY DETAINEES
&#34;The non-profit and IRS registered Super PAC&#39;s sole purpose is to raise funds to focus on the callous and child-like actions of U.S. Representative David (Madison) Cawthorn,&#34; the release reads.
In a statement to Fox News, Cawthorn said that he knows that he is doing his job if he is &#34;hated in Washington, D.C.&#34; and &#34;despised and derided by corporate lobbyists and Super PACs of the radical left.&#34;
&#34;If I am loved by those who back the blue, if I have earned the support of those who plow the fields and raise a family in North Carolina, I know I am doing my job,&#34; he continued. &#34;Washington, D.C. hates me, because they fear you.&#34;
&#34;These left-wing socialists can call me what they want, but they did not call me to this position,&#34; the Republican congressman said. &#34;The people of Western North Carolina have my six and that&#39;s the only backup I will ever need.&#34;
Wheeler, one of the Democrats behind the PAC, said that many people in Cawthorn&#39;s district have given the congressman &#34;the benefit of the doubt, hoping that maybe he would be a member of Congress for us all, and it&#39;s clear that he has one agenda, and it&#39;s himself.&#34;
&#34;So, Col. Davis and I, and others, decided to do what Americans do, which is to try and influence the government,&#34; he continued. &#34;And we feel we can certainly do better here in Western North Carolina than Madison Cawthorn.&#34;
Wheeler claimed the catalyst for the super PAC was Cawthorn’s &#34;endorsement of the January 6th insurrection&#34; at the U.S. Capitol as well as his &#34;absolute loyalty and love for Donald Trump and his inability to understand he represents all of us, not just those that voted for him.&#34;
&#34;And then you top it off with the fact that three months into his tenure, he gets two weeks off and goes on vacation in Dubai,&#34; Wheeler said. &#34;A place that he rails against, ironically, because it’s a Muslim country and he sits around drinking beer for two weeks while the rest of us are stuck in a pandemic looking for help and he callously heads off to Dubai.&#34;
It was reported that Cawthorn was honeymooning with his new wife in Dubai after his wedding. The congressman 
defended
 missing votes during his honeymoon, saying it was his &#34;service as a husband.&#34;
Following the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, 
Cawthorn said
 the Republican Party had a &#34;lesson to learn&#34; from the implications of the GOP’s election fraud claims and called the riot &#34;sickening and infuriating.&#34;

&#34;As one of the very first Republican freshmen Congressmen to pass legislation in the 117th Congress, Rep. Cawthorn has championed the interests of veterans across the district,&#34; Cawthorn&#39;s communications director, Micah Bock, told Fox News. &#34;From rural broadband reform, to rebuilding local businesses in the post-Covid economy, Rep. Cawthorn has introduced a number of powerful legislative initiatives that put Americans first.&#34;
Bock added that Cawthorn &#34;serves as a champion of free expression and liberty&#34; and that it came as &#34;no surprise that embittered liberal activists have been weaponized by the Democrat machine in Washington in an effort to silence his voice.&#34;

Florida governor joins &#39;Life, Liberty &amp;amp; Levin&#39; to discuss his administration&#39;s response to the pandemic
&#34;Flawed assumptions&#34; about overcrowded hospitals led states like
 New York
 to order 
coronavirus
-postive patients into nursing homes during the early days of the pandemic, 
Florida
 Gov. Ron DeSantis told &#34;
Life, Liberty, &amp; Levin
.&#34;
&#34;We looked at the data that we had from other parts of the world as we were getting into March, and we saw that this was a virus that had a disproportionate impact on elderly people and we&#39;re the second-oldest state in the country, so that was something that was obviously very concerning to us,&#34; the Republican told host Mark Levin.
DeSantis explained that state officials took &#34;action to protect vulnerable people as best as they could.&#34;
&#34;One of the things we did, I think, before any other state was protect nursing homes. So we prevented people from visiting for a time,&#34; DeSantis said.

&#34;But then, I think more importantly, we barred hospitals from discharging sick nursing home residents back into the nursing homes,&#34; he added. &#34;As you know, other states did the opposite and ordered those patients back. We viewed that as something that would be very hazardous.&#34; 
The full interview with DeSantis airs Sunday night at 8 p.m. ET on Fox News Channel. 
In addition to being the third-most populous state in the country, DeSantis pointed out, 4.5 million Florida residents -- nearly a quarter of the state&#39;s population -- are at least 65 years old.
&#34;At the time, there was actually a lot of movement to send the nursing home residents back because people said, &#39;Oh, you&#39;re going to run out of hospital beds, you&#39;ve got to clear the hospitals,&#39; and I looked at a lot of those models ... and I didn&#39;t think that they were worth the paper they were printed on. They were based on flawed assumptions,&#34; he said. &#34;They were not being validated in real time by what we were observing on the ground in Florida. So I said, &#39;You know what? If I have to build field hospitals all across the state, I will do that before I send these patients back into nursing homes and endanger all these elderly people.&#39;&#34;
New York Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo

Last month, New York Attorney General Letitia James said nursing home COVID-19 deaths in the state were undercounted by as much as 50%. Matters escalated after 
a top aide to Cuomo told state Democratic lawmakers
 that the administration had withheld data on nursing home deaths out of concern over a federal investigation.
Last year, Cuomo directed New York nursing home to accept patients who had or were suspected of having COVID-19. The decision created an onslaught of COVID-19 cases in thousands of elderly patients and resulted in hundreds of deaths among the state&#39;s most vulnerable population.

Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer joins ‘America Reports’ to discuss top Democrats joining the fight against California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recall. 
Facing a 
recall election
 Tuesday that could soon leave him without a job, California Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
 has been pointing to Texas as an example of where the Golden State is headed if Republicans take over, according to a report.
While campaigning last week, Newsom, a Democrat, made reference to a new Texas 
abortion
 law that many liberals fear could lead to the U.S. 
Supreme Court
 overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion in America.
&#34;The whole idea that a constitutional right, the right to choice, the right to reproductive freedom, rights of women, now are under assault – what a remarkable moment it is in American history,&#34; Newsom told a campaign crowd, FOX 11 of Los Angeles reported.

Americans moving to Texas more than any other state. We’re also # 1 in business relocations. Texas policies attract people more than any other state.&#34;
Abbott’s Sept. 5 message was accompanied by a link to a Forbes story that reported California has lost 265 business headquarters since 2018, with the pace of relocations appearing to be accelerating.
Forbes noted that 2020 showed California’s population had declined for the first time in history, costing it a seat in Congress. The population drop was reported by the state&#39;s Department of Finance,

An increasing number of 
Republican senators
 say they oppose holding an impeachment trial for former 
President Trump
.
Sen. 
Marco Rubio
, R-Fla., told &#34;Fox News Sunday&#34; that the upcoming trial of Trump is &#34;stupid&#34; and harmful for the U.S., even if he was responsible &#34;for some of what happened&#34; at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
&#34;Well, first of all, I think the trial is stupid. It’s counterproductive,&#34; Rubio said Sunday. &#34;We already have a flaming fire in this country, and it’s like taking a bunch of gasoline and pouring it on top of the fire.&#34;
House Democrats will walk the impeachment charge of &#34;incitement of insurrection&#34; to the Senate on Monday evening. They hope that strong Republican denunciations of Trump after the Jan. 6 riot will translate into a conviction and a separate vote to bar him from holding office again.

&#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39; host takes a deeper look into the California Democrat&#39;s use of campaign funds 
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.
, likened Sen. 
Ted Cruz
, R-Texas, and Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, to 
WWE
 wrestlers, suggesting that in front of cameras they are merely putting on a show for their fans. 
Swalwell, 40, made the comments about his 
GOP colleagues
 during an appearance on the MeidasTouch podcast. 
&#34;It’s pro wrestling, to be honest,&#34; Swalwell said. &#34;Many of my colleagues are better suited to work at the WWE.&#34; 
In a clip of the interview, Swalwell suggested he once had a cordial working relationship with Gaetz &#34;before Trumpism took off,&#34; but Gaetz &#34;turned into a character.&#34; 
&#34;There were times where he would laugh at himself, you know, to keep, you know, the act going. That’s what’s so frustrating,&#34; Swalwell said.
If someone were to run into Gaetz, Jordan, or Cruz at the Santa Monica Pier, he said, they would seem like &#34;nice guys&#34; and nothing like how they supposedly portray themselves on Twitter or TV.

&#34;To him, if you’re a pro wrestler, like it doesn’t matter that you hit me over the head in the ring with a steel chair. It’s all fake, right? You’re just doing what the fans want. So, I should just be cool with it because he projects on to me what he does. He thinks that I’m just performing as well. And that’s what’s most sickening. I don’t even know what these guys believe.&#34; 
SWALWELL SPENT THOUSANDS OF CAMPAIGN DOLLARS ON BOOZE AND LIMO SERVICES, $20K AT HOTEL WHERE HIS WIFE WORKED
In response, a spokesman for Gaetz accused Swalwell of name
-
checking Gaetz, Jordan, and Cruz &#34;because they are the most effective Republicans in Congress.&#34; 
&#34;It’s rich to be compared to a WWE wrestler by a man who 
rides camels shirtless
 through the desert in between meetings with terrorists,&#34; the spokesman said.

President offers words of admiration for the Michigan Democrat during speech at Ford plant
An ally to Rep. 
Rashida Tlaib
, D-
Mich.
, runs an organization that the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) says has &#34;provided a platform for anti-Semitism.&#34; 
University of California at Berkeley instructor Hatem Bazian is a Tlaib ally and donor who is also a co-founder and professor at Muslim liberal arts school Zaytuna College. In 2006, Bazian 
founded
 a controversial, advocacy organization named American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), which has featured Tlaib at events.
Tlaib was the &#34;
guest of honor
&#34; at AMP&#39;s annual convention in December 2019 and months earlier in July 
delivered
 a briefing organized by AMP to over 70 people. The Michigan Democrat also 
addressed 
AMP&#39;s Palestine Advocacy Day delegates in April of 2019.
Three years earlier in October 2016, Tlaib was a 
headliner
 for the Islamic Scholarship Fund that also included controversial activist Linda Sarsour – who 
left the board
 of the Women&#39;s March in September 2019 over accusations of anti-Semitic rhetoric – when 
Bazian
 was on the board of the organization.
‘SQUAD’ MEMBER RASHIDA TLAIB CLAIMS ISRAEL ‘PROMOTING RACISM AND DEHUMANIZATION’ UNDER ‘APARTHEID SYSTEM’
AMP has been 
described
 by the left-leaning ADL as an organization that &#34;promotes extreme anti-Israel views and has at times provided a platform for anti-Semitism under the guise of educating Americans about ‘the just cause of Palestine and the rights of self-determination.&#39;&#34;
Bazian also 
donated
 $500 to Tlaib&#39;s campaign in March and gave another $500 in 2019. In addition to Tlaib, Bazian has also donated to Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Barbara Lee, D-Calif.
After donating to Tlaib&#39;s campaign, Bazian called on his 
Facebook
 friends to do the same, sharing a link to the Michigan congresswoman’s campaign website.

In March of 2013, AMP put up a billboard accusing Israel of engaging in &#34;apartheid&#34; against Palestinians. Both Tlaib and Omar were 
featured 
as speakers for a virtual AMP event in November 2020, and both congresswomen 
attended 
the same pro-Palestine conference as Bazian.
RASHIDA TLAIB LISTED AS SPECIAL GUEST FOR EVENT HOSTED BY CONTROVERSIAL, ALLEGEDLY ANTI-SEMITIC ACTIVIST
AMP Twitter has 
paid tribute
 to controversial figures, including Zahra Billoo, the former Women&#39;s March board member who was kicked off the organization’s board for anti-Semitic 
tweets
.
Billoo was 
kicked off
 the Women&#39;s March board after previous posts deemed to be anti-Semitic resurfaced online. Billoo 
called Israel 
an &#34;apartheid, racist state&#34; that &#34;engages in terrorism against Palestinians&#34; in 2018 and 
tweeted 
in 2012 that U.S. troops are &#34;engaged in terrorism.&#34;
Tlaib also referred to Billoo as &#34;
sis
&#34; on Twitter while pushing the Free Palestine movement.
&#34;They won&#39;t silence us for speaking out against human rights violations,&#34; Tlaib said on Twitter. &#34;They will lie, smear our names and call us anti this and that, but we always be pro- humanity &amp; we have the truth on our side. Stay strong, [Billoo].&#34;
RASHIDA TLAIB SILENT ON ALLY&#39;S CALL TO STOP CONDEMNING ANTI-SEMITISM
According to Canary Mission, an anti-Semitism watchdog, Bazian has retweeted 
multiple anti-Semitic tweets
, including 
one
 that shared an image of an Orthodox Jewish man with the caption, &#34;MOM LOOK! I IS CHOSEN! I CAN NOW KILL, RAPE, SMUGGLE ORGANS &amp; AND STEAL THE LAND OF PALESTINIANS *YAY* ASHKE-NAZI.&#34;
Bazian also claimed during a MAS-ICNA 
convention speech
 in 2014 that the U.S. Congress is an &#34;Israeli-occupied territory.&#34;
The professor also told college attendees to push the anti-Israel boycott, divestment, sanctions (BDS) movement on campuses.

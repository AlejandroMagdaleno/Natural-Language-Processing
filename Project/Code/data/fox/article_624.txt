Rep. Nicole Malliotakis addresses the border crisis: &#39;it&#39;s not just a humanitarian crisis, but it&#39;s also a national security crisis&#39;
The 
Biden
 administration has pulled more than $2 billion out of programs authorized by Congress for COVID-19 testing, emergency medical supplies and other health needs — and is spending it on shelter for the 45,000 unaccompanied migrant children that have flooded across the US border this year.
The Department of Health and Human Services siphoned $850 million out of funds allocated for testing in President Biden’s massive $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, 
Politico reported Saturday
.
Secretary Xavier Becerra pulled $850 million more out of a fund meant to replenish the Strategic National Stockpile of items like medical gloves, masks, antibiotics and ventilators, and yanked $436 million out of other health programs, according to HHS spokesman Mark Weber.

plead for another $905 million
 to be pumped into the pandemic-depleted stockpile.
The news of the cash diversion had Republicans — who have blamed the spiraling border crisis on Biden’s 
executive orders rolling back
 President Trump’s strict immigration policies — fuming.
&#34;The President single-handedly created this crisis and is now misplacing billions in taxpayers’ money,&#34; Rep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) told The Post.

&#34;The answer to every problem is not to throw money at it,&#34; said Malliotakis, who 
excoriated Biden
 after visiting the border in April. &#34;In this case, it’s simply rescinding his executive order, reinstating President Trump’s border protocols, and going after the cartels and smugglers.&#34;
In recent weeks, a Texas nonprofit 
won two HHS no-bid contracts
 totaling nearly $620 million to provide &#34;emergency intake&#34; services for migrant children shortly after hiring a former Biden aide.

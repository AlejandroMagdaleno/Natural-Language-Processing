Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-
Iowa
, is pushing the State Department to release &#34;all records&#34; related to 
President Biden&#39;s
 climate envoy John Kerry&#39;s potential conflicts of interest after Kerry&#39;s financial disclosure documents revealed he and his wife recently sold off stake in oil and 
energy
 companies.
&#34;[R]eports indicate that Mr. Kerry has signed an ethics pledge barring him from participating in specific policy matters that would create a conflict with his former clients and employers,&#34; Grassley wrote in a 
letter
 to Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
BIDEN ADMIN SLOW-WALKED RELEASING JOHN KERRY&#39;S FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES FOR WEEKS
&#34;However, it&#39;s unclear exactly what matters Mr. Kerry has been barred from working on and whether he has received any waivers for specific matters that he would otherwise be recused from,&#34; continued Grassley, who is ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Grassley is demanding all records, including emails related to evaluations of Kerry&#39;s potential or actual conflicts of interest, all matters that Kerry is recused from and any waivers related to such of interests by May 17.

Kerry is one of the richest members of the Biden administration, and financial disclosure documents show that his wife 
owned fossil fuel-related stocks
 even as he traveled the world preaching about the existential threat of 
climate change
. 
In addition to a $5 million from Bank of America he received in the last year or so, Kerry received $125,000 in consulting fees from 
The Rise Fund
, a private investment firm focused on environmental and social impact, an honorarium payment of $45,000 from Deutsche Bank and an honorarium payment of $90,000 from Zurich Insurance Company.
IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER APOLOGIZES FOR LEAKED COMMENTS ON JOHN KERRY, OTHER ISSUES
&#34;The Department respects the role of Congress and does not comment on Congressional correspondence,&#34; a State Department spokesman told Fox News.
As special presidential envoy for climate, Kerry has called for corporations to move away from fossil fuels and is reportedly 
pushing
 major banks to create a net-zero emissions banking alliance.
Kerry is &#34;the first-ever principal to sit on the National Security Council entirely dedicated to climate change,&#34; according to his State Department 
bio
.
Kerry, the former secretary of state, lieutenant governor and senator from Massachusetts, and an unsuccessful 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, is worth far more than most lifelong politicians.

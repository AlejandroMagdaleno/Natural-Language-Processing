A video of a father and his daughter speaking out against 
critical race theory
 has gone viral amid an ongoing national debate on the topic.
The video posted by 
TikTok user Kory Yeshua
 shows him sitting next to his unnamed daughter and saying he teaches her she can be anything she wants to be.
&#34;It doesn’t matter if you’re black or white or any color,&#34; the girl says while a somber tune plays in the background.
Yeshua regularly posts conservative videos critical of Democratic policies and Yeshua has said the BLM organization is for &#34;the destruction of America and the destruction of our families.&#34;
UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS HIT BACK AGAINST OPPONENTS OF CRITICAL RACE THEORY
He tells his daughter in the viral clip, &#34;How we treat people is based on who they are and not what color they are.&#34;
The girl adds &#34;and if they’re nice and smart.&#34;
&#34;This is how children think right here,&#34; Yeshua responds. &#34;Critical race theory wants to end that. Not with my children, it’s not going to happen.&#34;
When the girl tells the viewer they can make friends, Yeshua ties that CRT again.
&#34;We need to stop CRT,&#34; he says. &#34;Period. Point blank. Children do not see skin color, man. They love everybody.&#34;
The video gained 26,000 views since it was posted to TikTok on May 19, but it racked up 1.6 million 
views on Twitter
 when it was shared by Republican congressional candidate Robby Starbuck.

Democratic Reps. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 of New York, 
Ilhan Omar
 of Minnesota and 
Cori Bush
 of Missouri have yet to weigh in on 
Black Lives Matter
 declaring its support for Cuba&#39;s communist regime, even though the congresswomen have been vocal BLM supporters in the past. 
Black Lives Matter sparked a backlash late Wednesday after posting a statement that blasted the U.S. embargo and praised Cuba&#39;s government.
ILHAN OMAR SAYS AMERICA, LIKE HAMAS AND THE TALIBAN, HAS COMMITTED ‘UNTHINKABLE ATROCITIES’
&#34;The people of Cuba are being punished by the U.S. government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination,&#34; the statement said. &#34;United States leaders have tried to crush this Revolution for decades.&#34;
The statement also credited Cuba&#39;s government for &#34;protecting Black revolutionaries like Assata Shakur,&#34; a convicted cop-killer who fled to Cuba after escaping from prison in 1979. BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors has 
repeatedly praised
 Shakur in the past. 
Ocasio-Cortez and Omar are vocal supporters of BLM, while Bush was a 
BLM activist
 before joining Congress. 
&#34;In Minnesota, Black Lives Matter was on the ballot. George Floyd was on the ballot. Racial justice was on the ballot,&#34; Omar wrote in a 
tweet
 after the November election. &#34;The result? Record turnout, a swing towards Democrats and gains in the suburbs.&#34; 
The congressional offices for Omar, Ocasio-Cortez and Bush didn&#39;t immediately return Fox News&#39; requests for comment.

BLM isn&#39;t the only group allied with AOC to have praised the oppressive Cuban regime. The 
Democratic Socialists of America
 (DSA), which counts Ocasio-Cortez and Bush among its members, appeared to signal its support for the Cuban regime this week. 
The DSA International Committee on Monday 
declared
 its solidarity with the &#34;Revolution&#34; – the term used by the communist regime – &#34;in this moment of unrest.&#34; The DSA&#39;s national arm also 
echoed
 Cuba&#39;s president in blaming America&#39;s trade embargo with the communist regime for the unrest.

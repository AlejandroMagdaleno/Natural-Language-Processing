The White House denies the border crisis as it struggles to house migrants; Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, reacts on ‘America Reports.’
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told 
&#34;America Reports&#34;
 Friday that the 
Biden
 administration has &#34;miscalculated&#34; the

We&#39;ve seen this movie before during the Obama administration, and you would have thought that the Biden administration, which was part of the Obama administration, would have learned. But I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s the politics or just the incompetence of this administration. That seems to be the rule of thumb, that whatever Trump&#39;s policies were, you do the opposite whether it makes sense or not, and that seems to be what&#39;s happening here.

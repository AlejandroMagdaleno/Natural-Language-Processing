Missouri
 Senate hopeful Eric Schmitt, who is currently the state&#39;s 
Republican
 attorney general, said this week that he has already raised more than $1 million ahead of the 2022 race.
 &#34;We&#39;re off to a really good start. I mean, we raised a million dollars in a pretty short period of time. The support&#39;s been great. And we&#39;re going to continue to work hard because we can&#39;t lose Missouri,&#34; Schmitt said in a 
podcast interview
 on Thursday.

&#34;I&#39;ve won statewide twice by 18 points and then 22 points. But those Senate races are always much closer than that. And a flawed candidate can lose Missouri. We&#39;ve seen that happen. Republicans lose. I mean, even [Sen.] Josh Hawley, you know, who&#39;s doing a fantastic job, won by six points, and [Sen.] Roy Blunt won by three points,&#34; he continued.
Schmitt&#39;s team confirmed to Fox News that they raised the money over the last seven weeks.

&#34;The support&#39;s been tremendous and we&#39;re working hard,&#34; Schmitt told &#34;Ruthless&#34; podcast. &#34;Somebody told me long time ago, you run unopposed or scared, right? And so you just work as hard as you possibly can. And I think, again, having been around the state, people know me. The support has been really overwhelming. And that&#39;s what it&#39;s going to take to hold on to the seat, because the Democrats will look for any opening whatsoever to try to make people have to play in a state like Missouri. &#34;
Other Republicans in the race include Eric Greitens and 
Mark McCloskey
. Greitens was Missouri&#39;s 
governor
 from 2017 to 2018. Greitens resigned as governor in 2018 amid allegations of sexual misconduct – which he denied – and charges that he used a veterans charity he set up to fundraise for his gubernatorial campaign. The charges of violating campaign finance laws were dropped in a deal he struck with prosecutors.
Blunt 
announced
 in March that he would not seek reelection in 2022. 
Blunt said in a video that &#34;after 14 general election victories – three to county office, seven to the United States House of Representatives, and four statewide elections – I won’t be a candidate for reelection to the United States Senate next year.&#34;
Blunt was first elected to the Senate in 2010 after serving as GOP whip during his 14 years in the House.
Missouri was once a competitive state for both parties, but has trended Republican in recent decades.

Former Sen. Claire McCaskill’s 2012 victory was the last time a Democrat won a Senate election in the state.
McCaskill, who lost her 2018 reelection bid to Josh Hawley, made it clear that she would not run for Blunt&#39;s seat.
&#34;To all that are asking: thank you to the many who have said kind things. But I will never run for office again. Nope. Not gonna happen. Never. I am so happy I feel guilty sometimes,&#34; she wrote on 
Twitter
 on March 8.

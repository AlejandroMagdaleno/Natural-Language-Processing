&#39;Hannity&#39; host rips president and press secretary following slew of executive orders
&#34;
Hannity
&#34; host Sean Hannity labeled 
White House
 Press Secretary Jennifer Psaki a &#34;propagandist&#34; on Friday in his opening monologue and pointed to the fact 
President Biden
 made adamant remarks last year that to rule by executive order would be governing like a &#34;dictator.&#34;
Hannity said that Psaki has likely not immersed herself in the communities of Middle America while the administration &#34;with the stroke of a pen&#34; cancelled the Keystone XL Pipeline, and with it the thousands of high-paying union jobs from Alberta, Canada to Texas.
&#34;So much for the unity that 
Joe Biden
 promised. Instead of bringing Americans together, he does quite the opposite,&#34; Hannity said. &#34;In fact, he seems perfectly content to go it alone. As of now, Joe Biden has signed a record of 40 executive orders and counting.&#34;
&#34;He says &#39;this isn&#39;t a dictatorship -- you&#39;ve got to get the [congressional] votes, this is a democracy.&#39; He&#39;s not trying to get to Congress to get his agenda passed, he&#39;s ramming it down our throat with a stroke of a pen, altering people&#39;s lives in ways that are so damaging.&#34;
&#34;According to the White House press secretary, propagandist Jen Psaki, Joe just loves bipartisanship,&#34; the host continued. &#34;These are words, this is not true.&#34;
He pointed to a recent interview between Psaki and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow in which the presidential spokeswoman claimed Biden wakes up every morning wanting to find ways to reach across the political aisle.
&#34;He starts every day thinking, &#39;I want to be able to work with Democrats and Republicans, and there&#39;s a reason they should work with me.&#39;d Are Republicans now against reopening schools? Are they against getting unemployment insurance checks to the American people? Are they against getting vaccines in the arms of Americans?&#34; she asked.
Hannity dubbed the comments &#34;fascinating,&#34; and opined that Psaki does not know how the working class lives:

&#34;No, Jen, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever spoken to anyone outside of your little D.C. Bubble, so let me fill you in: Hardworking men and women are against prisoners at Gitmo -- apparently next week -- being pushed to the front of the vaccine line. That&#39;s not America First,&#34; he said. 
&#34;They are against shipping doses of the vaccine overseas to other countries before every American in this country has a chance to get the vaccine first,&#34; he continued, adding that this and other developments show that Biden has turned former President Donald Trump&#39;s &#34;America First&#34; policies into &#34;America Last.&#34;
He said that American enemies like Iran are going to become wealthier with Biden&#39;s actions in killing the pipeline, adding it will no longer allow America to be energy independent.
The host further added that Democrats writ large are wasting America&#39;s time on the Trump impeachment trial, calling it a &#34;Schiff Show&#34; -- in reference to Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a prominent impeachment manager, and pointing out reports that the riot at the Capitol was planned days before the ex-president spoke on the White House Ellipse.
&#34;Democrats are wasting the entire country&#39;s time like they have for five years, they are wasting your money, and it&#39;s all an effort to smear Donald Trump into his supporters,&#34; Hannity said.

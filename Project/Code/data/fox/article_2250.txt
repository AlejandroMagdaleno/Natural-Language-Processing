Florida GOP Rep. Kat Cammack, whose husband is a veteran first responder, sounds the alarm on Democrats’ reform bill on ‘Fox &amp;amp; Friends’ 
A new Democratic police reform bill would effectively defund 
police
 officers and deprive them of life-saving equipment, Florida GOP Rep. Kat Cammack said on Friday, after her speech slamming the Democrats&#39; 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act
.
&#34;When you talk about this so-called reform bill that the Democrats call it, it&#39;s just a call to defund police. And what so few people across the country know is that this vest and so many other pieces of critical life-saving equipment come from the 1033 program, which gets labeled as a militarization of our department,&#34; Cammack told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
.&#34;
Cammack’s husband Matt is a 14-year department veteran of local first responders in Gainesville. He is a firefighter and medic.
&#34;And you actually see behind me right here, this is his other SWAT vest because he is a 
SWAT
 medic, not just for the sheriff&#39;s office, but also for Gainesville Police Department, in addition to being a firefighter. He truly is a public servant,&#34; Cammack said.
FLORIDA CONGRESSWOMAN SLAMS DEMS&#39; POLICE BILL: &#39;ARE YOU WAKING UP AT 2 AM TO RESPOND TO A GRUESOME MURDER?&#39;
Cammack on Wednesday criticized Democrats&#39; 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act
, or H.R. 1280.
The legislation would overhaul standards for police tactics and conduct at the federal level, including a federal ban on no-knock warrants and chokeholds, limits on qualified immunity shielding police from civil lawsuits, a framework to prevent racial profiling, and the establishment of a national registry on allegations of police misconduct.
&#34;This bill was named after a man who was murdered by a police officer,&#34; Cammack began. &#34;The officer responsible should have never been allowed to don a badge and act on behalf of the agency sworn to protect its citizens ... As a member of the first responder family, I can say definitively on behalf of our officers, that there is absolutely nothing ... that a good cop hates more than a bad cop.&#34;

Cammack blasted the notion that a SWAT vest is &#34;militarized equipment,&#34; saying it was &#34;lifesaving&#34; for rural departments.
&#34;Why are we pushing a bill that does that, meaning taking this kind of equipment off of my husband&#39;s back and so many others when there is real reforms that we can make to make our police departments better and stronger, more responsive?&#34; Cammack said.
Cammack concluded that &#34;this is just a backdoor attempt to defund the police.&#34; 
&#34;I&#39;m terrified for my husband&#39;s life as well as the lives of so many men and women in uniform across this country,&#34; she said. &#34;They have been under attack for so long. We have got to have their six now more than ever. And that is why I just felt so compelled to get on the House floor and speak out.&#34;

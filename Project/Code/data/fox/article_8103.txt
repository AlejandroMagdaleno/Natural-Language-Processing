Moody&#39;s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi says the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package President Biden has proposed is &#39;a good step.&#39;
Senate Majority Leader 
Chuck Schumer
 said Thursday that Democrats are prepared to pass President Biden&#39;s massive 
coronavirus relief package
 without GOP support if Republicans don&#39;t recognize that &#34;big&#34; action is needed.
Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats will begin considering a &#34;very strong COVID relief bill&#34; as soon as next week with or without Republicans on board.
&#34;Our preference is to make this important work bipartisan -- to include input, ideas and revisions from our Republican colleagues or bipartisan efforts to do the same,&#34; Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday morning. &#34;But if our Republican colleagues decide to oppose this urgent and necessary legislation, we will have to move forward without them.&#34;
BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS SKEPTICAL ABOUT BIDEN&#39;S $1.9T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PROPOSAL
Legislation in the Senate typically takes 60 votes to advance, but Schumer and incoming Budget Committee Chairman Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., are proposing using a process called budget reconciliation that would allow the package to pass with a simple majority vote rather than bipartisanship.
The Senate is currently split 50-50, with Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking 51st vote.
Schumer pointed to new &#34;sobering&#34; economic reports on the weakening pace of the economic recovery from the Federal Reserve, high jobless claims and news Thursday 
that the U.S. economy shrunk 
by 3.5 percent last year -- making 2020 the worst year for economic growth since 1946.
WHAT&#39;S IN BIDEN&#39;S $1.9T STIMULUS PLAN?
&#34;Given these economic numbers, the need to act big and bold is urgent,&#34; Schumer said.
He said there&#39;s a greater risk in going too small, rather than too big. Congress must not repeat the &#34;mistake&#34; from 2009 when lawmakers were &#34;too timid&#34; in responding to the global financial crisis, which prolonged the recession, Schumer said.

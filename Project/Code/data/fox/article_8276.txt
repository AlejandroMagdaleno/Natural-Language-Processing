&#34;By signing executive orders to ban oil, gas and coal production on federal lands, to kill the Keystone XL Pipeline and to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, the president will throw thousands of Americans out of work,&#34; he said according to the 
The Detroit News
. &#34;Their livelihoods are being sacrificed in the name of the Biden agenda.&#34;
&#34;I can&#39;t in good conscience confirm her to this position knowing that that&#39;s the approach this administration is taking,&#34; said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, according to The Detroit News. &#34;By executive fiat, they are jeopardizing American energy independence and security and they&#39;re devastating much of Utah&#39;s economy. I can&#39;t support that and will reluctantly vote against her.&#34;
Other senators praised Granholm.
&#34;I can think of no one better than Governor Granholm to be Energy Secretary during this transformative period for our country,&#34; Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., wrote on Twitter. &#34;She has been a steadfast advocate for clean energy her entire career and I have no doubt she&#39;ll bring the same passion to this role.&#34;
Republicans Sens. Richard Burr, Susan Collins, Kevin Cramer, Mike Crapo, Steve Daines, John Hoeven, Ron Johnson, Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, Rob Portman, James Risch, Mitt Romney, Mike Rounds and Todd Young 
voted
 in favor of Granholm.

More than 150,000 people in California are homeless, the most of any state, according to 2019 data from the National Alliance to End Homelessness, the news service reported.

Santa Ana Mayor Vicente Sarmiento, a Democrat, said there needs to be a &#34;proportional response&#34; to such a &#34;big&#34; issue.

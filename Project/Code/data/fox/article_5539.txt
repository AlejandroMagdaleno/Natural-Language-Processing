Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., slams New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s handling of nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic, noting that Democrats have also ‘had enough.
Rep.
 Lee Zeldin
, R-N.Y., argued on Wednesday that New York 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo
 &#34;completely misplayed us from the beginning&#34; when it came to the nursing home scandal during the 
coronavirus
 pandemic. 
&#34;Rather than apologizing, saying that he made a mistake, showing remorse, choosing to confront it head on, early on he decided to cover it up and then he lied to the public about it,&#34; Zeldin told &#34;
The Faulkner Focus
&#34;.
&#34;He said the reason why he wasn&#39;t providing this information was that he was too busy,&#34; he continued. &#34;The problem is at the same time, what we saw earlier this month, was the admission from 
Melissa DeRosa,
 the secretary to the governor, that the reason why this information wasn&#39;t provided was because they were concerned about a 
Department of Justice
 investigation.&#34;
A new 
Marist College survey
 has found that 
61 percent
 of New York&#39;s registered voters &#34;perceive some wrongdoing&#34; in Cuomo&#39;s order for nursing homes to accept COVID-positive patients.
CUOMO PUSHES BACK ON DEM CRITIC RON KIM OVER NURSING HOME SCANDAL
Zeldin called the survey a sign that &#34;the public is also well aware that while the governor is saying that he’s too busy to provide the information, he had time to write a self-congratulatory 
book on leadership
 and of course accept his 
Emmy
 award on communication.&#34;

However, the Republican added, &#34;you’re seeing the chickens coming home to roost with 
Democrats
 speaking up on what they’ve experienced on the receiving end of Gov. Cuomo&#39;s wrath.&#34; 
&#34;He’s completely misplayed us from the beginning and that’s why you&#39;re seeing those poll numbers,&#34; Zeldin continued.

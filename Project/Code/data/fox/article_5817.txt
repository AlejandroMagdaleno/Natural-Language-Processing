Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., a longtime foe of former President 
Donald Trump
, will not run for re-election to a fourth term in 2022 as a long list of left-wing candidates are vying to take his place. 
&#34;When I ran for this job in 2009, I said that a District Attorney’s responsibilities should extend beyond obtaining convictions in court, and that a 21st century prosecutor’s mandate is to move our justice system and our community forward,&#34; Vance, 66, said in a statement on Friday.

Vance&#39;s office touted his focus on justice reform in a 
press release

Vance&#39;s office also touted Trump v. Vance, in which the 
Supreme Court
 ruled that Trump was not immune to a subpoena from Vance over his financial and tax records, and People v. Weinstein, which led to the downfall of entertainment mogul Harvey Weinstein.

&#34;I never imagined myself as District Attorney for decades like my predecessors,&#34; Vance said in a statement. &#34;I never thought of this as my last job, even though it’s the best job and biggest honor I’ll ever have. I said twelve years ago that change is fundamentally good and necessary for any institution. Having secured these lasting impacts in our communities, our public policy, and our crimefighting capacity­­, the time has come to open the pathway for new leadership at the Manhattan D.A.’s Office.&#34;

Vance is a 
Democrat
, and the 
race to replace him
 is already shaping up to be about radical change as candidates embrace substantial sentencing reform, promise not to prosecute a host of low-level offenses and introduce plans for &#34;decarceration.&#34;

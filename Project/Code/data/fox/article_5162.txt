Former House Speaker joins &#39;Special Report&#39; to discuss his career and disagreements with fellow Republicans
Former 
House Speaker
 
John Boehner
 revealed the reason for his 
public vitriol 
toward Sen. 
Ted Cruz
, R-Texas in a wide-ranging interview on &#34;
Special Report
&#34; Tuesday.
&#34;The guy was always stirring up trouble with some of the knuckleheads in my caucus,&#34; Boehner told &#34;Special Report&#34; host Bret Baier.
Boehner explained that while he got along well with most of his Republican colleagues during his time on Capitol Hill, there were roughly &#34;30 of them that weren&#39;t conservative -- I&#39;m a conservative Republican -- they were knuckleheads and Ted Cruz came over and kept winding them up to do crazy things that have never had a chance of becoming law.&#34;
&#34;All you will do is cause problems and so over the years, I’ve just decided, screw Ted Cruz.&#34;
BOEHNER TELLS CRUZ TO &#39;GO F- YOURSELF&#39; WHILE RECORDING AUDIO BOOK: REPORT
Boehner
 made headlines earlier this week after he told Cruz to &#34;go f--- yourself&#34; in a 
leaked 
audio recording. In a subsequent interview with CBS, Boehner explained that he doesn’t typically like to &#34;beat anyone up&#34; but that he’d make an 
exception 
for Cruz.
Boehner and Cruz have been publicly trading barbs since February. The senator mocked Boehner&#39;s penchant for alcohol in a tweet last weekend, claiming to wear the former speaker&#39;s &#34;drunken, bloviated scorn&#34; proudly.
&#34;I think he was probably recording at nine or ten in the morning so obviously he had too much wine that day already,&#34; Cruz told the Daily Caller on Saturday. &#34;This guy is a little unhinged.&#34;
Boehner, an Ohio Republican who served as House speaker from 2011-2015, has been promoting his 
book, 
&#34;On The House: A Washington Memoir.&#34; 
The feud continued on Tuesday when Cruz posted a photo of Boehner&#39;s book -- which refers to him as &#34;Lucifer incarnate&#34; --  resting in his Senate office fireplace, with a caption that read, &#34;Some smart-ass dropped off a copy of Boehner’s new book at my office. It’s even signed! I filed it in the appropriate place.&#34;
&#34;I&#39;m pretty good to most people in the book, but Ted Cruz gets the worst of it,&#34; Boehner admitted.
Elsewhere in the interview, the former speaker revealed that he &#34;still has doubts&#34; about whether the Obama administration was truthful with the American people about the 2012 Benghazi attack that claimed the lives of four Americans. 
&#34;No one is going to ask you this question except here,&#34; Baier said. &#34;What happened? Who was responsible? Did you learn anything from the investigation, do you regret going down that road?
&#34;No, I don&#39;t at all,&#34; Boehner responded, &#34;because I still have doubts about what happened with Benghazi. I think Trey Gowdy and his committee did as good a job as they could do given the information they were allowed to receive, but I tell you what, there are questions about this that bother me, because I am not at all sure that everything couldn&#39;t have been done to save the lives of those Americans who died.&#34;
Reflecting on his career at a later point in the interview, Boehner admitted that his &#34;greatest disappointment&#34; during his time in Congress was not doing more to reduce the U.S. deficit, which required direct consultation with the Obama administration.

&#34;I wish we could&#39;ve gotten there,&#34; he told Baier. &#34;We would&#39;ve put America on a path forward, but it didn&#39;t happen ... but we did cut the deficit five consecutive years. 
&#34;While I was speaker, Barack Obama was president and Harry Reid was [Senate] Majority Leader for most of that time, so there is a way to handle the spending issue but at some point, you&#39;ve got to pay the piper.&#34;

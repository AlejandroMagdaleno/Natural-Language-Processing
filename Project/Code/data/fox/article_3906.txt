Four protesters were arrested outside 
New York 
Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo’s
 Manhattan office Wednesday after they blocked incoming traffic along Third Avenue. 
Drawing off the twin scandals dominating the headlines, Cuomo’s nursing home death undercount and sexual misconduct allegations, the demonstrators demanded the governor’s resignation for his response to homelessness, overdoses and the prison system. 
The protesters were members of VOCAL-NY, a group that has protested multiple times outside the governor’s office.

The aide whose wedding reception 
was the venue that led to a sexual-harassment allegation
 against Gov. Andrew Cuomo is leaving the state’s COVID-19 task force, he said Wednesday.

&#34;Last week as I approached one year since moving to Albany to join the NYS Covid task force, I decided it was time, given the progress of the vaccination program and continued decline of Covid numbers, to return to my previous role at the Department of Financial Services and I informed the Governor’s senior staff at the time,&#34; Rhodes’ statement said.

Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 announced Thursday that the Democratic National Committee is making a $25 million investment in countering GOP legislation and laws tightening voting requirements.
The new spending measure is a part of an &#34;I Will Vote Campaign&#34; as the party heads into the 2022 midterm elections and looks to maintain the higher rate of voting that occurred during the 2020 general election.

&#34;This is the fight of our nation’s lifetime,&#34; Harris said during an event at Howard University in Washington, D.C., a historically Black college and her alma mater.

And that is because our democracy is strongest when everyone participates, and it is weaker…when people are left out.&#34;
The funds are set to be used to boost voter registration and teach voters about local legislation introduced by state Republican lawmakers along with changes that have been made since voters last hit the ballot boxes.

Harris and President Biden also met Thursday with civil rights leaders to discuss voting in the U.S., along with criminal justice reform.
Democrats face mounting pressure to address voting rights in the U.S. following the Supreme Court’s ruling to uphold voting restrictions enacted in Arizona.
Supreme Court Justice 
Samuel Alito
 argued that Arizona’s new voting regulations were merely &#34;quintessential examples of the usual burdens of voting.&#34;
But Harris said Thursday that the 28 new voting laws implemented across the U.S. served one purpose – to &#34;make it harder for you to vote.&#34;

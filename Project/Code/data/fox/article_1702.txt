House Minority Leader 
Kevin McCarthy
, R-Calif., ripped 
President Biden’s decision
 to waive sanctions on the Russia-backed Nord Stream 2 pipeline, arguing the move would hurt the U.S. economy and geopolitical interests.
In a letter to Biden dated Monday, McCarthy and other GOP House members expressed &#34;strong objections&#34; to his administration’s decision to lift sanctions on the Germany-to-Russia pipeline. The lawmakers said the pipeline’s completion would be a &#34;gift&#34; to Russian President Vladimir Putin following what they described as a &#34;cyber terrorist attack&#34; that crippled Colonial Pipeline, a key U.S. fuel supplier.
&#34;This action, which will send more Russian natural gas to Europe, also puts U.S. resources at a distinct competitive disadvantage, costing American jobs and reducing America’s geopolitical influence,&#34; the lawmakers said.
Biden lifted sanctions on Nord Stream AG and its top executive, a longtime Putin associate, in a move that critics said would fast-track the pipeline for completion. Republican lawmakers have accused Biden of hypocrisy, given his decision by executive order to halt construction of the U.S.-based Keystone XL pipeline due to environmental concerns.
BIDEN PAID ‘COST OF ADMISSION’ FOR PUTIN SUMMIT, REP. MCCAUL SAYS
McCarthy and his co-signatories, Reps. Garret Graves, R-La., Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., and Andy Barr, R-Ky., noted that Biden’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said during his confirmation hearing that he was &#34;determined&#34; to halt the Nord Stream pipeline.
&#34;Given your open hostility to domestic pipelines like the Keystone XL pipeline, which also was a top priority for our Canadian allies, it is baffling that you are willing to green-light Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline,&#34; the lawmakers added. &#34;The Keystone XL pipeline would enhance our energy security and create job opportunities for Americans.&#34;

&#34;Lifting these sanctions, however, prioritizes Russian energy over American energy and Russian jobs over American jobs.&#34;
Biden, who had previously opposed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, said the imposition of sanctions &#34;would be counterproductive now in terms of our European relations.&#34; 
German officials have supported the project.
Biden is slated to meet with Putin later this month.
&#34;We urge you to rethink your action and fully implement the Congressionally mandated sanctions against all responsible parties and actors to permanently stop completion of Nord Stream 2,&#34; the lawmakers added.

Former 
Obama
 
White House
 Counsel Neil Eggleston predicted Thursday that Justice Stephen Breyer isn&#39;t going to retire from his 
Supreme Court
 seat just &#34;because somebody bought a van&#34; advocating that he do so, an apparent swipe at left-wing Demand Justice activists who did just that. 
Eggleston was asked during a Federalist Society virtual event to respond to the recent efforts by some left-wing activists to get Breyer to step down so that President Biden can name a replacement for him before the 2022 midterms. 
&#34;When I was White House counsel I thought about this in connection to Justice Ginsburg,&#34; Eggleston said. He acknowledged that one of his former White House colleagues, Christopher Kang, is a co-founder of Demand Justice, the group leading the charge to get Breyer to step down. 
But Eggleston said that he decided against making such a move in his role as the White House counsel, the person responsible for Obama&#39;s judicial nominees. 
LIBERALS RAMP UP CALLS FOR SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BREYER TO RETIRE AFTER HE PANNED COURT PACKING IN SPEECH
&#34;I just decided that I had nothing to add to the information she already had… I never talked to the president about it but I just thought, &#39;I&#39;m not gonna do it, I&#39;m not gonna call her and suggest to her that it&#39;s time for her to step down,&#39;&#34; Eggleston said. &#34;It&#39;s unseemly and I&#39;m not gonna do it.&#34; 
He added: &#34;I kind of had the same reaction to this. I think Justice Breyer doesn&#39;t need the liberal media and those sort of people – progressives like me are not turning on him, he&#39;s in our view a fantastic justice... he&#39;s gonna make whatever decision he&#39;s gonna make.&#34;
&#34;I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to decide to retire because somebody bought a van with ‘Retire, Breyer’ in writing around the Supreme Court,&#34; Eggleston added. 
In early April, Kang&#39;s group Demand Justice did in fact buy a van with a billboard that said &#34;Breyer, Retire… Don&#39;t risk your legacy,&#34; on it. 
The van and stepped-up calls for Breyer&#39;s retirement came shortly after the justice slammed the concept of court-packing in a speech to Harvard Law students and alumni. 
&#34;If the public sees judges as politicians in robes, its confidence in the courts and in the rule of law can only diminish, diminishing the court&#39;s power, including its power to act as a check on other branches,&#34; he said. 
&#34;That authority, like the rule of law, depends on trust... that the court is guided by legal principle, not politics,&#34; he continued. &#34;Structural alteration motivated by the perception of political influence can only feed that latter perception, further eroding that trust. There is no shortcut.&#34;

Eggleston made the comments during a Federalist Society forum on judicial nominations and confirmations under President Biden. Among the other panelists were Judicial Crisis Network President Carrie Severino.
&#34;I agree with Neil, it&#39;s unseemly,&#34; Severino said of the effort to get Breyer to step down. &#34;I think if anything that response, especially coming as it did almost immediately after Breyer&#39;s own rejection of court-packing… I don&#39;t think that&#39;s appropriate and I think it also risks further politicizing that seat.&#34; 
Justices will often announce their retirements around the conclusion of a term of the court, meaning if Breyer were planning a retirement his announcement should be expected within approximately the next month.

Vice President Kamala Harris&#39;
 office is scrambling to reassure 
pro-Israel
 Democrats after she failed to push back against a student who accused Israel of &#34;ethnic genocide.&#34;
The controversy stems from an incident 
Wednesday
 in which a student attending an event to promote voting told Harris Israel was committing &#34;ethnic genocide&#34; in Palestine and argued the U.S. was ignoring protests despite promoting the power of democracy.
KAMALA HARRIS APPLAUDS STUDENT WHO ACCUSED ISRAEL OF ‘ETHNIC GENOCIDE,&#39; FOR SPEAKING ‘YOUR TRUTH’
&#34;Your voice, your perspective, your experience, your truth cannot be suppressed, and it must be heard,&#34; Harris told the student.
The remarks prompted immediate backlash from the Israeli press, which ran headlines such as, &#34;Kamala Harris doesn’t reject US student’s ‘ethnic genocide’ claim against Israel.&#34;
Members of Harris&#39; staff have been working behind the scenes with pro-Israel groups and lawmakers on damage control, with one senior staff member contacting the Democratic Majority for Israel to reaffirm the vice president&#39;s commitment to the country.
&#34;We were pleased Vice President Harris’s senior staff reached out to us today to confirm what we already knew: Her ‘commitment to Israel’s security is unwavering,’&#34; said Mark Mellman, the group&#39;s president.
A senior adviser also reached out to Rep. Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat who co-chairs the Bipartisan Anti‐Semitism Taskforce, according to Politico.
Deutch&#39;s office did not respond to a Politico request for comment on the issue, but a source told the outlet that it was &#34;fair to say that the group of House Democrats that super care about this noticed it and talked about it.&#34; The same source said that Harris&#39; office also reached out to Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt on Thursday.

Mellman said Harris&#39; senior staff reassured his organization that Harris &#34;strongly disagrees with the George Mason student’s characterization of Israel.&#34;
&#34;The Biden-Harris Administration, as well as President Biden and Vice President Harris personally, have exemplary pro-Israel records, for which we are immensely grateful,&#34; Mellman said.

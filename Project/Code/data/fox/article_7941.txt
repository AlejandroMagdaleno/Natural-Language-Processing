Democrat Ron Kim decries governor&#39;s &#39;egregious actions&#39; on &#39;The Story&#39;, responds to news conference
A New York Democratic lawmaker blasted 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo
&#39;s &#34;egregious&#34; cover-up of the 
nursing home scandal
 Monday, calling for a thorough investigation into his administration&#39;s failure to protect the state&#39;s most vulnerable population. 
The governor&#39;s 
nursing home 
debacle returned to the headlines last week when his top aide, Melissa DeRosa, admitted on a call with Empire State Democrats that the administration had withheld the true number of 
COVID-19
-related deaths at nursing homes from DOJ investigators over fears that the data could &#34;be used against us,&#34; as first reported by the New York Post.
Assemblyman Ron Kim told &#34;
The Story
&#34; on Monday that DeRosa &#34;implicated all of us listening in to that call to their cover-up.&#34;
LIVE UPDATES: CUOMO NURSING HOME SCANDAL
&#34;As state lawmakers, this is not about being a Democrat or Republican or whichever party you&#39;re from. We have a moral duty to speak up against their egregious actions and hold everyone involved accountable, including the governor,&#34; Kim told host Martha MacCallum.
Cuomo defended the data reporting in a news conference earlier Monday, telling reporters that &#34;all the deaths in nursing homes and hospitals were fully, publicly and accurately reported.&#34; The governor also claimed there was a &#34;delay&#34; in releasing the data because his administration was busy managing the pandemic response.
&#34;If there&#39;s nothing to hide, why didn&#39;t they hand over the information when we asked for it?&#34; Kim said. &#34;The information was available. They could have just disclosed it. But they chose not to, so there&#39;s a distrust among the public right now.&#34;
CUOMO BROTHERS ACCUSED OF SHOWBOATING WHILE THOUSANDS OF SENIORS DIED
Kim, who lost an uncle to the coronavirus in a New York senior care facility, called for a &#34;thorough investigation&#34; to provide the &#34;15,000 families that lost loved ones and the families that have loved ones at the nursing homes still suffering ... a sense of justice and trust again in our state&#39;s ability to protect them.&#34;

&#34;I do believe we need a thorough investigation, whether that be [an] independent commission or the [state] attorney general or the federal government,&#34; Kim said, &#34;and that needs to happen as soon as possible.&#34;

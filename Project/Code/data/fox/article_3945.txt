 Rep. Matt Gaetz on Sunday defended Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-
Colo.
, and discussed the treatment of conservative women during an interview with Real America&#39;s Voice.

Gaetz said that metal detectors were placed outside of the chamber due to Boebert&#39;s views. &#34;That was all you,&#34; he said, adding that Democrats felt threatened by her.

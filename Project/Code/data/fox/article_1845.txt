HBO host mocks left-wing nuttery
Comedian Bill Maher slammed &#34;woke&#34; culture and said that defunding the police and ignoring the theory that the coronavirus came from a Chinese lab due to fear of being called racist are examples of how &#34;wokeness&#34; will &#34;get people killed.&#34;
&#34;Let me give you an example, you said you think it doesn’t get anybody killed? I think it does,&#34; Maher said on &#34;Real Time&#34; Friday night. &#34;Defunding the police I think came from wokeness and it will get people killed.&#34;
BILL MAHER SAYS &#39;SLEAZY&#39; CUOMO NEEDS TO GET OUT: &#39;THIS IS WORSE THAN RALPH NORTHAM&#39;
Maher added that he believes the refusal from major news outlets, specifically the New York Times, to cover the theory that the coronavirus came from a Chinese lab is another example of &#34;wokeness&#34; getting people hurt. 
&#34;The Spectator says that 
The New York Times
 ‘refused to investigate’ [what] they call, ‘the biggest story of our time,’&#34; Maher said. &#34;They’re talking about where the virus originated, maybe it was in the Wuhan lab. Because — they ‘suppressed efforts to probe the virus’ origins’ for, among reasons, because they thought it was racist.&#34;
BILL MAHER SHREDS CANCEL CULTURE: &#39;IT BELONGS IN STALIN&#39;S RUSSIA&#39;
Maher continued, &#34;You see, because everything is race, come on, at The New York Times. And so, the paper of record is not reporting what I would expect the paper of record to report, the accurate news. That is an example of the power of wokeness. Yes, it does have power. So, it’s not just one-sided. It’s just not as bad [as authoritarianism on the right].&#34;
Earlier in the show, Maher 
called
 
on embattled New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to resign following a report concluding he sexually harassed multiple women and said the scandal is worse than the blackface controversy that surrounded Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam.

&#34;How is he still there?&#34; Maher asked. &#34;What does he think is gonna happen? Like, why would you stay at this moment? It&#39;s been a whole week since the report came out. They&#39;re going to impeach him if he doesn&#39;t leave. Wouldn&#39;t you rather go on your own accord? Wouldn&#39;t you rather be, ‘You can’t fire me, I quit&#39; then get impeached in a week?&#34;

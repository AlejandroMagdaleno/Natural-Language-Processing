&#39;Outnumbered&#39; panel reacts to MLB pulling the All-Star Game from Georgia over the state&#39;s new voting laws.
Sen. 
Tim Scott
, R-S.C., accused 
Democrats
 of &#34;terribly&#34; distorting the facts around 
Georgia&#39;s
 new voting law at an event in South Carolina on Saturday.
&#34;How can you distort the facts so terribly that you&#39;re willing to bring back the concept of a poll tax or the concept of Jim Crow? You only do that when you have nothing to stand up, you bring up a provocative and ugly racial past that does not exist ... in today&#39;s America. Thank God that it doesn&#39;t,&#34; Scott told the Berkeley County Republican Party, according to video posted by 
Forbes

GEORGIA VOTING LAW: READ FULL TEXT
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, ignited a firestorm by signing the new law last week. The Washington Post 
fact-checked
 President Biden for his claims about the law.
&#34;What I’m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It’s sick. It’s sick,&#34; Biden said. &#34;Deciding that you’re going to end voting at 5 o&#39;clock when working people are just getting off work.&#34;
Biden also called the Georgia law &#34;Jim Crow on steroids.&#34;
Scott pushed back against Biden&#39;s claims.
&#34;It says the polling hours are 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Now I know President Biden has some challenges. The truth might be one of them. Five p.m. is a lie. It&#39;s 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and on a[n] additional Saturday voting day, it was different hours,&#34; he said.
GEORGIA GOV KEMP HITS MLB, BIDEN AFTER ELECTION LAW PROMPTS ALL-STAR MOVE: NOTHING MORE THAN &#39;POLITICAL PLAY&#39;
&#34;The Georgia law, very basic, says that we are going to expand your access to the polls,&#34; Scott said.
He jabbed at Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastian, who blasted Georgia&#39;s new law last week.

&#34;I want everybody to vote,&#34; Scott said. &#34;I encouraged and supported the voter ID laws we have in this state. I think they&#39;re fantastic. Thirty-six, 37 states have voter ID laws because if you need — we should tell the Delta CEO this by the way — if you need an ID to get on a plane, you should need an ID to vote. They have exceptions if you don&#39;t have IDs.&#34;
Scott also criticized Democrats&#39; H.R. 1 bill, which deals with elections.

&#34;What H.R. 1 says is that we want to nationalize the elections,&#34; Scott said. &#34;Our Founding Fathers said don&#39;t nationalized elections. H.R. 1 says, &#39;Let&#39;s do this, this is a cool idea. Let&#39;s take your money and put it into my campaign account involuntarily.&#39;&#34;
&#34;It makes ballot harvesting, that should be illegal everywhere, legal everywhere. It makes mail-in ballots without signature verification, without any way of knowing who&#39;s voting, the law of the land. That&#39;s wrong,&#34; he said.

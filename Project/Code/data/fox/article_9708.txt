How long will the trial last?
It&#39;s not clear how long the trial will last, but it&#39;s expected to be much shorter than the former president&#39;s first three-week-long impeachment trial. 
Trump’s acquittal is likely, as 67 senators would have to vote in favor of impeachment for a conviction -- and most Republicans (who have 50 seats in the Senate) have indicated they are against the trial. Still, senators will have to remain in the chamber and listen to hours of testimony from House Democrats as they relay the events that occurred when pro-Trump protesters breached the Capitol and tie the president’s election fraud claims to the violence and unrest. 
Then-President Trump was impeached in the House on Jan. 13. The final vote was 232-197, with 10 Republicans joining all Democrats to vote for impeachment.

Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., House impeachment manager, requested last week that Trump testify at the trial after his legal team denied any involvement in the Capitol breach, and Trump immediately denied the request. Trump&#39;s legal team has argued the trial is unconstitutional after a president is out of office and doubled down on the president&#39;s claim of election fraud.

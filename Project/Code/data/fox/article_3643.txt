Gov. Kristi Noem argues backlash against the motorcycle event in South Dakota was &#39;all politics&#39; from the left
Social media users piled on to Dr. 
Anthony Fauci
 for what many felt was a double standard when it comes to what type of gatherings he criticizes.
&#34;No comment from St. Fauci on Obama’s soirée last night with a few hundred of his closest friends - or how about 
Lollapalooza last week in Chicago
,&#34; one social media user said in reaction to Fauci&#39;s comments critical of the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. &#34;Or, I guess it’s SELECTIVE festivities, because the virus knows, and only attacks those who fit the Dems’ narrative.&#34;
The remarks came in response to Fauci&#39;s comments expressing concern about South Dakota&#39;s upcoming Sturgis Motorcycle Rally on Sunday&#39;s &#34;Meet the Press,&#34; with host Chuck Todd speculating the rally could become a &#34;super spreader&#34; event.
&#34;I&#39;m very concerned, Chuck, that we&#39;re going to see another surge related to that rally,&#34; Fauci said. 
Fauci admitted that it was &#34;understandable&#34; that people &#34;want to do the kind of things they want to do,&#34; though he called on rallygoers to consider their impact on the spread of 
COVID-19
.
&#34;There comes a time when you&#39;re dealing with a public health crisis, that could involve you, your family, and everyone else that something supersedes that need to do exactly what you want to do,&#34; Fauci said.
But many social media users pointed out that Fauci did not share the same type of concerns when it came to other high-profile events.
&#34;I have come to loathe Fauci. I cannot believe I fell for this fraud for even a minute,&#34; one user said. &#34;Lollapalooza: Nothing. Obama birthday party: Nothing. Riding a motorcycle in the free air: SATAN&#39;S DEVIL VIRUS WILL GET YA!&#34;
&#34;Love how you can catch covid only at certain events. Did it disappear last weekend at the Lollapalooza in Chicago &amp; yesterday at Obama&#39;s birthday party,&#34; another user said. &#34;Why do people still believe anything that comes out of Fauci&#39;s mouth?!&#34;
Others argued that with a vaccine widely available, it was time for authorities to stop regulating such gatherings.
&#34;There is a universally available, free vaccine that is 99.999% effective at preventing death,&#34; said commentary writer Drew Holden. &#34;The pandemic is over. People need to get back to living.&#34;
The annual biker bash has been the subject of media scorn for two consecutive years, causing South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to defend one of her state&#39;s marquee events.

&#34;The media lied about the event for a year,&#34; Noem 
told
 
&#34;Fox &amp; Friends&#34;
 in May. &#34;They&#39;ve labeled it as a super-spreader. That was not true. We continuously pushed back. And I&#39;m glad that some of those facts are coming to light. It’s all political. We did testing in that community for weeks afterwards.&#34;

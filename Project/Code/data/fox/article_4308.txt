Kentucky senator sounds off on Chicago’s mandates causing the city to prepare for possible police shortage.
The city council in Tucson, 
Arizona
, voted to terminate city employees who refuse to take a 
COVID-19
 
vaccine jab
, a move that Gov. Doug Ducey, R-Ariz., condemned as &#34;unfathomable&#34; as he suggested he would challenge legally.
The city council voted 4-3 on Tuesday to approve a mandate that city employees get vaccinated or lose their jobs by Dec. 1, the 
Associated Press reported
. Around 300 of the city&#39;s nearly 4,000 employees have refused the shot as of last week.
NEW YORK CITY POLICE UNION THREATENS LEGAL ACTION OVER DE BLASIO VACCINE MANDATE
&#34;It’s unfathomable that after a year as tough as last, the Tucson City Council voted to FIRE unvaccinated city employees,&#34; Ducey wrote of the policy. &#34;The state Legislature has spoken on this issue — they want Arizonans and their sincerely held beliefs to be protected from overreaching mandates.&#34;

Ducey wrote a letter to Tucson City Attorney Mike Rankin, noting that Arizona law requires employers to &#34;provide a reasonable accommodation&#34; if an employee cites sincerely held religious beliefs as a reason for not taking the vaccine. 
He said public reports did not suggest that Tucson&#39;s vaccine mandate includes such an accommodation and warned that this legal requirement remains in effect, even though 
some parts of the law
 banning vaccine mandates were struck down as unconstitutional.
&#34;I took an oath to uphold Arizona’s laws and ensure they are faithfully executed, and I will continue to do so,&#34; Ducey declared. &#34;My office has informed the City of Tucson that their policy is in conflict with the law and, as such, should be rescinded.&#34;
Ducey ended his message by encouraging &#34;all Arizonans to get the vaccine against COVID-19,&#34; calling the jab &#34;the best way of keeping you and your loved ones safe.&#34;

Many Republican governors have banned vaccine and mask mandates in the name of personal choice, but some have suggested that local officials, not state leaders, should make these decisions.

&#34;The local officials should have control here,&#34; Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., 
told CNN
 in August. &#34;I&#39;m a conservative. I think you govern best when you govern closest to the people being governed. And if a local community is having their ICU is full and the people at the local schools see that they&#39;ve got to make sure they stay open because otherwise children miss out for another year of school … then the local officials should be listened to. That is a conservative principle.&#34;

      Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.

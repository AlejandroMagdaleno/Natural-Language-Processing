MediaBuzz host Howard Kurtz on the possibility of Trump announcing a second run for the White House.
EXCLUSIVE: 
Former President 
Trump
, teasing his plans for 2024, told Fox News that the country is &#34;getting to a point where we really have no choice&#34; but for him to 
run for president
 again. 
In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, the former president was asked about his plans for a potential White House bid in 2024. 
TRUMP SLAMS &#39;RUSHED&#39; AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL, BLAMES &#39;INCOMPETENT&#39; BIDEN
&#34;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to have a choice,&#34; Trump told Fox News. &#34;It is disgraceful.&#34; 
Trump went on to bill the 
Biden
 administration’s withdrawal of U.S. military assets from Afghanistan as the &#34;greatest embarrassment in the history of our country.&#34;
&#34;When you look at Afghanistan and what happened, and the death for no reason, just for no reason,&#34; Trump said, adding that military &#34;parents – they want to speak with me – they don’t want to speak with Biden.&#34; 
&#34;They&#39;re just devastated,&#34; he said. 
&#34;It is getting to a point where we really have no choice,&#34; he added. 
Trump went on to slam President Biden as &#34;an incompetent person as the leader of our country&#34; and called his administration &#34;divisive.&#34; 
&#34;They keep telling everyone how they want to get together, to be inclusive – they&#39;re not inclusive,&#34; Trump said. &#34;They are very, very dividing and divisive.&#34;

&#39;Media Buzz&#39; host Howard Kurtz has reaction on &#39;Special Report&#39; 
Progressive &#34;
Squad
&#34; leader Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y., said in an interview that bipartisan deals &#34;tend to underserve&#34; already underserved communities and prioritize &#34;corporate interests.&#34;
Ocasio-Cortez appeared alongside her fellow House colleague Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., in a Thursday interview in which she was asked about her concerns about a potential bipartisan infrastructure deal with a smaller price tag than what has been proposed by her party and 
President Biden
.
The New York congresswoman responded that bipartisan deals don’t fully serve communities that are already being underserved and that the deals serve corporate interests.
&#34;Usually, I have to say representing the Bronx and Queens, when these bipartisan deals come together, they tend to underserve the communities that are already underserved,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez said in the 
interview
. &#34;Places like the south Bronx, Baltimore, areas of Chicago, across the country.&#34;
BIPARTISAN GROUP OF 21 SENATORS BACK INFRASTRUCTURE DEAL WITH $580B IN NEW SPENDING
&#34;Not only do those communities get left behind and cut out in these bipartisan deals, but corporate interests get centered in these deals, as well,&#34; she continued.
Ocasio-Cortez said that Democrats should prioritize &#34;passing the deal that helps working people the most,&#34; creates jobs, betters infrastructure, reduces climate emissions and raises wages.
&#34;If a bipartisan deal sucks up trillions of dollars in bridges to nowhere because it makes people feel good, then that’s going to be a huge concern,&#34; the congresswoman said. &#34;We need to make sure we are creating economic opportunities for people who are ignored in this country.&#34;
Neither Ocasio-Cortez’s nor Moulton’s offices immediately responded to Fox News’ requests for comment.

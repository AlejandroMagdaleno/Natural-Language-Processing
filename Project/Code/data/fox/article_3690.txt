Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane discusses security precautions for the event on ‘America’s Newsroom.’
FBI Director
 Christopher Wray has named longtime law enforcement official Paul M. Abbate to serve as his top aide as he continues his role as direct under President 
Biden’s administration
, the agency announced on Monday.
Abbate will serve as the FBI’s deputy director and will oversee &#34;FBI domestic and international investigative and intelligence activities,&#34; the agency said in a 
press release
. He replaced former deputy director David Bowdich, who retired ahead of Biden’s inauguration last month.
A longtime FBI official, Abbate became an associate deputy director in 2018. Prior to that role, he held a top leadership position in the FBI’s Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch and within its field offices in Washington, D.C. and Detroit.
In 2017, Abbate was on the 
shortlist
 of officials considered for the role of FBI director. Former President Donald Trump eventually tapped Wray for the post, though their relationship deteriorated in the final months of his term.

House Judiciary Committee member Jim Jordan joins California Republican to discuss Democrat hypocrisy on &#39;Hannity&#39;
California
 Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., believes that 
Republicans
 might face pressure to impeach President 
Biden
 should the party gain control of the 
House
 in the 
2022 midterms
. 
The aftermath of the Jan. 6 
U.S. Capitol riot
 saw former President 
Donald Trump
 removed 
from social media platforms
 and the 
shutdown of Parler
 — a platform popular with Trump supporters. 
If some social media platforms return, it could allow the Republicans to get out &#34;good information&#34; to voters and help the party reclaim the House, the consequences of which could be significant, Nunes told Sean Hannity on Wednesday night.

&#34;If we start to get good information out to the American people, Republicans have a good chance of taking the House in 2022,&#34; Nunes said on &#34;Hannity.&#34; 
&#34;Now, if that happens, and let’s — for example, we don’t know what’s going to happen to Hunter Biden’s laptop. We don’t know what’s going to happen with the Durham investigation. But I could see pressure would become great for us to actually have to impeach Biden,&#34; Nunes added. 
Nunes stressed that he wouldn’t want to impeach the current president, but that &#34;you’re going to have people that are going to say that.&#34;  The congressman did not specify what charges the president may face.
THE FIVE BIGGEST MOMENTS FROM WEDNESDAY&#39;S SESSION OF TRUMP&#39;S IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
Republicans will enter the 2022 midterms with a slim minority, needing to overturn just seven seats — a possibly small task considering the number of seats the party flipped in 2020. 
House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., 
said the party had made &#34;great gains&#34;
 when it flipped 12 seats in November. Polling had projected Democrats to build on their majority in 2020, but 
that was not how things panned out
.
The strong 2020 showing has positioned Republicans to make similar gains in the 2022 midterms, 
according to polling site FiveThirtyEight
: historically, the current presidential party has lost an average of 27 house seats in midterm elections, the site reported.

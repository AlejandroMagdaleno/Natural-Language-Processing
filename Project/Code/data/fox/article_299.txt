The week&#39;s best and worst from Kim Strassel, Holman Jenkins Jr., and Dan Henninger
Videos of a violent clash involving warring radical left and right-wing factions in Olympia, 
Washington
 emerged on social media Saturday and initial reports indicated one person had been shot during the mayhem.
The videos purportedly show Tusitala &#34;Tiny&#34; Toese, a member of the right-wing group the Proud Boys, being shot in the leg during a skirmish that happened as a result of dueling protests. Fox News has not independently verified the identity of the victim. Olympia Police did not respond in time for publication.

&#34;Tiny got shot in the leg,&#34; a man can be heard yelling in one of the videos.

It was unclear how the altercation started or what provoked the gunfire.
Antifa
, a far-left organization, had called for a demonstration at the Washington state Capitol that was ultimately intended as a confrontation against the right wing Proud Boys. 
One Twitter user, 
Alissa
 Azar, says she was chased by a large group of Proud Boys at one point during the melee.
&#34;Hiding in a bar in Olympia,&#34; Azar tweeted. &#34;I turned a corner to 50+ proud boys who said there’s Alissa and ran on me completely alone. I ran as fast as I could. They caught me and pulled my hair and shoved me to the ground then bear maced me. People af the bad pull me in hiding here now.&#34;

Police responded to the shooting and could be seen in videos cordoning off the area but it is unclear if any arrests were made or if a suspect was identified.

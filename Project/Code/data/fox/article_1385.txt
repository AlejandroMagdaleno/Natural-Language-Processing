President offers words of admiration for the Michigan Democrat during speech at Ford plant
President Biden
 and Democratic Rep. 
Rashida Tlaib
 engaged in a tense, roughly eight-minute conversation on the airport tarmac in Detroit after Biden&#39;s arrival there Tuesday.
Tlaib refused to say what she and the president discussed. At one point, Biden patted the congresswoman’s shoulder. Later, during a speech in Dearborn, he lavishly complimented her.

&#34;I want to say to you that I admire your intellect, I admire your passion, and I admire your concern for so many other people. And it&#39;s from my heart,&#34; Biden said later of Tlaib during his speech at the Dearborn Ford factory. &#34;I pray that your Grandma and family are well, I promise to do everything you see that they are in the West Bank.&#34;
&#34;You&#39;re a fighter,&#34; he added, though he mistakenly referred to her as Rasheed. &#34;And God, thank you for being a fighter.&#34;
Tlaib has been fiercely critical of Biden and the State Department’s handling of the recent conflict between Hamas and Israel.
&#34;If you support a cease-fire, then get out of the way of the U.N. Security Council and join other countries in demanding it,&#34; she said in a tweet directed at the president and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
&#34;Apartheid-in-chief Netanyahu will not listen to anyone asking nicely,&#34; she continued. &#34;He commits war crimes and openly violates international law.&#34;
Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, has called on the U.S. to recall funding for Israel, alleging the weapons provided are used to &#34;kill children and families.&#34; 
&#34;Enough, President Biden,&#34; Tlaib said in a Monday interview with MSNBC. &#34;You will not do this on our watch. You have to speak out against this violence in a very aggressive way that holds Netanyahu and his leadership accountable.&#34;

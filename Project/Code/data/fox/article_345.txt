New York Democrat 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 condemned the Biden administration’s decision to temporarily reopen a Texas 
migrant
 facility this week, launching a fundraising campaign Friday to ask constituents to fight for immigration reform.
&#34;This is not okay, never has been okay, never will be okay – no matter the administration or party,&#34; Ocasio Cortez said in a statement emailed to her supporters Friday.
The New York Democrat -- who notoriously exchanged blows with former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 
Thomas Homan
 during a 2019 House Oversight Committee hearing -- has backed an immigration reform bill put forward by Rep. Pramila Jayapal late last month.
AOC TEARS INTO BIDEN ADMIN FOR REOPENING CHILD MIGRANT FACILITY: &#39;THIS IS NOT OKAY&#39;
The 
Roadmap to Freedom Resolution
 calls for an end to migrant family detention centers and provides a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants.
The resolution proposes using community-based alternatives to detention centers while migrants await court hearings – similar to processes used by border control for migrants who are seeking asylum.
&#34;It’s only 2 [months] into this admin and our fraught, unjust immigration system will not transform in that time. That’s why bold reimagination is so [important],&#34; Ocasio Cortez tweeted earlier this week.
&#34;DHS shouldn’t exist, agencies should be reorganized, ICE gotta go, ban for-profit detention, create climate refugee status and more,&#34; she added, echoing a portion of the resolution that calls for &#34;demilitarizing the border.&#34;
Ocasio Cortez claimed the U.S. immigration system has been &#34;broken for decades&#34; and noted that it needed repairing long before the Trump administration.
She has asked her supporters to chip in $3 to help fund &#34;resources to organize and win&#34; progressive immigration reform.
The Texas detention facility had been open under the Trump administration from roughly a month but is being reestablished as a holding center for up to 700 children, ages 13-17, noted the 
Department of Health and Human Services
. 
The White House has said the facility is being reopened to allow for additional housing space so that individuals can be properly distanced during the coronavirus pandemic.

&#34;To ensure the health and safety of these kids, [the Department of Health and Human Services] took steps to open an emergency facility to add capacity where these kids can be provided the care they need before they are safely placed with families and sponsors,&#34; White House press secretary 
Jen Psaki
 told reporters Tuesday. 
&#34;So it’s a temporary reopening during COVID-19, our intention is very much to close it, but we want to make sure we can follow COVID protocols,&#34; she added.

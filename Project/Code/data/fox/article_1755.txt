Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey tells ‘Fox and Friends’ President Biden’s border crisis heavily impacts the U.S. economy and communities. 
The border crisis needs to be &#34;stopped&#34; as the migrant surge increase affects residents, Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
&#34; on Thursday, blasting 
President Biden’
s policies for heavily impacting the U.S. economy and communities.
IVEY:
 &#34;The first thing is everybody needs to accept that this is a crisis. Quite frankly, if it&#39;s not a crisis, why did we send FEMA? Because we only send them out to disasters. So, this is a crisis and it has the ability to filter into every community. 
...
In fact, it does filter into every community. It&#39;s impacting us with detainers being taken off of violent criminals. It&#39;s impacting us with our abilities to fight Covid-19. It&#39;s impacting us with massive shipments of drugs coming into our country, human trafficking of children. The list goes on and on. So, it&#39;s impacting everybody in this country.
BIDEN WRONG NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE BORDER &#39;CRISIS,&#39; ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS TELL FOX NEWS
...
&#34;So it&#39;s impacting us financially and our economy. It&#39;s draining all the resources from Customs and Border Patrol. And, to me, the biggest issue is the amount of illegal drugs that are coming across as a part of this.
And, you know, when you look at fentanyl; we seized enough fentanyl in our community that if it was put in a lethal dose, it would have killed all 600,000 citizens in our county. So, you know, it is a crisis and we need to stop it. I&#39;m very proud of our attorney general, Ashleigh Moody. She&#39;s taking us to task, has filed a lawsuit against the others. I’m glad to see others have joined right now.&#34;

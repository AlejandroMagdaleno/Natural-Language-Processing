President Trump’s 
former chief of staff Mark Meadows accused House impeachment managers of &#34;conveniently&#34; leaving out a line from Trump’s pre-Capitol riot speech, where he told supporters to &#34;peacefully and patriotically&#34; make their voices heard. 
&#34;There’s one line from President Trump’s January 6th speech that Democrats keep conveniently leaving out,&#34; Meadows wrote on Twitter. &#34;Peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.&#34;
Hours after Meadows made the remark, Rep. Madeline Dean, D-Pa. noted Trump&#39;s &#34;peacefully and patriotically&#34; comment. &#34;In a speech spanning almost 11,000 words — yes, we did check — that was the one time, the only time, President Trump used the word peaceful or any suggestion of non-violence.&#34;
Democrats on day one of the Trump impeachment trial played a graphic clip of Trump rioters beating and berating police officers and forcing their way into the Capitol. They broke up the clip with snippets of Trump’s speech at the &#34;Save America&#34; rally, including lines where he told supporters to &#34;fight like hell&#34; against election results. 
DEMS IN TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PULL UP GRAPHIC VIDEO OF CAPITOL ATTACK 
House impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said Wednesday the evidence will show Trump is &#34;no innocent bystander&#34; and described him as the &#34;inciter in chief.&#34; He accused him of abdicating his responsibility and oath of office.
Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Calif., also used Trump&#39;s words against him, specifically his call to &#34;stop the steal.&#34; He said it was a &#34;call to arms&#34; and not &#34;rhetorical.&#34;

During that Jan. 6 speech, Trump doubled down on his false claims about the election and said, &#34;If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.&#34; Trump did tell his followers to march &#34;peacefully and patriotically&#34; to the Capitol, but those who favor his impeachment and conviction say the balance of his post-election behavior and his comments at the rally made clear the president was the cause of the violence at the Capitol. Trump&#39;s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, called for &#34;trial by combat&#34; on the very same stage that morning.

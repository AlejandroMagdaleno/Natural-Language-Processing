House Majority Whip tells &#39;Your World&#39; the president&#39;s behavior has been worse than any other chief executive
House Majority Whip James Clyburn
, D-S.C., told Fox News Wednesday that 
President Trump
 should be legally prevented from holding elected office again as the House impeached him for an unprecedented second time. 
Clyburn told &#34;
Your World
&#34; that Trump did &#34;the worst thing any president of these United States has ever done&#34; when he held a rally on the Ellipse that precipitated last weeks riot at the U.S. Capitol.
&#34;We&#39;re doing our jobs in the House of Representatives,&#34; he told host Neil Cavuto. &#34;It&#39;s our job to impeach. Once the impeachment is done, it&#39;s up to the Senate to decide whether or not to convict.&#34;
Clyburn then recalled that  Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., &#34;said in his closing remarks at the first impeachment that [Trump] won&#39;t be stopped. He will continue to do what he&#39;s been doing all of his life. 
&#34;And here we are, back to another impeachment because he continued to do what he&#39;s always done.&#34;
Clyburn dismissed the notion that holding an impeachment trial of Trump after he leaves office is akin to &#34;going after&#34; a private citizen, saying: &#34;The impeachment still stands. The Senate can take it up whenever they want to.&#34;
The Majority Whip also suggested that Trump&#39;s conduct bars him from holding office under Section III of the 14th Amendment, which prevents anyone from running for office who has led an &#34;insurrection or rebellion&#34; or given quarter to &#34;enemies&#34; of the state.

&#34;Quite frankly he should be convicted and forever barred from holding any office of honor in this country for the rest of his life,&#34; Clyburn insisted.
&#34;It&#39;s interesting that we&#39;re dealing with it [the 14th Amendment] here after a group of people descended upon this Capitol fanning the flames of racism. That is what was going on last Wednesday and that&#39;s what&#39;s been going on with this president for a long time,&#34; he added. &#34;It would be good to use the 14th amendment to bar him from office.&#34;

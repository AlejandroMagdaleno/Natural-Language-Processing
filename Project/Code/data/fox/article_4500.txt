Missouri Senator Josh Hawley joins &#39;America&#39;s Newsroom&#39; to discuss his plan to keep Americans safe
Sen. 
Josh Hawley
, R-Mo., on Wednesday introduced legislation to hire 100,000 new 
police officers
 across the U.S. and boost optimism among police and communities.
The bill would provide federal grants to locales to boost new police hires; increase penalties for assaulting federal officers by 50%; develop programs to protect the private information judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officials; extend concealed carry rights to federal judges and prosecutors; increase service programs for federal officers; and more.
&#34;It&#39;s absolutely vital that we keep American families safe. That is the bottom line, and right now, too many Americans aren&#39;t. Why aren&#39;t they? Because … violent 
crime
 is up by over 
30%
 in cities across the country,&#34; Hawley said Wednesday on &#34;
America&#39;s Newsroom
&#34; &#34;Unfortunately, that includes my home state of Missouri. We need more cops. We shouldn&#39;t be defunding the police. We should be supporting them.&#34;

The legislation comes amid reports of 
low police morale
 and 
difficulty hiring
 and 
retaining
 officers as the country continues to face a cultural reckoning more than a year after George Floyd&#39;s murder, with federal and local politicians alike working to reallocate funds from police departments and focus on community-centric responses to crime.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROFESSOR SAYS CALLS TO DEFUND THE POLICE ‘EMBOLDENED CRIMINALS’
Meanwhile, cities are facing large 
increases in violent crime
 rates, and some police departments are 
asking for help
.
&#34;This is not the time to defund the police or vilify them, but to support the brave men and women in blue — and put more of them on the streets. Immediately,&#34; Hawley said in a Thursday statement.
Calls from 
progressive
 federal, state and local lawmakers to &#34;defund&#34; police departments or reduce state and citywide police budgets became popularized after Floyd&#39;s murder. Demonstrators, pundits and progressive politicians repeated the phrase last year while more 
moderate
 Democrats 
pushed back
 against the idea.

Minneapolis, which was once 
ground zero
 for the &#34;defund the police&#34; movement in the wake of Floyd’s death, 
backtracked
 on its original push to defund the police department in February after residents begged the city to hire more officers, citing longer response times and increased violent crime. 
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio cut the New York Police Department&#39;s budget by 
$1 billion
; Los Angeles approved a 
$150 million
 police budget cut; Philadelphia approved a 
$33 million
 police budget cut in June; Portland, Oregon, cut 
$16 million
 from its police budget; and several other cities have approved 
similar reductions

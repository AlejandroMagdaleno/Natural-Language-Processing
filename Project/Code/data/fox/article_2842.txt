FOX News correspondent Bryan Llenas joins &#39;Special Report&#39; with the latest on the new allegation
New York Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
&#39;s own responses to sexual harassment allegations show that even if — as he claims — he did not intend to offend or harass anyone, he failed to alter his behavior even after the rise of the #MeToo movement.
After 
Charlotte Bennett
 accused him of making inappropriate comments to her on multiple occasions including asking about her sex life and telling her he was looking for a girlfriend, Cuomo did not deny the alleged behavior but claimed he did not mean anything by it. Following Anna Ruch&#39;s accusation that Cuomo grabbed her face and kissed her on the cheek without consent at a wedding, Cuomo said that was standard behavior for him.
SIXTH CUOMO ACCUSER SAYS GOVERNOR TOUCHED HER IN THE EXECUTIVE MANSION: REPORT
&#34;You can go find hundreds of pictures of me kissing people. Men, women, it is my usual and customary way of greeting,&#34; Cuomo said at a press briefing last week.
That statement was an explanation for the alleged incident with Ruch in 2020, roughly three years after the #MeToo movement took hold following allegations against Harvey Weinstein in 2017. Bennett&#39;s claims were based on allegations from 2019. A new report by the Albany 
Times Union
 features allegations from a sixth accuser, a member of Cuomo&#39;s executive chamber staff, who claimed that Cuomo touched her inappropriately at the governor&#39;s mansion in late 2020.

FAMILIES OF NY NURSING HOME VICTIMS DEMAND CUOMO FORFEIT MONEY FROM BOOK DEAL: &#39;BASED ON A LIE&#39;
At last week&#39;s briefing Cuomo apologized for the behavior that led to Bennett&#39;s allegations, saying that he &#34;never knew at the time I was making anyone feel uncomfortable.&#34;
New York employment lawyer Misty Marris called Cuomo&#39;s excuse &#34;absolutely absurd&#34; from a legal standpoint.
&#34;In a private sector job, he would have been terminated,&#34; said Marris, who conducts harassment training sessions required under New York law.
&#34;Asking anyone about their personal sex life is black-and-white, clear-as-day violative of the law regardless of intent,&#34; Marris told Fox News. &#34;The standard is whether a reasonable person would find the conduct offensive.&#34;
Marris called it ironic that it was Cuomo who signed laws in 2018 and 2019 that &#34;significantly strengthen&#34; protections for workers. These protections include &#34;requiring training for sexual harassment which explicitly prohibits the exact conduct he has admittedly engaged in,&#34; she said.

Since the allegations against Cuomo came pouring in — adding pressure on top of the scandal surrounding nursing home deaths — several members of Cuomo&#39;s administration have announced their departures.
Most recently, Counsel to the Governor Kumiki Gibson announced she is leaving. Gibson&#39;s name is now on a list including press secretary Caitlin Girouard, interim policy adviser Erin Hammond, and COVID-19 Response Task Force aide Gareth Rhodes.

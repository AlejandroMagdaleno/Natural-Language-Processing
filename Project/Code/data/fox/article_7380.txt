White House press secretary 
Jen Psaki
 was questioned Wednesday over comments she made alleging Republicans want to &#34;
defund the police
,&#34; but she was unable to name a single GOP member who supported the controversial line.
Despite the rallying cry to &#34;defund the police&#34; used by Democrats like Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri, and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Psaki suggested that in not voting for the American Rescue plan – which included a provision for law enforcement  – Republicans were the true opponents of police funding. 
PSAKI CASTS GOP AS PARTY OF &#39;DEFUND THE POLICE&#39; AFTER SLOGAN BACKFIRES ON DEMOCRATS
&#34;The president ran and won the most votes of any candidate in history on a platform of boosting funding for law enforcement after Republicans spent decades trying to cut the COPS program,&#34; Psaki told Fox News Wednesday. &#34;There&#39;s a record of that, that doesn&#39;t require anyone having new comments.&#34;
The COPS Hiring Program is an initiative funding law enforcement hiring.
Psaki added that Republicans &#34;stood in the way of crucial funding needed to prevent the laying off of police officers as crimes increased.&#34;
The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan included a $350 billion measure for state and local governments that could be used for police, but Republicans rejected the plan as a &#34;socialist&#34; solution to pandemic relief. 
But when pressed on which Republicans in Congress rejected the bill on the grounds of seeking to &#34;defund the police,&#34; Psaki was drawn up short.

&#34;I think actions speak louder than words,&#34; she said. &#34;If you oppose funding for the COPS program -- something that was dramatically cut by the prior administration and many Republicans supported -- and then you vote against a bill that has funding for the COPS program, we can let other people evaluate what that means. 
&#34;It doesn&#39;t require them to speak to it or to shout it out,&#34; she added.

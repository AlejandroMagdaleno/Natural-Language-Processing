Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, provides insight into the GOP’S 2022 strategy on ‘Sunday Morning Futures.’
President Biden’s
 &#34;radical&#34; 
foreign policy
 agenda is &#34;turning upside down our Middle East policy&#34; and giving 
Iran
 an &#34;out&#34; to become a nuclear state with a return to the Obama-era nuclear deal, Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, said Sunday.
Turner told 
&#34;Sunday Morning Futures&#34;
 host Maria Bartiromo that the 2015 Iran nuclear deal was &#34;terminally flawed,&#34; having an expiration to key provisions relating to Iran&#39;s nuclear program and allowing for the country to continue missile development.

&#34;By this administration going back to this agreement, they’re really giving Iran the out to be able to pursue becoming a nuclear state,&#34; Turner said.
Turner said that along with Iran, the Biden administration was &#34;turning toward&#34; China, which he described as another U.S. &#34;adversary&#34; that is &#34;our greatest vulnerability for jobs, our greatest vulnerability for our economy.&#34;
&#34;This administration is turning its eye from our allies and to those who are our adversaries,&#34; Turner said.

Turner also discussed security at the U.S. Capitol, where National Guards troops are still on patrol and barbed-wire fencing still wraps around the complex following the Jan. 6 riot.
&#34;By walling off the Capitol, by walling off this symbol of democracy, they’re indicating we are a democracy in peril instead of just getting to work and serving the American public,&#34; he said.
Turner said that there is no threat that justifies these security measures, which he called a part of the Democrat’s &#34;narrative of fear.&#34;

&#34;The American public isn’t our adversary, Iran is our adversary,&#34; Turner said.

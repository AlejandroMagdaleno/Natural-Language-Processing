&#39;Fox &amp; Friends Weekend&#39; co-host Pete Hegseth, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran, argues the &#39;utter failure&#39; of the Defense Department and intelligence agencies &#39;to understand the nature of the enemy&#39; is &#39;demoralizing.&#39; 
EXCLUSIVE 
– House Homeland Security Committee ranking member Rep. John Katko warned that Afghanistan could become the &#34;world headquarters of terrorism,&#34; telling Fox News that the withdrawal of U.S. troops has created the &#34;perfect springboard&#34; for radical extremists to reconstitute, posing a grave threat to U.S. national security.
During an exclusive interview with Fox News, Katko, R-N.Y., the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, said the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan brings the U.S. back to &#34;a pre-9/11 footing,&#34; which he warned &#34;makes a perfect environment for foreign fighters and terrorists to establish a foothold.&#34;

&#34;That, in and of itself, puts us on a less safe footing here in the United States,&#34; Katko said. &#34;Groups like Al Qaeda now have the opportunity to grow again and metastasize.&#34;
&#34;What we did not have pre-9/11, though, that we have now, is an absolutely porous southern border,&#34; Katko warned. &#34;This is the beginning of what could be a very bad thing. You only need one or two to create mayhem here, which could happen because of our porous southern border.&#34;

Katko, pointing to data reported by former Customs and Border Protection officials, said there has been &#34;a significant uptick in known terror across the southern border.&#34;
&#34;And that&#39;s before Afghanistan fell,&#34; Katko said. &#34;This is a very dangerous situation, and what is most disturbing is that the president was just defiant as hell about his decision – it is clear he didn&#39;t listen to his key military advisers – and he did not talk about the biggest implication of his decision, which is an increased threat to the homeland.&#34;
Katko, referencing President Biden&#39;s Monday address to the nation, in which he said he stands &#34;squarely behind&#34; his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, said &#34;not many disagree&#34; with his sentiment, adding that &#34;no one wants this war to go on forever.&#34;
&#34;But that is besides the point – the point is he did not address at all what this means to us going forward about the security of our homeland,&#34; Katko said, calling the president&#39;s speech and strategy a &#34;colossal failure.&#34;

Biden, during his speech, said he is &#34;adamant we focus on the threats we face today in 2021, not yesterday&#39;s threats,&#34; saying that the terrorist threat has &#34;metastasized well beyond Afghanistan.&#34;
&#34;His so-called &#39;threat of yesterday&#39; has now become the threat of today,&#34; Katko told Fox News. &#34;Basically, he is creating the world headquarters of terrorism.&#34;
He added: &#34;The threat, when you are allowing the world headquarters to be created for one of your threats of the past, it becomes a current threat. No doubt about it.&#34;
Biden, on Monday, admitted that the fall of the country to the Taliban &#34;did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated.&#34; 
Biden placed blame on the Afghan leadership for the country&#39;s plight, saying that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani had refused advice to negotiate and erroneously insisted Afghan forces would fight.

&#34;American troops cannot, and should not, be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves,&#34; Biden said Monday, adding that the U.S. has given &#34;every tool they could need.&#34; 
&#34;We gave them the chance to determine their own future,&#34; he said. &#34;What we could not provide them was the will to fight for that future.&#34; 
Looking ahead, Katko said the U.S. needs to &#34;re-double our efforts as best we can,&#34; and do &#34;as much intel gathering as we can,&#34; which he said &#34;would be difficult without boots on the ground.&#34;
When asked whether he believed Biden could reverse course, and re-create a U.S. presence in Afghanistan amid Taliban rule, Katko said: &#34;To get that back will cost a tremendous amount of blood and treasure.&#34;

&#34;It is ironic that the president has created this, because this is the thing he was trying to prevent,&#34; Katko said.
Meanwhile, Katko said he was concerned about China and Russia&#39;s presence in Afghanistan.
&#34;China and Russia love nothing more than to see mayhem created in the United States, but they&#39;re not stupid enough to create it themselves,&#34; Katko said. &#34;If they cozy up to the Taliban government, like it sounds like they&#39;re going to, that is the perfect proxy to help fund and foment mayhem in the U.S. without having to have their fingers on it.&#34;

A 
Democratic
 congresswoman appeared to flip the bird at a female National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) staffer while ignoring her question on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., was approached by a female NRCC staffer who was filming her while asking a question about the speaker.
In the video, Murphy ignores the question while walking past the staffer, appearing to give her a one-finger salute while pretending to scratch her head.

Fox News reached out to Murphy&#39;s office about her apparent middle-finger gesture to the staffer but received no response.
NRCC communications director Michael McAdams slammed the House Democrat for the obscene gesture in a Friday statement to Fox News.
&#34;House Democrats can’t handle being held accountable for their radical actions so they’re resorting to making obscene gestures at young female staffers,&#34; McAdams said.
Murphy wasn&#39;t the only House Democrat to get frustrated with a tracker this week. 
Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-Conn., on Thursday published a video online of a confrontation she had with someone she claimed was a political tracker.

Hayes interrupted the tracker’s question about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., saying: &#34;This is a tracker. Their only job is to stand outside of my office and to catch me.&#34;
&#34;We’re just trying to hold you accountable, congresswoman,&#34; the person said.

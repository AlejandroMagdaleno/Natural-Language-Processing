Caitlyn Jenner
 announced Sunday that she will &#34;decide soon&#34; whether she will throw her hat in the ring to unseat California Gov. Gavin Newsom.
The Olympian and 
reality TV star
 addressed speculation of a potential campaign run on Twitter over the weekend after Axios reported that she was coordinating with longtime GOP fundraiser Caroline Wren, who had ties to former President Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign.
On Sunday however, Jenner denied a tweet suggesting she was seriously considering a run in the Golden State, where an effort to recall Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
 is well underway.
FORMER PORN STAR RUNNING FOR CALIFORNIA GOVORNOR AS NEWSOM FACES RECALL
&#34;#FakeNews show me the contracts,&#34; she wrote.
Jenner said California doesn&#39;t &#34;want a 
#lgbt
 fiscal conservative and socially liberal candidate running.&#34;
But, she continued, &#34;I am with Californians and will decide soon. I have been here for 45+ years and love CA.&#34;
Jenner, 71, has reportedly considered running for public office before.
Rumors of Jenner’s political ambitions resurfaced after Gov. Newsom&#39;s recall effort reached more than 2.1 million signatures in March despite only needing 1.5 million for a recall vote on this year&#39;s ballot.
Several other candidates have already announced their candidacy to unseat the Democrat governor. Businessman John Cox, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, former Congressman Doug Ose and porn star Mary Carey are all reportedly eyeing a run in the recall campaign.
California has a low bar to enter a recall election. A candidate must pay about $4,000, which could attract serious candidates and others possibly seeking fame, reports said.

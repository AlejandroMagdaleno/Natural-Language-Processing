Senate Judiciary Committee member explains why he refuses to &#39;bow down&#39; to the radical mob on &#39;FOX News Primetime&#39;
Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told Fox News Tuesday that he will not seek the Republican nomination for president in 2024. 
&#34;I&#39;ve always said, Maria, that I&#39;m not running for president,&#34; Hawley told &#34;Fox News Primetime&#34; host Maria Bartiromo. &#34;It&#39;s a privilege to represent the state of Missouri in the United States Senate.

HAWLEY RIPS SENATE DEMOCRATS FOR ETHICS COMPLAINT, SAYS THEY&#39;RE &#39;TRYING TO SILENCE DISSENT&#39;
Hawley has called for the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate the seven Democrats who filed the complaint against him and Cruz for filing &#34;an unprecedently frivolous and improper ethics complaint ... without citing any relevant evidence or offering any good-faith argument.&#34;

Publisher Simon &amp; Schuster then canceled Hawley’s book deal following the riot. The Republican fired back on Twitter, writing: &#34;This could not be more Orwellian Simon &amp; Schuster is canceling my contract because I was representing my constituents, leading a debate on the Senate floor on voter integrity, which they have now decided to redefine as sedition.&#34;

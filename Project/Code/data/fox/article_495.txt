Iowa Republican joins &#39;Fox Report&#39; to discuss her recent trip to southern border amid a massive influx of migrants
EXCLUSIVE
: Rep. 
Ashley Hinson
, R-Iowa, introduced new legislation Tuesday to make permanent five of former 
President Donald Trump
&#39;s executive orders that 
President Biden
 already repealed. 
The freshman lawmaker authored the &#34;Red Tape Reduction Act&#34; to restore Trump&#39;s deregulatory actions that Hinson said were instrumental in helping small businesses and the economy grow. 
&#34;President Trump worked to unravel the regulatory web in Washington and pull back the heavy hand of government that hurts small businesses, farmers and workers,&#34; Hinson said in a statement to Fox News. &#34;Coupled with tax cuts, this unleashed the strongest economy in modern history.&#34;
ASHLEY HINSON, FORMER TV NEWS ANCHOR, IS LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS — NOT TO &#39;LAUNCH FIREBOMBS&#39; IN CONGRESS
The most notable of Trump&#39;s executive orders Hinson wants to make permanent is 
Executive Order 13771
, which required the federal government to eliminate two regulations for each new one an agency enacts. The executive actions also required agencies to designate an official to implement regulatory reform and to require the federal government to act fairly and transparently when putting new regulations in place.

      Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, serves on the House Appropriations Committee.

&#34;Unfortunately, the Biden administration has rescinded many successful deregulatory policies and is embracing a big government mindset that will pull down our economy when we most need growth and hurt rural communities in Iowa,&#34; Hinson said. &#34;That&#39;s why I introduced legislation to save President Trump&#39;s deregulatory agenda and make his pro-growth policies permanent.&#34;

Hinson, a former TV news anchor who flipped a blue seat in Iowa this fall, ran on kitchen table issues such as being a good steward of taxpayer dollars and improving the climate for small businesses. Her new legislation has long odds of passing with Democrats controlling both chambers in Congress and the White House.

Bill McGurn and Leo Terrell react on &#39;The Story&#39;
Randi 
Weingarten
, president of the largest U.S. teachers&#39; union, on Thursday walked back her claim that &#34;millions&#34; of people would die under 
Florida
 Gov. 
Ron 
DeSantis
&#39; leadership.
Weingarten said in a 
Wednesday tweet
 that &#34;millions of Floridians are going to die for Ron DeSantis&#39; ignorance&#34; in response to an article from The Washington Post pointing out anti-Dr. Anthony Fauci merchandise on the Republican governor&#39;s official website.
LIBERALS FUMING AFTER DESANTIS WEBSITE SELLS BEER KOOZIES SAYING ‘DON’T FAUCI MY FLORIDA&#39;
After receiving some criticism for her hyperbole, the American Federation of Teachers president backtracked the claim on Thursday.
&#34;You are all probably right… I shouldn’t have said millions,&#34; Weingarten tweeted. &#34;I should have just said DeSantis was wrong to do this.. Fauci is an amazing public servant. He shoudn’t be mocked. But I shouldn’t engage in that kind of hyperbole either. My bad…&#34;
Christina Pushaw, DeSantis&#39; press secretary, had shot back at Weingarten&#39;s claim, touting the governor&#39;s record during the pandemic.
&#34;Florida’s COVID death rate is lower than the national average, and unlike the Governor of New York, we don’t fudge the numbers,&#34; Pushaw wrote in a 
tweet
. &#34;Meanwhile, Randi Weingarten ruined the education of millions of kids by keeping them out of school for more than a year based on a conspiracy theory.&#34;

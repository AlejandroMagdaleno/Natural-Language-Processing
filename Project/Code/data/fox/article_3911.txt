Bestselling author thinker tells &#39;Tucker Carlson Today&#39; that oppression has replaced heroism and bravery as qualities.
Bestselling author Douglas Murray joined Tucker Carlson for the inaugural episode of &#34;
Tucker Carlson Today
,&#34; which premiered Monday on 
Fox Nation
.
The theme of the first episode is &#34;Oppression and the Passport to Elite Success.&#34; During the program, Murray explained how, in recent times, American culture has inverted what qualities make someone a leader or a figure to be respected.
FOX NATION DIGS INTO &#39;THE CURSE OF TIPPECANOE&#39; AS PART OF LOOK BACK AT REAGAN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
&#34;Many of us grew up in societies where we admired people who were brave or heroic who strove to show people the way to be brave in their lives,&#34; he said. &#34;Now if you want to be a leader, you need to show that you are an oppressed minority; you have to show suffering, you have to show beleguerment; that everything has been done against you.&#34;
&#34;People are meant not to admire heroism, but admire suffering -- we&#39;ve created a suffering Olympics, where very privileged people wish [for] people not to recognize their privilege, but recognize them as being downtrodden: This is just this era&#39;s passport to elite success.&#34;
In turn, Murray suggested people who understand true qualities of leadership and productive culture could &#34;point out that this is nonsense.&#34;
&#34;[Say] I dont recognize your right to claim victimhood, you claim not to be a victim.&#34;
One way, he said, would be for an individual criticized for being privileged to, in turn, point out they are in some way part of another &#34;oppressed group.&#34;

&#34;The point is to show you&#39;re the most oppressed person so you win, and you can tell everyone else what to do,&#34; he said, calling the new woke culture an &#34;irreducible game.&#34;
&#34;You either speak the truth as you see it or you grow to despise yourself.&#34;
&#34;Who’s doing the judging here exactly? You have to work out the difference between people who are critics and an enemy: A real critic wants you to improve, an enemy wants you gone. And you in America have seem to have lost the ability to differentiate between these two things,&#34; the U.K. native said.

A segment of 
Democrats
 have been pushing for President Biden to have the ability to expand the roster of the 
Supreme Court
 and pack it with liberal justices, but Thursday&#39;s 9-0 ruling in favor of a religious foster care agency that would not work with LGBT couples is leaving some on the left disappointed with the entire court.
The court&#39;s 6-3 majority of Republican-appointed justices that came to be after former President Trump got to appoint three within four years has led left-wing political figures and activists to promote court packing as a way to negate a perceived conservative advantage. Thursday&#39;s decision in Fulton v. Philadelphia showed that even the liberal wing of the court can side with conservatives on hot-button issues.
SUPREME COURT SIDES WITH CATHOLIC FOSTER AGENCY THAT EXCLUDES SAME-SEX COUPLES IN 9-0 RULING
&#34;Can anyone give me any valid reason why Kagan, Breyer, and Sotomayor would rule for the Catholic foster care agency?&#34; one Twitter user questioned. 
&#34;This is what happens when there isn&#39;t one openly LGBTQ+ person in the Supreme Court,&#34; another 
said
, adding, &#34;F--- all the justices, incl. the supposedly liberal ones.&#34;

The reactions to the decision were not limited to average social media users. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., weighed in, calling the decision &#34;such a disappointing ruling.&#34; 
WHITE HOUSE CHEERS SUPREME COURT OBAMACARE DECISION WITH NOD TO BIDEN&#39;S ‘BIG F--- DEAL’ HOT MIC COMMENT
&#34;This case isn&#39;t about religious freedom — it&#39;s about discrimination against LGBTQ+ families who want to give foster children a loving home,&#34; Jayapal said, insisting that Congress must now pass legislation to protect LGBT rights.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tried to put a positive spin on the decision, as the court did not go as far as the plaintiffs had requested. Thursday&#39;s ruling was relatively narrow in that it did not overturn any precedent.

&#34;Today’s unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court made clear: discrimination has no place in our foster and adoption systems, or anywhere in our democracy,&#34; Pelosi said in a statement. &#34;While the decision was not a sweeping victory, Americans are proud that the Court affirmed that LGBTQ couples have a right to welcome children in our foster care system into their families.&#34;

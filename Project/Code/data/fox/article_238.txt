FOX News correspondent Bryan Llenas has the latest details on the controversy on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Trevor Noah railed against Gov. Andrew Cuomo over his administration’s handling of the 
data surrounding COVID-19 in nursing homes
, in a recent episode of &#34;The Daily Show.&#34;
It was recently revealed that the governor&#39;s office may 
have undercounted the number of coronavirus deaths in nursing homes
 by more than 50%, according to a report from New York Attorney General Letitia James. 
And one of the biggest bombshells arose late Thursday when the 
New York Post
 revealed that Cuomo’s top aide, Melissa DeRosa, admitted during a conference call with Democratic leaders that the administration hid unfavorable information about the state’s nursing home COVID-19 deaths out of concern that it &#34;was going to be used against us.&#34;
&#34;Wow, really, Governor Cuomo?&#34; Noah asked during the episode. &#34;You lowered your own numbers to make yourself look better?&#34;

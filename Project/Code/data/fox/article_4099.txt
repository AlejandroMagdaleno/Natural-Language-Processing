Newt Gingrich sounds off on &#39;Life, Liberty &amp;amp; Levin&#39; as Pelosi claims impeachment to be unifying
House
 Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
, D-Calif. is &#34;the most dangerous Speaker of the House we&#39;ve had probably in American history,&#34; former Speaker Newt Gingrich told &#34;
Life, Liberty &amp; Levin
&#34; in an interview airing Sunday.
&#34;She lives in an enclave that is guarded in San Francisco,&#34; Gingrich told host Mark Levin. &#34;She is surrounded by left-wing looney tunes who think that it&#39;s OK to live in a city where ... there&#39;s a map you can go to on the internet that shows you where feces were. They don&#39;t distinguish dog and human, but they&#39;ll show you the feces count that day around San Francisco.&#34;
&#34;This is the same problem with [Vice President] Kamala Harris,&#34; Gingrich added. &#34;They come from the center of left-wing nuttiness, and all their friends at the local country club or all their friends when they go to a cocktail party, think this craziness makes sense.&#34;
Gingrich added that Pelosi, whose father and brother were Democratic mayors of Baltimore, &#34;has been in politics so long that she operates like a genuine machine politician of the old order. And she doesn&#39;t mind abusing power. She doesn&#39;t mind running over people ... she&#39;s so willing to break the rules and to, frankly, just say things that are totally untrue.&#34;

Host Mark Levin told Gingrich that Pelosi showed &#34;gall&#34; when she claimed that the snap impeachment by the House of former President Donald Trump &#34;unites the country.&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s also interesting how the press react to her when she has a press conference,&#34; Levin added. &#34;You dare step out of line and ask her a tough question, she dismisses you, she diminishes you, and they don&#39;t start yelling questions at her.&#34;
&#34;Well, what you have right now with the press corps are left-wing lapdogs,&#34; Gingrich responded. &#34;And their job is to go over and lick the hand of the left-wingers and then try to bite the Republicans. So that&#39;s their duty. I mean, they&#39;re just behaving like they&#39;ve been trained to behave.&#34;

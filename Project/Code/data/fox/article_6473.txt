Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-
N.J.
, is in hot water after failing to publicly disclose at least $671,000 in personal stock trades in 2020.
Malinowski made a flurry of trades in March 2020 at the beginning of the 
coronavirus
 pandemic, investing in General Mills, the J.M. Smucker Company and, later, Peloton, according to 
Business Insider
, which first reported Malinowski&#39;s failure to disclose the trades.

Malinowski &#34;has a financial advisor that makes trading decisions on his behalf without his regular input,&#34; his spokeswoman told Business Insider. Malinowski is willing to pay a fine if the House Ethics Committee deems it appropriate, his spokeswoman told Business Insider.
Malinowski may have made as much as $2.76 million in trades as members of Congress are not required to report exact amounts of their stock assets, according to Business Insider.

Malinowski had given a Business Insider reporter access to information about his stock activity, leading to the revelation that many of the 2020 trades were not listed publicly as required.
&#34;Filing these disclosures late was an oversight that he is taking steps to correct,&#34; Colston Reid, Malinowski&#39;s chief of staff, told Business Insider.

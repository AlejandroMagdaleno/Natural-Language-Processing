Former President Donald Trump&#39;s Make America Great Again PAC severed ties with Corey Lewandowski on Wednesday amid allegations of sexual misconduct against the longtime Trump adviser.
&#34;Pam Bondi, the very talented and honorable frmr AG of FL, has our complete faith and confidence in taking over MAGA Action,&#34; tweeted Taylor Budowich, the director of communications for former President Trump and his Save America PAC. &#34;Corey Lewandowski will be going on to other endeavors and we very much want to thank him for his service. He will no longer be associated with Trump World.&#34;
The move comes the same day allegations were published against Lewandowski claiming he made unwanted sexual advances against Trashelle Odom, a Trump donor.
&#34;On the evening of September 26 in Las Vegas, Nevada, I attended a dinner to support a charity and spend time with wonderful friends,&#34; Odom 
told
 Politico. &#34;He repeatedly touched me inappropriately, said vile and disgusting things to me, stalked me, and made me feel violated and fearful,&#34; she said, referring to Lewandowski.
GOV. KRISTI NOEM DENIES ALLEGATION OF AFFAIR WITH COREY LEWANDOWSKI: ‘TOTAL GARBAGE’
&#34;I am coming forward because he needs to be held accountable,&#34; Odom continued. &#34;I am blessed to have a loving husband and family behind me. I want other women to know that you can be heard, too, and together we can stop terrible things like this from happening.&#34;
Lewandowski did not immediately respond to the allegations publicly, but his lawyer David Z. Chesnoff said that the &#34;accusations and rumor appear to be morphing by the minute and we will not dignify them with a further response,&#34; according to 
The New York Times

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin activated the civil reserve air fleet to help the U.S. military evacuate Afghan and American refugees. Fox News&#39; David Spunt with more.
Secretary of Defense
 Lloyd Austin said Sunday that intelligence assessments on the 
U.S. military
 withdrawal from 
Afghanistan
 predicted the Taliban could retake the country in a matter of months, appearing to contradict 
President Biden&#39;s
 reassurances last month that a Taliban takeover was not inevitable.
During an interview with ABC News’ Martha Raddatz at the 
Pentagon
, Austin declared that &#34;nobody&#34; in the intelligence community predicted the Afghan government would fall to the Taliban as rapidly as it did.
AFGHANISTAN BLAME GAME INTENSIFIES AS WHITE HOUSE, PENTAGON AND INTEL POINT FINGERS
&#34;There were assessments that ranged initially from one to two years to, you know, several months,&#34; he said. &#34;But it was a wide range of assessments. And as the Taliban began to make gains, and we saw that in a number of cases there was less fighting and more surrendering and more forces just kind of evaporating, it was very difficult to predict with accuracy. 
&#34;This all occurred in a span of about 11 days,&#34; he added. &#34;Nobody predicted that, you know, the government would fall in 11 days.&#34;
Asked by Raddatz whether he thought the planning for the military’s withdrawal from the region was &#34;acceptable and appropriate,&#34; Austin responded, &#34;I do, based upon what we were looking at.&#34;
&#34;Like everyone else, the president listened to our input,&#34; he said. &#34;Again, he conducted a very rigorous and thoughtful process and he made a decision. And I support that decision.&#34;
Austin’s comments about intel lie in contrast to what Biden 
said on July 8
 about how a Taliban-takeover was not likely and that he trusted &#34;the capacity of the Afghan military.&#34;
When confronted by a reporter who said, &#34;Your own intelligence community has assessed that the Afghan government will likely collapse,&#34; Biden fired back at the time, saying, &#34;That is not true.&#34;
&#34;They did not reach that conclusion,&#34; the president said. &#34;The Afghan government and leadership has to come together. They clearly have the capacity to sustain the government in place. The question is: Will they generate the kind of cohesion to do it? It’s not a question of whether they have the capacity. They have the capacity.&#34;
&#34;There’s not a conclusion that, in fact, they cannot defeat the Taliban,&#34; he added.
Asked directly at the time whether a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan was &#34;inevitable,&#34; Biden responded, &#34;No, it is not.&#34;
Biden spoke from the White House on Monday, saying the Taliban&#39;s retaking of Afghanistan 20 years after their ouster by U.S.-led forces &#34;did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated&#34; but that he still stood &#34;squarely behind&#34; his decision to withdraw troops.

The president declared toward the end of his speech that &#34;the buck stops&#34; with him, but not before blaming his predecessor, former President Trump, for negotiating a peace deal with the Taliban that made the current president have to choose between &#34;escalating the conflict and sending thousands of American troops back into Afghanistan.&#34;
Biden also pointed fingers
 at the Afghan army for lacking &#34;the will to fight&#34; for their future. And he said the slow-moving pace of evacuating the U.S.&#39;s Afghan allies was in part because &#34;some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlier – still hopeful for their country.&#34;

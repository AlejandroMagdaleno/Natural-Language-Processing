Chuck Schumer
, D-N.Y., scuttled Sen. 
Mitch McConnell
&#39;s plans for a news conference Tuesday afternoon at the Capitol, sparking a rare moment of laughter from the typically stoic McConnell. 
The camera-savvy Schumer saw that McConnell, R-Ky., was heading to the TV microphones Tuesday afternoon to address the press corps when the New York Democrat picked up his pace and beat him to the lectern.

&#34;You all remember what they used to say about Chuck over in the House: ‘You never want to get between Chuck and the camera,’&#34; McConnell quipped. &#34;I just had a firsthand experience with that. I must say he was quite good at beating me to the microphone.&#34;

Fox News contributor reacts to the president&#39;s performance abroad
President Biden
 on Monday mistakenly characterized his recent trip to 
Europe
 as notably longer than the 8 days he visited for.
During a virtual speech for the Democratic National Party, the president said his trip lasted 13 days, tacking on an additional five days
&#34;I just got back, by the way, from Europe, after being there for I guess 13 days – I forget how many days,&#34; Biden said. &#34;And I met for five days with the G-7 nations.&#34;
The G-7 summit in Cornwall took place over three days.
He said he wouldn’t go through &#34;all the details&#34; as it would be &#34;too boring for you,&#34; before noting that the damage done to the U.S. by President Donald Trump on the international stage was &#34;incredible.&#34;
During Monday’s speech, Biden noted that he made clear to Russian President Vladimir Putin that the relationship between the U.S. and Russia needs to be stable and predictable, on the heels of several high-profile cyberattacks that crippled major U.S. operations and were said to be initiated by groups with ties to Russia. He noted that he would respond to actions that harm U.S. interests.

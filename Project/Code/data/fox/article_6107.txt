Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows argues House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is using the National Guard in Washington, D.C. as a &#39;messaging billboard for the Democrat Party.&#39; 
Former 
White House
 chief of staff Mark Meadows pushed back on heightened security at the 
Capitol building
 on Wednesday, arguing that 
House
 Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 is using the 
National Guard
 for a &#34;political statement&#34; instead of safety.
&#34;There&#39;s no actionable intelligence that would suggest that we should have National Guard troops still here in Washington, D.C.,&#34; Meadows told FOX Business&#39; &#34;
Mornings with Maria
.&#34;
&#34;[Pelosi&#39;s] trying to continue to put up not only the fencing but the National Guard and the razor wire here in Washington, D.C., to try to remind Americans that she is now in control. But I can tell you that the vast majority of Americans are telling Speaker Pelosi, &#39;Tear down that wall.&#39;&#34;
Meadows joined 
calls from Republican lawmakers
 demanding answers from the House speaker on what she knew and when regarding Capitol security on the day of the January 6 riot.
&#34;When the truth comes out, we&#39;ll see that indeed there are other decisions that could have been made by Speaker Pelosi and others that weren&#39;t made,&#34; Meadows said. 
&#34;Then-President Trump offered up as many as 10,000 National Guard prior to January 6th. And yet in typical fashion, they said, &#39;Oh, no, we can handle it. We don&#39;t want the look.&#39; Now, when it serves a political purpose, they want the lookout there.&#34;
A Pentagon spokesperson 
told Fox News&#39; Neil Cavuto Tuesday
 that the National Guard will remove the last of its troops by mid-March as an 
internal email obtained by FOX 5 DC
 suggested troops could stay in Washington until Fall 2021. 
House Republicans say they have 
received &#34;zero information&#34; from Pelosi
 about why troops remain at the Capitol.
&#34;It&#39;s amazing to me that [Pelosi] can do this without any disclosure, without any information and just continue to spend money with no briefing,&#34; Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
&#34; Monday.

Meadows believes the security decision should be a &#34;measured approach&#34; made jointly by the 
FBI
, 
Department of Defense
, 
Department of Justice
, and Capitol Police, with a goal of safety without using the National Guard as a &#34;messaging billboard for the Democrat Party.&#34;
&#34;It is time that we actually make sure that our cities and our states are indeed safe and indeed the capital is safe, but it&#39;s not time for a political statement,&#34; Meadows said.

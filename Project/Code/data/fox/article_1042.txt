President Biden appears to have erased Dr. Seuss from &#34;Read Across America Day&#34;, the annual celebration of reading in honor of the legendary children&#39;s author, whose birthday falls on March 2.
While Biden followed presidential tradition in proclaiming Tuesday &#34;Read Across America Day,&#34; he bucked his predecessors by leaving out any mention of Dr. Seuss from the proclamation.
The White House didn&#39;t immediately return a request for comment on why Dr. Seuss was left out of the proclamation, but the snub comes as progressives have sought to cancel the beloved children&#39;s author. 
One of Virginia&#39;s biggest school districts, Loudoun County Public Schools, reportedly nixed Dr. Seuss from the school&#39;s &#34;Read Across America Day&#34; celebration, citing alleged racial &#34;undertones&#34; in his children&#39;s books.

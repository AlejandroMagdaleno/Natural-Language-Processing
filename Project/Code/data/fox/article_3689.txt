House Oversight Committee member calls for a broader investigation into Capitol Hill violence on &#39;Your World&#39;
The FBI is &#34;reviewing&#34; congressional requests for investigations into the &#34;role&#34; 
Parler,
 
Facebook and Twitter 
played in the Capitol riot earlier this month, Fox News has learned.
House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y.,
 last week
 requested that the FBI investigate Parler’s &#34;role&#34; as a &#34;potential facilitator&#34; of planning or inciting the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6.
HOUSE OVERSIGHT GOP SAYS ANY FBI INVESTIGATION INTO PARLER&#39;S &#39;ROLE&#39; IN CAPITOL RIOTS &#39;SHOULD ALSO INCLUDE&#39; FACEBOOK, TWITTER
On Monday, Republicans on the committee demanded that any potential FBI investigation into Parler’s involvement 
&#34;should include&#34; Facebook and Twitter
 as well, saying the three social media companies &#34;seem to all share blame in allowing their platforms to be used to plan for the January 6 riot.&#34;
The FBI on Tuesday told Fox News that they are reviewing the requests.
&#34;We have no comment on the specifics of the investigation, but we are reviewing these requests from members of Congress,&#34; the FBI told Fox News.
Maloney also asked the FBI last week to review whether Parler is &#34;a potential conduit for foreign governments who may be financing civil unrest in the United States.&#34;
HOUSE OVERSIGHT DEMOCRATS DEMAND FBI PROBE OF PARLER&#39;S ROLE IN CAPITOL RIOT
But committee Ranking Member James Comer, R-Ky., and Rep. Greg Steube, R-Fla., slammed Maloney, saying her request, singling out just Parler &#34;known for its conservative users&#34; was &#34;blatantly and overtly partisan.&#34;
Comer and Steube said Maloney’s claim that Parler was a &#34;potential facilitator&#34; of planning for the Capitol chaos &#34;completely omits the fact that other social media platforms were also facilitators of the January 6 riot.&#34;
Comer and Steube went on to call Maloney’s request for an FBI investigation into Parler &#34;a transparently political ploy taking advantage of the tragedy that occurred on January 6 to shut down speech Democrats dislike.&#34;
&#34;Perhaps more disturbing is a Silicon Valley willing to oblige these impulses,&#34; they wrote. &#34;We request you amend your request for an FBI investigation to include Facebook and Twitter and the roles those companies played to contribute to the January 6 riot.&#34;
PARLER &#39;WELCOMES&#39; FBI INVESTIGATION INTO COMPANY&#39;S &#39;ROLE&#39; IN JANUARY 6 CAPITOL RIOT
Neither Facebook nor Twitter responded to Fox News’ request for comment regarding a potential FBI investigation into the platforms.
But Parler COO Jeffrey Wernick said the company &#34;welcomes&#34; a &#34;robust examination of our policies and actions&#34; by the bureau.
&#34;Like other social-media platforms, we have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with law-enforcement efforts to identify and prosecute those individuals responsible for organizing and carrying out the shameless Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.
&#34;Parler welcomes Rep. Maloney’s call to have the Federal Bureau of Investigation conduct a robust examination of our policies and actions,&#34; Wernick said.

The 
Kansas 
Senate voted on Wednesday to approve a bill that would ban 
transgender
 girls on female sports teams, according to reports.
The bill passed 24-10 in the Republican-controlled legislature and would require public 
schools 
and state colleges to categorize sports teams based on an athlete’s gender at birth.
&#34;What we heard in testimony is that there are parents and there are student-athletes that want to compete against folks that have that same physical makeup,&#34; Sen. Molly Baumgardner, a Republican and chair of the education committee, said, according to KSNT-TV in Topeka, Kansas.
The bill has reportedly been a priority for Kansas Republicans. 
The Family Policy Alliance of Kansas hailed the advancement of the bill as a  &#34;victory&#34; for women and girls in the state.
MISSISSIPPI GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL BANNING TRANSGENDER ATHLETES FROM FEMALE SPORTS 
&#34;Girls desire a fair playing field. That is all this bill provides,&#34; Brittany Jones, the alliance’s Director of Advocacy said in a statement, according to WIBW-TV in Topeka. &#34;To every female athlete – this is a declaration that there is a place for you to shoot for the stars in Kansas.&#34;
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, has called the bill &#34;regressive&#34; and Senate Democratic Leader Dinah Sykes said the vote was a failure in &#34;compassionate government and leadership.&#34; She said it shows &#34;how little…elected representatives value [trans] lives and contributions to our state,&#34; 
WIBW
 reported.
Other opponents of the bill have said it would lead to bullying. 
But Senate President Ty Masterson, a Republican, argued the bill isn’t about &#34;sexuality, it is not about orientation, it is not about identity, it is not about discrimination. What it is about very simply, fair competition in women’s sports.&#34;
He called categorizing teams by gender assigned at birth &#34;basic science,&#34; 
KSNT 
reported.

The bill now heads to the House. The governor hasn’t said if she plans to veto it if it passes out of the House.
More than a dozen other states are reportedly considering similar bills and 
Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves just signed a bill 
banning trans girls on girls&#39; sports teams last week.

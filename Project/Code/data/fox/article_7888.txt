In a series of ads, the Republican National Committee is hammering 
Vice President Harris
 for traveling to California to campaign for Gov. 
Gavin 
Newsom
 
while Californians are still stranded in Afghanistan.
The ads hold nothing back ripping into the vice president as she gallivants around California with the embattled governor.
One ad is making its rounds on a mobile billboard pointing out that Harris is campaigning for Newsom as he faces a tight recall election while a number of Californians – including 
24 Sacramento students
 and a 
3-year-old toddler
 – are trapped in Afghanistan.

&#34;Californians are stranded in Afghanistan. Where’s Kamala?&#34; the mobile billboard says. &#34;Campaigning in California.&#34;
Another ad torched Harris for campaigning for Newsom amid the crisis, saying that while she does so &#34;California children are stranded behind enemy lines in Afghanistan&#34; and encouraging people to sign a petition to tell Harris &#34;to do her job.&#34;

RNC spokesperson Hallie Balch told Fox News in an emailed statement that Harris and President Biden should be focused more on saving Americans than Newsom’s gubernatorial gig.
&#34;Instead of trying to save Gavin Newsom’s job, the embattled governor, President Biden, and Vice President Harris should be doing everything they can to get stranded California children home from Afghanistan safely,&#34; Balch wrote.

&#34;Our digital mobile billboard and online ads will make it clear to Californians just what sits on top of Democrats’ priority list: political power,&#34; she continued.
The vice president’s office did not provide comment on the ads to Fox News.
DNC rapid response director Ammar Moussa blasted the ads in a Wednesday statement to Fox News.
&#34;The RNC’s shameless politicization of the end of a 20-year war would almost be believable if they hadn’t spent a year and a half celebrating Donald Trump negotiating with the Taliban,&#34; Moussa wrote.
&#34;The American people overwhelmingly support our withdrawal, and thanks to the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris, more than 120,000 Americans and our allies were successfully evacuated in the largest airlift in our history. Maybe that’ll make it in the RNC’s next ad,&#34; he continued.

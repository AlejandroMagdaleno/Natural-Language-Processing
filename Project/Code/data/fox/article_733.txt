BIDEN DOJ ASKS TRUMP-APPOINTED US ATTORNEYS TO RESIGN
Many Americans first became familiar with Garland in 2016, when former President Barack Obama nominated him to fill a U.S. Supreme Court vacancy after Associated Justice Antonin Scalia died in February of that year.
But then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other Republicans argued that Garland’s nomination should not be considered during an election year, and the court pick should instead go to the winner of that November’s presidential election.

The vacancy was ultimately filled by President Donald Trump, who selected Judge Neil Gorsuch to succeed Scalia. The Senate confirmed Gorsuch’s nomination April 7, 2017, and he remains on the Supreme Court.
Garland previously served in senior positions in the Justice Department and was a supervisor of the prosecution of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, according to The Associated Press.

Fox News contributor Leo Terrell rips the progressive backlash against the Georgia election reform bill.
Intimidating corporations with racism accusations is &#34;Rev. Al Sharpton’s playbook,&#34; Fox News contributor Leo Terrell said on Tuesday in the wake of progressive backlash against the 
Georgia
 
election
 reform bill.
&#34;In Georgia, they&#39;ve made it easier to vote, harder to cheat,&#34; Terrell told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
.&#34; 
Terrell noted that though the MLB All-Star game was 
moved
 from Georgia to Colorado over disapproval of the election reform bill, the Peach State has more early voting days. 
&#34;The argument is corporations are intimidated by the allegation of racism. That&#39;s the Al Sharpton playbook. You intimidate, you accuse someone of racism. And they back down. And that&#39;s why Coca-Cola and all these corporations are afraid of that label,&#34; Terrell said.
GEORGIA VOTING LAW CHANGES ARE OK WITH AMERICANS, 42% TO 36%: POLL
Terrell said that corporations are afraid of racism allegations while such claims have gone rampant.
&#34;I mean, a couple of days ago, the Portland School District was talking about it, a tree being racist. It&#39;s out of control, totally out of control,&#34; Terrell said.
&#34;And it&#39;s all about power.&#34;

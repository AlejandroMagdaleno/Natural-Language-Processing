Carl Levin, 
Michigan
’s longest-serving senator, has died at the age of 87, Fox News confirmed late Thursday. 
Levin, a Harvard-educated civil rights attorney and former taxi driver, was known for being a powerful voice on military issues and as a staunch supporter of the auto industry. 
Former President Obama said in 2013, &#34;If you’ve ever worn the uniform, worked a shift on an assembly line, or sacrificed to make ends meet, then you’ve had a voice and a vote in Sen. Carl Levin.&#34;

Fox2Detroit reported
 that Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich., his nephew, released a statement praising his uncle for putting &#34;the public good above self-interest.&#34;
&#34;As he walked about the Capitol in a rumpled suit, almost always with a plain white shirt and pedestrian tie, carrying bulging files with the occasional paper flying away, Carl was the very picture of sober purpose and rectitude. In truth, he wasn’t unfun,&#34; he said. &#34;In fact, he often pierced tense situations with self-deprecating humor, and he privately shared incisive observations about others with staff and colleagues.&#34;
Levin, a Democrat, published a recent memoir called, &#34;Getting to the Heart of the Matter: My 36 Years in the Senate,&#34; and revealed that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer a few years earlier, the Detroit Free Press 
reported.

He remained a powerful voice from the left, and the paper pointed out that he recently penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in defense of the filibuster and called the initiative to repeal it &#34;shortsighted.&#34;
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the state’s Democrat, tweeted out that Levin was a &#34;champion for Michigan.&#34;

Rep. Ronny Jackson
, the former 
White House
 physician-turned-congressman, says he’s &#34;terrified for our country&#34; in the wake of 
President Joe Biden’s
 televised town hall this week — and doubts whether the commander in chief has the cognitive ability to make it through a full term.
&#34;He’s completely LOST it!&#34; Jackson, R-Texas, tweeted Saturday, along with a video clip in which Biden answers a reporter’s question about defunding the police by claiming that Republicans accuse him of &#34;sucking the blood out of kids.&#34;
&#34;Needs a cognitive exam NOW!&#34; Jackson posted.
In 
Biden’s
 performance on CNN Wednesday night, widely mocked by conservatives on social media, he made false assertions about the efficacy of 
COVID
 
vaccines
, talked about helping children &#34;find out whether there’s a man on the moon or whether those aliens are here or not&#34; and confused some in the audience with references to obscure conspiracy theories.
&#34;I mean, Qanon, the idea that the 
Democrats
 or that Biden is hiding people and sucking the blood of children and — no, I’m serious,&#34; he said.
Earlier this month, Biden was forced to rely on notes to answer a reporter’s question at a 
Michigan
 pie shop.
&#34;This is a national security issue at this point,&#34; Jackson told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Thursday.
&#34;I think he’s either going to resign — they’re going to convince him to resign from office at some point in the near future for medical issues — or they’re going to have to use the 25th Amendment to get rid of this man,&#34; Jackson said.

Last month Jackson, who served as the personal physician of both 
President Obama
 and 
President Trump
, joined a dozen Republican House members in a letter calling on Biden to take a cognitive function test — as Trump did while he was in office — and publicly release the results.
&#34;The American people … deserve full transparency on the mental capabilities of their highest elected leader,&#34; the Republicans wrote.
&#34;I’ve been saying that it’s only going to get worse,&#34; Jackson said Thursday on Fox News. &#34;And guess what? We’re watching that happen right before our eyes right now.&#34;

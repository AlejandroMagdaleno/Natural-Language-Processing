Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., discusses impeachment efforts, reflects on Trump’s legacy on ‘America’s Newsroom.’
Sen. 
Rand Paul
 said Wednesday he fears Republicans will &#34;destroy the party&#34; if they support former 
President Trump
&#39;s conviction during his Senate 
impeachment 
trial.
&#34;I think it is a hugely partisan exercise on the part of the Democrats, Paul told Fox News&#39; &#34;
America&#39;s Newsroom
. &#34;But for Republicans who go along with it, I think they will destroy our party. Donald Trump isn’t everything in the party but he did bring a lot of people to the party.&#34; 
Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives for the second time in his presidency on Jan. 13 on an article of &#34;incitement of insurrection&#34; at the U.S. Capitol.
Trump is now out of office, making the idea of removing him moot, but opponents are eager to disqualify him from any future run for office.

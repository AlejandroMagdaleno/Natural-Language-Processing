After vowing to never accept funds from corporate Political Action Committees (PACs) during her 2018 campaign, 
Rep. Elaine Luria
, D-Va., reversed her stance and accepted over $30,000 to cover 2020 campaign debts.

Luria raised nearly 
$6.7 million
 for her 2020 campaign, but by the end of her race, she owed more than $107,000 with only $103,000 in the bank – prompting her to turn towards contributions from PACs affiliated with Altria, Boeing, General Dynamics, Google, Raytheon, and Rolls Royce North America, first reported

endorsed
 Luria, but have since condemned her reversal.
&#34;If you want to know why it’s so problematic [that Rep. Elaine Luria] has broken her #NoCorporatePAC pledge to voters in [Virginia] just tune in and listen to… 2018 Elaine Luria,&#34; the group wrote in a December tweet, before posting a 2018 video of her announcing that &#34;a key tenet&#34; of her campaign was that she was &#34;not accepting any corporate PAC contributions.&#34;

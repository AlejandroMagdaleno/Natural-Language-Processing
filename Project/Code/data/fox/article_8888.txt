Texas Gov. 
Greg Abbott
 signed a bill that broadens the scope of who can be charged with human smuggling, while raising the stakes for

This raises the maximum jail time for the offense from 10 years to 20.

The law comes at a time when Texas is facing a border crisis most recently highlighted by thousands of people from Haiti illegally crossing from Mexico into the city of Del Rio. The Department of Homeland Security said that as of Wednesday they had deported 1,719 people back to Haiti. Meanwhile, Border Patrol agents have told Fox News that those being removed are generally single men and women, while family units and women claiming to be pregnant (and their partners) are being released.

Bryan Llenas reports on the two controversies the New York governor is facing.
Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
’s love life has been rocky, and sometimes cringe-worthy, for years — since well before 
a second former aide accused him of sexual harassment
 on the job on Feb. 27.
Briefly the hearthrob of some swooning liberals — 
who called themselves &#34;Cuomosexuals&#34;
 at the height of the governor’s daily COVID-19 briefings last year — Cuomo, 63, has made no secret that he’s on the prowl after a very public breakup in 2019.
One of those Cuomosexuals was comedian Chelsea Handler.
But when the LA-based comic asked him out online, the gov ghosted her, she joked last October, a year after his breakup with 14-year girlfriend and celebrity chef Sandra Lee.

NY GOV. CUOMO, SO-CALLED &#39;LOVE GOV,&#39; JOKED WITH CNN HOST BRO 2 MONTHS BEFORE 2ND ALLEGED SEX HARASSMENT
&#34;I’m a big fan of Chelsea’s and she is great and we have fun but on my dating life, you know, I am only dating at this point in-state residents,&#34;
 Cuomo said during an appearance
 in October on &#34;The View,&#34; presumably referring to the still-raging COVID-19 crisis.

&#34;On a human level, on a social level,&#34; 
he jokingly lamented
 to &#34;The Daily Show&#34; host Trevor Noah, also in October, &#34;nobody wants to have dinner with me.&#34;
Cuomo was married to Kerry Kennedy, the seventh child of Robert F. Kennedy, from 1990 until 2005.
They share daughters Cara Ethel Kennedy-Cuomo, Mariah Matilda Kennedy-Cuomo and Michaela Kennedy-Cuomo.
Why the two split has never been made clear.
However, an excerpt from &#34;The Contender,&#34; a Cuomo biography that 
was published in Vanity Fair
, says tension in their relationship arose early on, and Kennedy even insisted the couple seek marriage counseling — but Cuomo was too consumed with work.    
That same year his divorce was finalized, the governor began a relationship with Food Network host Lee, and the couple moved in together in 2011.

However, the couple’s 14-year relationship 
officially ended in September 2019
, and Cuomo has repeatedly intimated publicly since then that he was looking for love.
&#34;Do you think you are an attractive person now because you’re single and ready to mingle?&#34; the governor’s CNN host brother, Chris, 
teased him
 on his show,
 
&#34;Cuomo Prime Time&#34;
&#34;No,&#34; 
the governor griped
 to WAMC radio host Alan Chartock, who asked him on air last summer whether he was dating anyone. &#34;What happened to the women you are recommending?&#34; he chided Chartock.

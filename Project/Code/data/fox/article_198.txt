Alyssa Milano
 may trade in one acting setting for another as she considers whether or not she’ll leave Hollywood for a potential 
House 
seat in 2024.
&#34;I’m looking at 
California
’s 4th District to potentially run against [Rep. Tom] McClintock, R-Calif.,&#34; the actress-turned-activist told 
The Hill
 on Tuesday.
&#34;I split my time between Truckee, Calif., and Bell Canyon, Calif., and the Republicans have basically had a strong arm there in the 4th District,&#34; the &#34;Charmed&#34; actress, 48, said.
McClintock has served as the U.S. Representative for California&#39;s 4th Congressional District since 2009 and was reelected in November’s election with 56% of the vote. Donald Trump has also beaten President Biden in the district by nine points.

&#34;I would love to maybe consider flipping that seat blue,&#34; the &#34;Insatiable&#34; star continued. &#34;It&#39;s going to take someone with, I think, name recognition and deep pockets to be able to run against McClintock, and so I&#39;m considering it. I&#39;m basically gathering information right now, speaking to different consultants, speaking to the community.&#34;
Milano said a decision on the matter could come after the 2022 midterm elections as she is currently maintaining a number of projects including a Netflix film she recently wrapped up filming and a fresh installment of &#34;Who’s the Boss.&#34;

&#34;Before I run, obviously I can’t do both at the same time,&#34; she says of her acting work. &#34;So it’s just really going to be about timing.&#34;
The outspoken performer even asked her 3.6 million Twitter followers last month if she should run against McClintock.
She also gave a favorable rating to Biden and said he has done a &#34;really great job&#34; thus far during his time in office but lamented, &#34;there&#39;s a lot left to do, obviously, in particular gun violence prevention.&#34;
Following the Boulder, Colo., shooting in March that left 10 people dead including a police officer, Milano wasted no time pushing for changes in gun laws 
on Twitter
 and pressed for gun violence to be &#34;eradicated&#34; as she called for filibuster restructuring.

Milano also commented on other celebrities like Caitlyn Jenner and Matthew McConaughey possibly throwing their hats in the political ring in California and Texas, respectively.
&#34;I would hope that they would put in the work before they attempt to hold office,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;ve been an activist since I was 15 years old. The first pictures of me in the White House are with Nancy Reagan.&#34;’

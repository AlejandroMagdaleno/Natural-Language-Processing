Jalina Porter, deputy spokesperson for the 
U.S. State Department
 under 
President Biden
, said she should have &#34;chosen words that were less passionate and spur-of-the moment&#34; after her 2016 Facebook post claiming the &#34;largest threat to U.S. national security are U.S. cops&#34; came to light.
&#34;Comments I made five years ago on my personal Facebook account as a private citizen were in response to the uncomfortable – and deeply painful – truth of race-based violence in America that has continued ever since,&#34; Porter said in a statement on Tuesday. &#34;The pain I expressed was real. Nevertheless, I should’ve chosen words that were less passionate and spur-of-the moment, as well as more constructive.&#34;
BIDEN STATE DEPT. SPOKESWOMAN CALLED POLICE &#39;LARGEST THREAT TO US NATIONAL SECURITY&#39;: REPORT
&#34;I, of course, know well that not all law enforcement officers pose a threat to our community. Today, I am proud to stand as the State Department’s first Black woman Deputy Spokesperson, a position that affords me an opportunity to be part of the ongoing conversation regarding nationwide equity and inclusion, as we work to enhance the power of America’s example overseas,&#34; Porter continued.

In a 2016 Facebook post, Porter 
wrote
 that U.S. cops posed the largest national security threat, greater than that of both Russian hackers and ISIS, because of killings of Black Americans.
&#34;The largest threat to U.S. national security are U.S. cops,&#34; Porter said, as reported by 
The Washington Free Beacon
. &#34;Not ISIS, not Russian hackers, not anyone or anything else.&#34;
&#34;If ya&#39;ll don&#39;t wake up and rise up to this truth, the genocide against Blacks in America will continue until we are near extinct,&#34; Porter said. &#34;That’s not the world I seek to live in or create for myself and those around me.&#34;

Porter’s comments, according to the publication, were made in September 2016 – shortly after a video was released of an unarmed Black man, Terence Crutcher, being shot by police in Tulsa, Okla.
Porter previously served as a congressional staff member for Rep. Jerry McNerney, D-Calif., and former Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., who is a White House senior adviser.

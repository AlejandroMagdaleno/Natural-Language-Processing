President Biden
 arrived to speak in Columbus, Ohio on Tuesday where a &#34;small&#34; crowd of supporters and protesters awaited his arrival, according to a local report.
Several supporters gathered to greet the president’s motorcade, ABC Television affiliate 
WSYX
 reported, noting that the crowd had roughly doubled in size by the time Biden was leaving.

In addition to supporters, the report noted that there were about 20 protesters present, some of whom were waving Trump 2020 flags, and there was at least one sign that read &#34;Biden is not my president.&#34;

Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., didn’t mince words in his first appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), telling the crowd that &#34;brutal and vicious&#34; Democrats were trying to turn the U.S. into a &#34;Communist ash heap.&#34; 
Cawthorn said the U.S. is &#34;walking down a road very near socialism. They are trying to turn this country into a  Communist ash heap. It is not enough take on the status quo and say, I’ll just patiently wait for my time.&#34; 
&#34;My friends. If we do that we will not have a country to inherit. We have to make sure our country is responsible or, my friends, we will lose this nation,&#34; he continued. 
&#34;They are trying to take away all of our rights and they are playing for keeps,&#34; Cawthorn said. He called for young conservatives like himself to &#34;take responsibility&#34; and make their voice known.

&#34;I’m not going to come up here and promise you free things. As a conservative in government, we believe we are going to offer you something that is immeasurably more valuable-- your freedom.&#34;  
Cawthorn said many in government are trying to &#34;buy votes&#34; with promises like Medicare-for-All and student loan forgiveness.

&#34;It’s intellectually dishonest to think Americans are too naive to know in the end, we’re the ones who will have to foot the bill,&#34; he continued.

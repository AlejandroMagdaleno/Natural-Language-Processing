Legendary singer Nina Simone’s granddaughter accused 
Vice President Kamala Harris
 of causing the family to lose control of Simone&#39;s estate while Harris was 
California
 attorney general.
DEM REP CUELLAR SAYS HE HAS NOT HEARD FROM VP HARRIS ON BORDER VISIT
&#34;Nina’s granddaughter here,&#34; ReAnna Simone Kelly wrote on 
Twitter
 on Saturday. &#34;My family doesn’t run her estate anymore. It was taken away from us [and] given to white people. Our family name was DRAGGED in the media. We get NO royalties, nothing. Wanna hold someone accountable? Ask Kamala Harris why she came for my family.&#34;
&#34;As I said before, Ask her why she separated my family,&#34; she continued. &#34;Ask her why my grandmothers estate is in SHAMBLES now. Ask her why we as her family no longer own the rights to anything. Ask her why she bullied my mother in court and my mom almost killed herself from the depression.&#34;
A 2016 
settlement
 regarding the Nina Simone Charitable Trust refers to Harris multiple times for her &#34;primary responsibility for supervising charitable trusts in California&#34; as state attorney general.
&#34;The Attorney General asserts that [Lisa Simone] Kelly breached her fiduciary duty to the Estate and to the Charitable Trust and wrongfully diverted Estate assets. The Attorney General seeks to surcharge Kelly for amounts totaling $5,937,749.42 plus over $2.5 million in interest, which the Attorney General contends is far more than one-half of the Estate&#39;s value during [Lisa Simone] Kelly&#39;s administration of the Estate,&#34; the settlement reads.

&#34;OH WAIT, While we’re asking Kamala questions ask her why after all of this pain and suffering she put us through a Nina Simone song was sang at the inauguration to swear her in as VP?! She knew what she was doing,&#34; ReAnna Simone Kelly continued.

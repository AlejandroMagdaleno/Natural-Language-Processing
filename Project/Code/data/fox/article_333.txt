Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 said she disagrees with 
President-elect Biden
 on his &#34;optimistic&#34; view of the GOP. 
&#34;This is one area where I believe that there&#39;s kind of a track record of some slight disagreement between the president-elect and myself, and I say that, you know - this is it, it&#39;s not a fight - it&#39;s just a disagreement,&#34; the New York Democrat said in a virtual town hall on Friday.  
&#34;I believe that President-elect Biden has a very optimistic view of the Republican Party. He, he has made statements on, you know, once Trump is gone, they will see the error of their ways. And I applaud his optimism but I disagree with his assessment,&#34; she continued. 
BIDEN JUST ANNOUNCED HIS STIMULUS PLAN-- AND AOC ALREADY HAS A PROBLEM WITH IT 
Ocasio-Cortez  said she was concerned about Democrats attempting to &#34;water down [COVID] relief&#34; while they have the congressional majority to &#34;appease Republicans.&#34;
This week, the president-elect unveiled a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal that includes $1,400 stimulus checks, $400 extended unemployment, state and local government funding, rental assistance and a moratorium on evictions, among other priorities. 
The $1,400 together with the most recent COVID relief bill&#39;s $600 stimulus checks 
is not enough
, Ocasio-Cortez said. &#34;$2,000 means $2,000. $2,000 does not mean $1,400,″ she told The Washington Post. 
In a follow-up tweet, Ocasio-Cortez argued that Congress should provide retroactive unemployment relief, in addition to the $400 per week that Biden included in his proposal.
&#34;We can&#39;t be slow walking or minimizing or hedging our ambitions because of Republicans, because this country elected Democrats and we elected a Democratic majority to get them health care, to get them stimulus checks, to get them rent protection, all of which are provisions that are included in Biden&#39;s relief plan that I&#39;m thrilled are included in Biden&#39;s relief plan and that we look forward to expanding and building upon,&#34; the progressive firebrand said. 
AOC SUGGESTION OF COMMISSION TO &#39;REIN IN&#39; MEDIA SLAMMED AS &#39;WHOLLY UN-AMERICAN&#39;
Biden throughout his campaign touted his work across the aisle during his decades in Congress, and giving Republicans a spot front and center at the Democratic National Convention. 
When Biden chose former Ohio Gov. John Kasich to speak at the DNC, Ocasio-Cortez slammed him as an &#34;anti-choice extremist&#34; and &#34;not a friend to workers.&#34;
&#34;People on the extreme, whether they&#39;re on the left or on the right, they get outsized publicity that tends to define their party,&#34; the Ohio Republican clapped back.

&#34;You know, I listen to people all the time make these statements, and because AOC gets outsized publicity doesn&#39;t mean she represents the Democratic Party. She&#39;s just a part, just some member of it.&#34;

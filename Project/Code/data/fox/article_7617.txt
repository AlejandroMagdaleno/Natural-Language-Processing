Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, objects to installing metal detectors at the doors of the House floor. 
Although 
President Trump 
&#34;committed an 
impeachable
 offense,&#34; the House Democrats&#39; articles of impeachment are &#34;flawed,&#34; Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said on Wednesday.
&#34;If that were the case, then I wish that [Rep. Steny Hoyer] and my Democratic colleagues had drafted articles of impeachment better written and taken the time under the Constitution to do it the right way,&#34; Roy told &#34;
America&#39;s Newsroom

Roy said Trump’s conduct was &#34;reprehensible, impeachable, and should be condemned.&#34;
&#34;The problem is that my Democratic colleagues have drafted articles of impeachment that are flawed and that create ongoing issues with respect to what the definition of inciting a riot even is,&#34; Roy said, &#34;and would cause a slippery slope under Article 3 of the 14th amendment that could actually cause us to be starting to shooting each other and target each other in the House of representatives for inciting insurrection.&#34;
RIGHT BACK TO WHERE WE WERE LAST YEAR: DEMS SEEK TRUMP IMPEACHMENT
The House of Representatives is currently debating the articles of impeachment against Trump, alleging that he is &#34;in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States.&#34; The articles declare that &#34;Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States.&#34;

Roy said Trump should not have pressured Vice President Mike Pence to ignore his constitutional duty by rejecting state electors for President-elect Joe Biden.
&#34;I strongly believe that and I think he was wrong to do it and I think it condemnable. I wish my Democratic colleagues worked with us to draft better articles,&#34; Roy said.

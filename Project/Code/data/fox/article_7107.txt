Rep. Susan Wild, D-Penn., on Tuesday night said she was &#34;disappointed&#34; in the 
Biden administration 
for the lack of results in handling the crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border.
&#34;I will be very honest with you and tell you I am a little bit disappointed. I know that the President assigned responsibility for the border crisis to the Vice President,&#34; Wild 
said
 during a telephone town hall. &#34;I&#39;m a little bit disappointed I haven&#39;t seen much in the way of results.&#34;
During the town hall, Wild also hit Biden for repeating the talking point about his &#34;Build Back Better&#34; agenda costing &#34;nothing,&#34; saying it&#39;s &#34;hard for people to believe that&#34; when he doesn&#39;t follow up with any details about how the $3.5 trillion bill will be paid for. 
&#34;I&#39;m waiting to hear how we make all of this happen at no cost,&#34; Wild added.
MCAULIFFE CALLS BIDEN ‘UNPOPULAR’ IN VIRGINIA AMID BELLWETHER ELECTION
This isn&#39;t the first time that Wild has been critical of Biden. In late August, Wild
 released a statement 
attacking the Biden Administration on the evacuation in 
Afghanistan
, saying the &#34;evacuation process has been egregiously mishandled.&#34;
&#34;In order to move forward, our country will need to receive answers and accountability regarding the cascading failures that led us to this catastrophic moment, and I look forward to using my platform on the House Foreign Affairs Committee to secure answers from the Biden Administration about what went wrong,&#34; Wild said. &#34;Our troops deserve nothing less than a complete and unvarnished account of the truth.&#34;
Wild is not the only Democrat in Congress who has been critical of Biden. Several 
House Democrats
 have taken shots at Biden in recent weeks. Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., who was one of the House Democrats who wanted an immediate vote on the bipartisan infrastructure bill, 
told the New York Times
 that the &#34;way he is governing doesn’t reflect the skills I know he must have from his years as a legislator.&#34;  She also said it was &#34;disappointing and frustrating&#34; to see Biden not fight harder for the legislation he wanted.
Rep. Jim Costa, D-Calif., also 
recently
 criticized Biden over his pitch to 
Congress
 for infrastructure, calling it &#34;disappointing&#34; and saying he spent most of his time talking about the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package.
&#34;Well, if it&#39;s not a priority for him, then maybe it&#39;s just not a priority period,&#34; Costa said. &#34;It&#39;s a priority for me.&#34;

Biden was 
thrown under the bus
 by Virginia&#39;s Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe earlier this week, less than three months after they campaigned together in Northern Virginia.
&#34;We got to get Democrats out to vote,&#34; McAuliffe said. &#34;We are facing a lot of headwinds from Washington, as you know. The president is unpopular today, unfortunately here in Virginia, so we have got to plow through.&#34;
Wild&#39;s office did not respond to a Fox News request for comment.

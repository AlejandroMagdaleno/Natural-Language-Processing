Sen. Tom Cotton R-Ark., dissects the coronavirus stimulus bill and how it is hurting American families while helping the Washington elite.
Sen. Pat Toomey tore into 
President Biden
&#39;s massive 
coronavirus
 relief bill as a partisan wish list, railing against a long-list of provisions in the nearly $2 trillion measure that he said have nothing to do with the pandemic or subsequent economic recession. 
&#34;There is no justification for this bill. There’s no medical justification, there’s pandemic justification, there’s no economic justification,&#34; Toomey, R-Pa., said in a Wednesday speech on the Senate floor. &#34;This isn’t about coming together and doing something about a crisis. This is about a partisan, left-wing wish list.&#34; 
Among the specific funding measures identified by Toomey were the $200 million set aside for The Institute of Museum and Library Services, an independent federal agency that provides grants to libraries and museums, and the $270 million allocated for the National Endowment of the Arts and the Humanities, an institute that had a budget of $253 million in fiscal year 2019.
BIDEN&#39;S RELIEF BILL INCLUDES BILLIONS IN AID FOR STATES THAT DON&#39;T NEED IT
&#34;Oh, that’s COVID related, thank goodness that’s there,&#34; Toomey said sarcastically.
The Pennsylvania Republican also highlighted the inclusion of $91 million for outreach to student loan borrowers — &#34;I don&#39;t even know what that means,&#34; he said — and the nearly $5 billion set aside for socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers.  
Introduced by Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., the $5 billion Emergency Relief for Farmers of Color Act, which would be part of the stimulus bill, would provide direct payments to Black, Hispanic and indigenous farmers. It also includes $1 billion to address systemic racism at the U.S. Agriculture Department and provide legal assistance to farmers of color.
&#34;I say ‘about $4 billion’ because it says ‘such funds as may be necessary,&#39;&#34; Toomey said .&#34;And here’s what the money is for: It’s going to pay off 120% of the debt of these farmers and ranchers.&#34;
SOME FAMILIES COULD RECEIVE UP TO $14,000 FROM BIDEN&#39;S RELIEF BILL
Toomey and other deficit-weary Republicans have criticized the size and scope of the $1.9 trillion legislation, arguing the aid should be better targeted to those who need it the most and slamming Democrats for including provisions unrelated to the pandemic.
The nation&#39;s deficit totaled a record $3.1 trillion for the 2020 fiscal year, and the national debt is on track to hit $28 trillion.
But Democrats have defended the massive spending proposal, arguing the economy is still a far way from its pre-crisis level, with unemployment officially at 6.3%. There are about 10 million more out-of-work Americans than there were a year ago in February, before the crisis began.
The relief measure also includes a third $1,400 stimulus check for Americans earning less than $75,000, increases supplemental unemployment benefits by $400 a week through the end of August, allocates $50 billion toward helping small businesses and gives $350 billion for state and local governments, among other provisions.

Congressional Democrats are planning to use a procedural tool known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill without any Republican buy-ins, with the goal of sending the legislation to Biden&#39;s desk before a March 14 jobless aid cliff.

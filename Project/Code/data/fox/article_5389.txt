 under &#34;Government and Politics&#34; in the Spring of last year.

the first of its kind
 -- 
alongside other Obama-era veterans
 Jen Psaki, Karine Jean Pierre, Elizabeth E. Alexander and Ashley Etienne.
She told the Northside Neighbor in December that the job &#34;means a tremendous amount&#34; and is an &#34;enormous responsibility.&#34; 
&#34;We spent a lot of time looking at the promises that Biden made on the campaign trail and thinking how we’re going to implement those and execute them,&#34; she said. &#34;For my team, that means preparing written materials, thinking through Q&amp;A, thinking about how we explain Joe Biden’s priorities to the American people. That’s one big piece of the work.&#34;
Bedingfield said the second big piece of the work is making sure the administration is answering reporters&#39; questions. 
&#34;Transparency and accountability are incredibly important to President-elect Biden, so we’re working to restore a sense of trust between the administration and the White House and the press and the American people,&#34; she added.
Bedingfield wrote in Nov. 29 tweets that she was &#34;unspeakably proud to have the opportunity to serve&#34; and that it would be an honor to work with &#34;the incredible women who are taking on these roles together.&#34;

Experts say Biden&#39;s pledge to undo his predecessor&#39;s anti-regulatory policies on the environment won&#39;t be accomplished easily, despite a fast start. After taking office last week, Biden returned the U.S. to the Paris climate accords, revoked the Keystone oil pipeline’s federal permit and halted oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

&#34;Communicating directly and truthfully to the American people is one of the most important duties of a President, and this team will be entrusted with the tremendous responsibility of connecting the American people to the White House,&#34; the president 
said in a statement

&#34;I am proud to announce today the first senior White House communications team comprised entirely of women. These qualified, experienced communicators bring diverse perspectives to their work and a shared commitment to building this country back better,&#34; he said.

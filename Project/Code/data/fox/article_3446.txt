 on Tuesday promised his supporters would be very happy when he eventually makes an announcement about whether he will run in the 2024 presidential election.
During an appearance by phone on Candace Owen’s eponymous Daily Wire show &#34;Candace,&#34; Trump said he was &#34;absolutely enthused&#34; and looking forward to &#34;doing an announcement at the right time.&#34;

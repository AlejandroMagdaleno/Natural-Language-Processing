&#34;Fox &amp; Friends&#34; co-host Brian Kilmeade speaks on the political aspects of COVID-19 and critical race theory.
White House
 press secretary Jen Psaki pushed back on 
Florida
 Gov. Ron DeSantis&#39; recent decision about the use of face masks at schools, arguing that public health officials were more suited to make those types of decisions than politicians were.
Fox News&#39; Peter Doocy had asked Psaki about DeSantis considering a plan to withhold funding from school districts that don&#39;t allow parents to opt their kids out of mask-wearing.
&#34;I will say as a parent myself of two young children that I want public health officials to make decisions about how to keep my kids safe, not politicians,&#34; said Psaki.
&#34;And not only is Gov. DeSantis not abiding by public health decisions, he is fundraising off of this.&#34;

She added that the administration&#39;s view was the parents &#34;should have the ability and the knowledge that their kids are going to school and that they&#39;re in safe environments.&#34;
Doocy added that DeSantis had concerns about the psychological impact of mask-wearing on kindergartners. He asked Psaki whether that was something that came up in discussions among officials and the the White House.
&#34;No, there&#39;s not,&#34; Psaki responded. &#34;And I will tell you from personal experience, my rising kindergartner told me two days ago she could wear a mask all day and she&#39;s just happy to go to camp and go to school.&#34;

Her comments added to an ongoing feud between the White House and DeSantis, who made headlines by telling the president to do his job. &#34;Why don&#39;t you get this border secure? And until you do that, I don’t wanna hear a blip about COVID from you, thank you,&#34; said DeSantis.
Biden reportedly knocked DeSantis earlier this week, asking &#34;Governor who?&#34; in response to one of his comments.

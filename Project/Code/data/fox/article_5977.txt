House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy criticizes Democrats for focusing on a $3.5 trillion spending plan as chaos is unfolding in Afghanistan and says President Biden&#39;s foreign policy decisions are putting the U.S. in harm&#39;s way.
House Minority Leader 
Kevin McCarthy
 blasted 
President Biden
 for sticking to an Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline from 
Afghanistan
 and said &#34;thousands of Americans&#34; could be left stranded in the Taliban-controlled country as a result.
&#34;The president&#39;s misguided decisions run the risk of creating the largest international hostage situation we&#39;ve ever faced as a nation,&#34; McCarthy, R-Calif., said at Capitol news conference on Wednesday. 
Biden has faced 
bipartisan criticism
 for honoring the Taliban-backed withdrawal date for U.S. troops of Aug. 31 as Americans and Afghan allies are still seeking evacuation from the Kabul airport. The U.S. military is currently stationed at the airport and undertaking a major logistical operation to get Americans and others on outbound flights from Kabul.

McCarthy called the withdrawal effort in Afghanistan the &#34;the biggest foreign policy failure&#34; and he accused Biden of turning his back on Americans. 
&#34;He turned his back on our own citizens stranded in Afghanistan,&#34; McCarthy said. &#34; … He&#39;s turned his back on his duties as a commander in chief.&#34;

Biden said Tuesday that the U.S was on pace to finish the evacuation by Aug. 31 and said the longer the U.S. stays the more risk American troops will face. He acknowledged the evacuation effort is dependent on cooperation from the Taliban granting safe passage for Americans to the airport. 
&#34;The completion by August 31st depends upon the Taliban continuing to cooperate and allow access to the airport for those who … we’re transporting out and no disruptions to our operations,&#34; Biden said.  &#34;In addition, I’ve asked the Pentagon and the State Department for contingency plans to adjust the timetable should that become necessary.&#34;

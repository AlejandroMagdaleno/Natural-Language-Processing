Jackson County Sheriff A.J. Louderback warns of border policy&#39;s dangerous consequences on &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39;
Reports that 
illegal aliens
 are being released from custody into the United States without being tested for 
COVID-19
 are &#34;absolutely true,&#34; Jackson County, Texas Sheriff A.J. Louderback told &#34;
Tucker Carlson Tonight
&#34; Monday. 
&#34;The memo that I received this last week -- it&#39;s a defunding-ICE-by-memo -- by memorandum, sent out January 20, 2021,&#34; Louderback told host Tucker Carlson.
&#34;This is a particularly devastating document for Texans and Americans here in the United States,&#34; he added. &#34;When I read it and looked at it, it&#39;s a message to the world that you can come here illegally, you can commit crimes here against Americans, and remain illegally.&#34;
Louderback claimed that the memo was circulated by then-Acting Homeland Security Secretary David Pekoske.
ARIZONA SHERIFF TO LARA LOGAN ON IMMIGRATION: &#39;IT&#39;S OUR JOB TO FIGURE WHO THE WOLVES AND THE SHEEP ARE&#39;
&#34;We walked this path from 2008 to 2016,&#34; the sheriff said. &#34;This program that was released by memorandum is very similar to the Priority Enforcement Program in 2014 and 2015, were people were able to commit crimes against Americans. 
&#34;The COVID issue [is being] overlooked during that time. So, I struggle for a thought process, like many Americans and Texans, on how an administration can conduct themselves in this matter.&#34;

Louderback accused the federal government of &#34;promoting a lawless attitude&#34; that he said will get Americans hurt or killed.
&#34;Every peace officer in the United States should be extremely concerned about the attitude, the lawlessness, the complete abject removal of law,&#34; he said. &#34;We have a full nullification of the law going on here. We&#39;re going to allow our ICE officers, USCIS, all affected by this memo, which guts the INA and handcuffs them so that they&#39;re unable to respond. So in law enforcement here, those of us that don&#39;t have the jurisdiction to enforce the federal laws here, we&#39;ve created a situation that is unthinkable for the public.&#34;

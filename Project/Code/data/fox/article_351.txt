Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,
 bashed 
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.
, on Thursday in an apparent attempt to assign blame for the 12 flooding deaths in New York City caused by Tropical Storm Ida.
&#34;Manchin has weekly huddles w/ Exxon &amp; is one of many senators who gives lobbyists their pen to write so-called &#39;bipartisan&#39; fossil fuel bills,&#34; she said. &#34;It’s killing people. Our people. At least 12 last night. Sick of this ‘bipartisan’ corruption that masquerades as clear-eyed moderation.&#34;
She added: &#34;Fossil fuel corps &amp; dark money is destroying our democracy, country, &amp; planet. All day our community has been pulling bodies out of homes from the flood. Entire families. And we’re supposed to entertain lobbyist talking points about why we should abandon people &amp; do nothing? No.&#34;
She was responding to an op-ed in which Manchin laid out his opposition to a $3.5 trillion spending package backed by Democrats.

He also faced backlash from Rep. Rashia Tlaib, D-Mich., who told him to look into the faces of her suffering residents.
&#34;Instead of writing op-eds, why don&#39;t you look into the faces of my residents who have had their basements flooded with sewage multiple times and their power out for days, Senator Manchin. We deserve better,&#34; she said.
Manchin&#39;s office and Exxon did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.

The tweets underscored mounting tension within the Democratic Party after the Supreme Court dismissed an attempt to halt Texas&#39; restrictive abortion law. That move prompted Ocasio-Cortez and others to call for the Senate to pack the courts. 
To that end, however, they need the support of moderates like Manchin, who has already expressed his opposition.

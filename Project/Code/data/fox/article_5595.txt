Despite the pledge to continue with their work, the group&#39;s website had ceased accepting new donations. First noticed on Saturday, the link on the group&#39;s website meant to direct supporters to the donations page now leads to a message that says, &#34;Inactive. This form is no longer available.&#34; That message was still present as of Tuesday morning.
Fox News reached out to the Lincoln Project asking if there are plans to reactivate the page, but it did not immediately respond.

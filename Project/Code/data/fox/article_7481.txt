White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday laid out a timeline for when the 
White House 
would like to see movement on its $2.2 trillion spending bill – &#34;progress&#34; by Memorial Day, a bill on the president’s desk by the summer. 
&#34;We’ve got a little bit more time here,&#34; than with the American Rescue Plan, the $2 trillion COVID relief bill passed earlier this month, Psaki said. She said that bill was an &#34;emergency&#34; package. 
No Republicans have stepped forward to support the president’s bill. Asked if President Biden was committed to seeking GOP votes on the legislation, Psaki said: &#34;The president will certainly be inviting Republicans and Democrats to the Oval Office.&#34; 
&#34;There is long history of agreement on infrastructure, the need to invest, the need to take steps to be more competitive with China, we feel there are a lot of areas of agreement,&#34; she continued. 
The White House&#39;s spending breakdown of its plan, it says, includes $620 billion for roads, bridges and ports; $400 billion for elderly home care; $580 billion on job training, R&amp;D and clean energy; and $650 billion on the electric grid, broadband and water systems. 
REPUBLICANS LINE UP AGAINST $2T SPENDING BILL 
In the $620 billion for roads bridges and ports, the White House lumps in $174 billion for electric vehicles – more than it is spending on any other individual item in that category.
A number of moderate Republicans have already spoken out against the bill. 
&#34;I support improving America’s aging roads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure. And we can do so in a bipartisan way,&#34; Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said Wednesday. But, he said, Biden&#39;s plan is far too expensive and does not focus on infrastructure, as the White House is framing it.

&#34;At its core, the president’s plan calls for a $620 billion investment in transportation infrastructure. However, the total soars to $3 trillion with its inclusion of these broad policy priorities that are a far cry away from what we’ve ever defined as infrastructure,&#34; Portman said.
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who Senate Democrats cannot lose and still be able to pass a bill without GOP support, has said he won&#39;t back reconciliation unless Democrats at least try to negotiate with Republicans.

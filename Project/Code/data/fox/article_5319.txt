&#39;The Five&#39; react to the Vice President saying she will not visit the border
Vice President Kamala Harris
 on Monday issued a tough warning to potential migrants, telling them &#34;do not come&#34; to the U.S. and warning that she believed they would be turned back -- a stark contrast to a more welcoming message she had issued in past years.
&#34;I want to emphasize that the goal of our work is to help Guatemalans find hope at home, at the same time I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making the dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border -- do not come, do not come,&#34; she said in Guatemala.
FLASHBACK: HARRIS PROTESTED AT SOUTHERN BORDER IN 2018, BUT HASN&#39;T VISITED SINCE TAKING MIGRANT ROLE 
&#34;The United States will continue to enforce our laws and secure our border,&#34; she said. &#34;There are legal methods by which migration can and should occur but we, as one of our priorities, will discourage illegal migration and I believe if you come to our border you will be turned back.&#34;
The remark was in contrast to past remarks Harris had made as a presidential candidate and senator, and Republicans quickly accused her of changing tune after a migrant surge that they say was fueled by rhetoric by the new administration.

Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley pointed to a 2017 tweet of Harris&#39; when she said: &#34;Say it loud, say it clear, everyone is welcome here.&#34;
&#34;After years of telling migrants to come and bashing border security, Kamala Harris is now saying ‘do not come,’&#34; Haley tweeted Tuesday. &#34;Too little, too late: over 170,000 migrants crossed our border last month. This is a crisis and her words helped create it.&#34;
In 2019, Harris 
accused
 then-President Donald Trump of sending the military to the border as part of a &#34;grand display based on his agenda about vilifying people and building a wall&#34; and also accused him of &#34;criminalizing people, innocent people.&#34; 
HARRIS, IN GUATEMALA, TELLS POTENTIAL MIGRANTS THEY WILL BE TURNED BACK: ‘DO NOT COME’ 
At an 
MSNBC town hall
 in May 2019, Harris said the U.S. has &#34;always presented ourselves as being a nation of strength with strong arms that when people are fleeing harm, we will embrace them.&#34;
&#34;But look at what has happened with this administration. There are children who are fleeing murder capitals of the world. Let&#39;s be clear about this. Imagine, a mother who makes a decision to pay a coyote to transport her child across the entire country of Mexico, facing unknown peril, she does that because she believes for that child to stay where they are is worse,&#34; she said at the time.
&#34;But what does this president do? He virtually looks at those children and says, ‘go back to where you came from,’&#34; she said.
A month later, in June 2019, she outlined her plan for a path to permanent residency for illegal immigrants in the country, and to expand protections for potential migrants due to the U.S. status as a &#34;nation of immigrants.&#34; Critics have alleged that such promises have also incentivized migrants, who have sought to get into the U.S. so they can claim amnesty.
HARRIS TELLS GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT THAT MIGRATION IS A TOP PRIORITY, AFTER HE BLAMES US FOR SURGE
Harris pledged to &#34;immediately get to work on passing comprehensive reform with a pathway toward citizenship, but also...a plan to take executive action to immediately reinstate protection for [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] recipients and also expand those that would be allowed to actually receive DACA protection and then give Dreamers a pathway toward citizenship. Also expand protection so that we would actually defer deportation for the parents of DACA recipients, as well as siblings and spouses and [Temporary Protected Status] holders, because what we&#39;ve seen under this administration really flies in the face of what we know, which is we are a nation of immigrants.&#34;
KAMALA HARRIS&#39; MEXICO, GUATEMALA VISIT: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
On Tuesday, Harris&#39; team pushed back against claims that she has sent mixed messages on illegal migration.
&#34;The President and Vice President have been clear in dissuading people from making the dangerous and treacherous journey to the U.S./Mexico border. We encourage those who do want to come to the U.S. to do so legally and seek legal immigration options in their home countries,&#34;  Harris senior advisor Symone Sanders said in a statement.
&#34;The Vice President is committed to addressing the root causes of migration, which also addresses why migrants are coming to our border,&#34; she said.
But that message had been undercut by the Guatemalan president who, in an interview that aired Sunday, blamed what he saw as a more welcoming message to migrants by the new administration for the surge in migration.

&#34;The message changed too: ‘We’re going to reunite families, we’re going to reunite children,’&#34; he told 
CBS News
. &#34;The very next day, the coyotes were here organizing groups of children to take them to the United States.&#34;
&#34;We asked the United States government to send more of a clear message to prevent more people from leaving,&#34; he said.

The 
impeachment
 trial of former President 
Donald Trump
 in the Senate resumed on Friday with Trump&#39;s lawyers expected to argue that Democrats are hypocritical for saying that Trump incited the 
Capitol
 mob by telling his followers they have to &#34;fight&#34; against a &#34;stolen election.&#34;
During a presentation that is expected to end Friday, they played videos of Democrats who previously used charged rhetoric. One identical video was played at least twice, with some clips being played at least three times. 
Q&amp;A with senators could start this afternoon
Trump attorneys David Schoen, Bruce Castor and Michael T. van der Veen involved in presentation. 
&#34;Impeachment is &#34;an unjust and blatantly unconstitutional act of political vengeance,&#34; Trump attorney Michael T. van der Veen said. 
&#34;This is ordinary political rhetoric that is virtually indistinguishable from&#34; language used by politicians for &#34;hundreds of years,&#34; van der Veen said of Trump&#39;s language on Jan. 6. &#34;Joe Biden&#39;s campaign slogan was battle for the soul of America.&#34;
After playing the videos of a litany of Democrats using harsh rhetoric, Trump lawyer David Schoen told Democrats that they were not in the wrong with their comments. 
&#34;It&#39;s okay. You didn&#39;t do anything wrong. It&#39;s a word people use. But please stop the hypocrisy,&#34; Schoen said. 
Democrats, however, say that the context of their statements was different than Trump&#39;s Jan. 6 speech. They allege Trump primed his supporters for violence by lying about election results for months, failing to condemn actual violence in the past and telling supporters to march to the Capitol on Jan. 6
Depending on if either side calls witnesses, the trial could be on a fast-track toward a final vote. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Thursday &#34;We&#39;re hoping they -- the thing concludes by Saturday.&#34;
House impeachment managers argued on Wednesday and Thursday that Trump, with lies and aggressive rhetoric, primed his supporters to engage in post-election violence before directing them at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Trump told his supporters to &#34;fight like hell&#34; or they would not &#34;have a country anymore,&#34; the managers emphasized. 
Trump&#39;s lawyers, in addition to alleging hypocrisy, also said those comments were taken out of context. They also spent time making a case that Trump is allegedly protected by the First Amendment, citing multiple Supreme Court cases.

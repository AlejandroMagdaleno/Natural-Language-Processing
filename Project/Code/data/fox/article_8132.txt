Democratic Senate leader 
Chuck Schumer
 on Friday made an unfortunate slip of the tongue as he slammed former President Donald Trump’s conduct related to the Jan 6 Capitol riot.
Schumer was 
informing senators about the plans

It was at that point when Schumer made a somewhat phallic flub.

&#34;Make no mistake, there will be a trial and when that trial ends, senators will have to decide if they believe Donald John Trump incited the erection... insurrection against the United States,&#34; he said.
Schumer seemed to catch his gaffe and visibly winced. And, perhaps needless to say, Twitter users rose to the occasion.
&#34;Well, it WAS an uprising!&#34; Bloomberg’s Robert George quipped.
It soon became a trending topic on Twitter. Meanwhile, back home in the Empire State, the 
New York Post
 declared that Schumer’s gaffe would be &#34;hard to live down.&#34;

On more serious matters, Schumer said that articles of impeachment would be 
delivered to the Senate
 on Monday.

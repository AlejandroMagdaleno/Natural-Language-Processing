In the afternoon, Biden&#39;s pick for secretary of State, Antony Blinken, will have a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Senate Armed Services Committee will hold a hearing for Defense secretary nominee Lloyd J. Austin III.
Thursday will see the hearing for Transportation secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg before the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.

James Smith, whose wife Moira was the only female NYPD officer killed on 9/11, reacts to the left&#39;s push to defund police departments.
New top hires at the 
Democratic
 Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) have a history of promoting anti-
police
 rhetoric. 
Christale Spain, a former senior adviser of the South Carolina Democratic Party, 
expressed her excitement
 Tuesday night after 
being tapped
 as the DCCC’s senior adviser for Black engagement. In May 2020, as 
protests
 continued to rage across the country following the killing of George Floyd, Spain tweeted the definition of &#34;rebellion.&#34;
FORMER POLICE SERGEANT: BLM, &#39;DEFUND POLICE MOVEMENT&#39; REVERSED DIVERSITY TREND IN POLICE DEPARTMENTS
&#34;An act of violent or open resistance to an established government or ruler #JusticeforGeorge,&#34; she 
wrote
, seemingly endorsing the notion.
Around the same time, Spain 
applauded a tweet
 by a former Sen. Cory Booker campaign staffer who wrote that &#34;white supremacy and law enforcement&#34; in America &#34;cannot be separated.&#34;
The DCCC also hired Kristin Slevin as its chief of staff after she spent the last several election cycles working for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.
&#34;Thrilled to be joining in the righteous fight of defending our House Majority as the @dccc&#39;s new Chief of Staff. (ps - this is a damn good team),&#34; Slevin 
tweeted
 Tuesday.
In June of last year, Slevin 
encouraged
 people to keep &#34;raising hell&#34; after the Minneapolis City Council pledged to disband the city’s police department.

A day later, Slevin appeared to 
tweet her support
 for defunding the police and disbanding the military.
When reached for comment, DCCC spokesman Chris Taylor attacked news coverage of the staffers&#39; tweets. 
&#34;It’s disgusting and appalling that right-wing outlets giddily help the NRCC and Washington Republicans push racist attacks to vilify our Black - and only Black - staff, and endanger their personal safety,&#34; Taylor said. &#34;But we’re not surprised they’re hellbent on division – that’s their playbook.&#34;
The news comes after President Biden and Democratic leadership tried to distance themselves from the defund the police movement, with some 
moderates blaming the rhetoric
 for Democratic House losses in November. 
Democrats 
were ridiculed from both sides
 in July after accusing Republicans of being anti-police.

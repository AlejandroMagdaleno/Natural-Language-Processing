West Virginia senator breaks down partisan COVID relief bill on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois is waging war against the filibuster, despite warning in 2018 that abolishing the measure &#34;would be the end of the Senate&#34; as envisioned by America&#39;s Founding Fathers.
Durbin attacked the filibuster on Monday, saying the procedural measure had a &#34;death grip&#34; on the American system of governance and called for its end.
The filibuster — coming from the Dutch word for &#34;
pirate
&#34; — is a practice in the Senate where a senator maintains control of the floor by continuously standing and speaking to prevent a bill from being voted on through continuous debate.
The only way to stop a filibuster after its started is with a cloture vote, which limits the debate time on an issue but requires a 
supermajority 
of 60 votes.
&#34;The filibuster has a death grip on American democracy,&#34; Durbin wrote on Twitter Monday evening. &#34;It&#39;s time we end its power to hold the Senate hostage.&#34;
DEM SENATOR SAYS ‘OF COURSE’ SENATE SHOULD CONSIDER ENDING FILIBUSTER IF REPUBLICANS OBSTRUCT
Durbin in a speech Monday said the filibuster &#34;throws the system out of balance&#34; and gives &#34;one half of one branch&#34; of the government &#34;a monster veto&#34; over the rest. 
&#34;It promotes gridlock, not good governance,&#34; said Durbin, who then claimed that senators only have to &#34;threaten&#34; a filibuster to &#34;shut down the Senate.&#34;
The senator&#39;s stance is a sharp departure from where he stood on the filibuster just two years ago.
In a 2018 interview with 
ABC
 News, Durbin was asked about getting rid of the filibuster but took the opposite stance on the issue, saying that nixing the filibuster &#34;would be the end of the Senate&#34; as the Founding Fathers designed it to be.

The Illinois senator also said that the Senate has to &#34;acknowledge our respect&#34; for the minority party and that the Senate attempts to accomplish that through its &#34;composition&#34; and &#34;procedure.&#34;
&#34;Well, I can tell you that would be the end of the Senate as it was originally devised and created going back to our Founding Fathers,&#34; he said. &#34;We have to acknowledge our respect for the minority, and that is what the Senate tries to do in its composition and in its procedure.&#34;
The Illinois senator previously 
signaled
 in a January interview that he was &#34;of course&#34; open to abolishing the filibuster to circumvent Republican opposition.

&#34;The American people want us to take action,&#34; he said. &#34;Action on this pandemic, action on this economy … and if this filibuster has now become so common in the Senate that we can’t act, that we just sit their helpless, shame on us. Of course, we should consider a change in the rule under those circumstances.&#34;
Durbin’s office did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.

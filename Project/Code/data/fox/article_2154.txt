Randy Economy, senior adviser for Recall Gavin Newsom, calls for a debate with the California governor on the issues.
California
 Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
 on Tuesday downplayed the recall campaign against him by accusing &#34;right-wing&#34; extremist groups of being the &#34;Top 10 proponents&#34; of the recall, which is reported to have cleared 
2 million signatures
. 
Newsom&#39;s comments, which he made during an interview on &#34;The View,&#34; come as other prominent Democrats have sought to 
delegitimize
 the recall campaign.

&#34;The View&#34; host Joy Behar noted that organizers claim that more than a third of the recall signatures were from Democrats and independents, prompting Newson to claim that the &#34;chief proponent&#34; of the recall supports putting microchips into immigrants.

Newsom appeared on MSNBC’s &#34;The ReidOut&#34; on Monday night, where he pushed some of the same 
talking points
 about white supremacist groups organizing the recall.

&#34;Let me be more candid and more direct. The principal sponsor of this recall effort wants to put microchips in immigrant aliens. We have folks that are literally part of the Three Percenters militia group -- right-wing group -- that are part of the principal proponents of this effort,&#34; Newsom said.
&#34;It has a lot to do with me, it has a lot to do with everybody watching. It has to do with our values as Democrats. The RNC is the second-largest donor to this effort,&#34; he continued

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis criticizes the president&#39;s handle on foreign relations. 
A spokeswoman for 
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis
 allegedly harassed a reporter via Twitter — so the social media platform temporarily shuttered her account due to &#34;abusive behavior.&#34;
Christina Pushaw apparently disagreed with a Tuesday story from Associated Press reporter Brendan Farrington, about a multimillion dollar 
DeSantis
 donor who also invested in a company producing Regeneron, a drug used to treat 
COVID patients.

COVID-19 treatment
 in his state.
Pushaw shared Farrington’s report on her Twitter account and asked her followers to &#34;drag them&#34; before deleting the post.
The spokeswoman also threatened to put Farrington &#34;on blast&#34; if the story wasn’t changed, and retweeted a message about the AP, adding the words &#34;Light. Them. Up.&#34;
Farrington received a number of threats after Pushaw’s tweets, according to the Associated Press.

When she learned Farrington had been threatened, the spokeswoman deleted the &#34;drag them&#34; tweet, telling her followers &#34;nobody should be threatening anyone.&#34;
&#34;I’ll be fine, I hope. Freedom. Just please don’t kill me,&#34; Farrington later tweeted about the threats.

Kentucky Republican accuses the NIAID director of lying to Congress over whether he funded gain of function research
Sen. 
Rand Paul
 said he will send a letter to the Department of Justice asking for a criminal investigation of 
Dr. Anthony Fauci
. 
&#34;I will be sending a letter to Department of Justice asking for a criminal referral because he has lied to Congress. We have 
scientists that were lined up by the dozens
 to say that the research he was funding was gain-of-function,&#34; the Kentucky Republican told Sean Hannity of Fauci on Tuesday evening’s &#34;Hannity&#34; program.  
&#34;He&#39;s doing this because he has a self interest to cover his tracks and to cover his connection to Wuhan lab,&#34; Paul continued. 
FORMER SURGEON GENERAL SAYS CDC MASK GUIDANCE ‘PREMATURE’ AND ‘WRONG’
Paul’s interview comes after he and Fauci had another heated exchange during a Senate hearing Tuesday when the two traded 
accusations of &#34;lying&#34;
 over gain-of-function research at a Wuhan lab floated as the origin of the coronavirus.
The NIH and NIAID have said they supported grants to research viruses in bats but never funded gain-of-function research of coronaviruses and transmissibility for humans.   
FAUCI, RAND PAUL TRADE &#39;LYING&#39; ACCUSATIONS ABOUT GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH IN HEARING ON DELTA VARIANT
&#34;Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11, where you claimed that the NIH never funded gains-of-function research in Wuhan?&#34; Paul asked the NIAID director at one point in the hearing. The comment came after 
he cited a paper on research about bat coronaviruses
, and quoting Dr. Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University, that the &#34;research matches, indeed epitomizes the definition of gain-of-function research.&#34;
FAUCI SUPPORTS MEDICAL GROUP&#39;S CALL TO MASK 3-YEAR-OLDS ABD OLDER IN SCHOOL: ‘REASONABLE THING TO DO’
&#34;I have never lied before the Congress, and I do not retract that statement,&#34; Fauci responded. 
&#34;You do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that officially,&#34; Fauci added. 
Paul argued Fauci was &#34;dancing around&#34; the definition of gain-of-function research because he’s &#34;trying to obscure responsibility for 4 million people dying around the world from a pandemic.&#34;

Paul added in his interview with Hannity that Fauci doesn’t deserve all the &#34;blame&#34; for the pandemic, saying &#34;there&#39;s still some conjecture as to whether or not it came from the lab.&#34;
&#34;But he&#39;s lying about whether or not he funded gain-of-function research, and yes, he should be punished.&#34;
Fauci’s office did not immediately respond to Fox News’s request for comment on Paul’s intention to send a letter to the Department of Justice.

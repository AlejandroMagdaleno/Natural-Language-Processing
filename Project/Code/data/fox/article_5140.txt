FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo joins &#39;The Ingraham Angle&#39; for the latest edition of &#39;Seen &amp;amp; Unseen&#39;
President Biden
 on Monday night paid tribute to the staggering number of Americans who have lost a loved one during the 
coronavirus pandemic
 as the death toll passed 500,000.
Biden called the milestone &#34;truly grim&#34; and &#34;heartbreaking&#34; as he noted the pandemic has taken more American lives than World Warr I, World War II and the Vietnam War combined.
&#34;That’s more lives lost to this virus than any other nation on Earth,&#34; Biden said.
The president empathized with families who have suffered the loss of a loved one due to COVID-19, reminding them that there is a way through the sorrow and grief.
&#34;To those who have lost loved ones this is what I know, they’re never truly gone, they’ll always be part of your heart,&#34; Biden said. &#34;The day will come when the memory of the loved one you lost will bring a smile to your lips before a tear to your eye … my prayer for you is that [those days] will come sooner rather than later.&#34;

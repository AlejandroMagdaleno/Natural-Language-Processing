The Somali-American congresswoman and new appointee to the House Foreign Affairs Committee says she doesn&#39;t know how her comments would be offensive to Jewish Americans.
The 
White 
House
 has been silent on whether the 
Biden 
administration
 agrees with its anti-Semitism envoy nominee&#39;s previous remark deeming a comment by Rep. 
Ilhan Omar
, D-Minn., to be anti-Semitic.
In 2019, President Biden’s pick to be his administration&#39;s envoy against anti-Semitism, Deborah Lipstadt, said she believed Omar’s comments about U.S. lawmakers having an &#34;allegiance to a foreign country&#34; referred to 
Israel
 and were anti-Semitic.
&#34;I believe it is [anti-Semitic],&#34; Lipstadt said to Jewish Insider. &#34;’Dual loyalties’ is part of the textbook accusations against Jews. They are cosmopolitans, globalists, not loyal to their country or fellow citizens.&#34;
CONSERVATIVE CRITICS ACCUSE ILHAN OMAR OF NEW ANTI-SEMITIC ATTACK, THIS TIME FOCUSING ON ‘DUAL LOYALTIES’
Omar said amid the controversy that she doesn&#39;t believe her comments to be anti-Semitic, but Lipstadt 
disagreed
.
The president&#39;s nominee said at the time that Omar &#34;may think she is only criticizing Israel and its policies but one cannot ignore the fact that she is relying on traditional anti-Semitic tropes to do so.&#34;
&#34;What it suggests to me is that, at best, these people exist in a place where anti-Semitism is out in the ethosphere; they hear it, breath it in, and don’t even recognize it as anti-Semitism,&#34; Lipstadt continued.
However; when asked if the administration agreed with its nominee’s views on Omar’s comments, the White House was silent, not responding to Fox News’ request for comment.
&#34;I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country,&#34; Omar said in 2019 while onstage with fellow 
&#34;Squad&#34;
 member Rep. 
Rashida Tlaib
, D-Mich.
&#34;I want to ask why is it OK for me to talk about the influence of the 
NRA
, of fossil fuel industries, or big pharma, and not talk about a powerful lobbying movement that is influencing policy.&#34;
Omar added that she believed she has been called anti-Semitic only because she is Muslim and that her criticisms of Israel are reasonable and well-founded.

Lipstadt, a 
Holocaust
 historian and a leading figure on anti-Semitism, was formally nominated by the president on Friday to serve as his envoy in the fight against anti-Semitism.
There will likely not be much of a confirmation fight in the 
Senate
, as Lipstadt is expected to carry broad bipartisan support.

New York Democrat Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 exchanged jabs on Twitter with Texas Republican Sen. 
Ted Cruz
 Thursday over the growing immigration crisis at the U.S. southern border.
In response to a series of tweets by Ocasio-Cortez on the Democratic Party’s division in addressing migrant children crossing the border illegally, Cruz condemned the spike in undocumented migrant arrivals.
CRUZ, AOC EXCHANGE BLOWS ON ‘NAZI’ ACCUSATIONS
Ocasio-Cortez &#34;explains the real Dem position: abolish ICE. Full open borders. Which would make the [Biden border crisis] even worse,&#34; the Texas Republican wrote.
&#34;She says nothing else works. Really? Last year, we had the lowest illegal immigration IN 45 YEARS. This year, we have the highest in 20 years,&#34; he added.
Ocasio-Cortez fired back, recapping the senator’s decision to leave his 
home state
 in February, amid one of Texas’ biggest crises in years.
&#34;Ted, this is pretty rich coming from someone who fled their own home (and responsibilities) during an environmental crisis to cross the border and seek refuge in Mexico,&#34; she retorted in a tweet Thursday. &#34;Also you funded cages, expanded cages, and yet you’re complaining about cages. You have no policy, just puff.&#34;
&#34;Maybe Mexico shouldn’t let YOU in the next time you try to run away from your job to sip umbrella drinks in Cancún,&#34; she continued before adding, &#34;A reminder that your resignation is 84 days past due. At least.&#34;
AOC REBUFFS TED CRUZ TWITTER OVERTURE: &#39;YOU ALMOST HAD ME MURDERED&#39;
Thursday’s diatribe is just the latest Twitter exchange between the two political big wigs.
Ocasio-Cortez and Cruz have been firing heated tweets at one another since early January, after the New York Democrat accused the Texan of inciting the violent Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.  The attack resulted in the death of five people, and videos showing pro-Trump supporters seeking out officials like Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez were posted to social media.

Cruz has called Ocasio-Cortez a &#34;liar&#34; for her claims, and the New York Democrat in turn has rejected any calls for comradery, telling the Republican from Texas he almost had her &#34;murdered&#34;.
&#34;Happy to work w/ almost any other GOP that aren’t trying to get me killed,&#34; she said in a January tweet. &#34;In the meantime if you want to help, you can resign.&#34;

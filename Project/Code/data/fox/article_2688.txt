Sen. 
Ted Cruz
 broke with a number of other Republicans in saying that the U.S. should not boycott the 2022 Beijing 
Olympics
 to stand up to 
China’s 
abuses, but should instead &#34;kick their commie ‘a--es.’ 
The Texas Republican wrote a tweet in agreement with former President Trump, who said a boycott would be &#34;unfair to athletes.&#34;
&#34;I see it both ways,&#34; he told 
RealClearInvestigations
, &#34;but I would not do that … You go. You compete. You win.&#34;
Republicans have offered up a tough-on-China approach, fueled by China’s missteps - and alleged fault - in the COVID-19 pandemic, its human rights abuses against the Uighur minority, and unfair trade policies. 
&#34;To be clear, I and many others hope that the International Olympic Committee comes to its senses and moves the 2022 Olympic Winter Games out of Beijing,&#34; Cruz explained further in a March 
op-ed
 for Fox News. &#34;The worst thing we can do to stand up to China is to keep our athletes home. As anyone who has ever faced down a bully knows, when you decide to hide and not to fight, the bully wins. &#34;
COTTON WARNS BEIJING OLYMPICS WILL POSE CHALLENGES 
Nikki Haley, former South Carolina governor and UN ambassador under Trump, called for a boycott of the winter games until the U.S. can be certain COVID-19 didn’t come from a Wuhan lab. 
&#34;We should absolutely boycott the Chinese Olympics. Other allies and friends should do it with us,&#34; she said last month. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said she thinks world leaders should boycott the Olympics if they are held in Beijing. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., this week called for a &#34;complete boycott&#34; unless the &#34;safety, security and privacy of our athletes&#34; is guaranteed. 
POMPEO: CHINA DOES NOT DESERVE TO HOST 2022 WINTER OLYMPICS DUE TO ‘EERIE SIMILARITIES’ WITH NAZI GERMANY
Human Rights Commission co-chair Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican, opened a hearing in May by calling on the &#34;IOC and all interested parties including the United States to find a new host city — or boycott.&#34;
&#34;In granting Beijing host status for the Olympic Games, we are crowning a barbarous regime with laurels while we should be condemning their abuse and genocide,&#34; he said.

A coalition representing Uyghurs, Tibetans, residents of Hong Kong and others 
issued a statement Monday
 calling for a boycott, eschewing lesser measures that had been floated like &#34;diplomatic boycotts&#34; and further negotiations with the IOC or China. But the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee has said boycotts
 are ineffective
 and only hurt athletes.

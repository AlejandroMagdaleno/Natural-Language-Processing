Senator Joe Manchin goes against Democratic Party, Biden push for passing multi-trillion dollar spending bill without GOP support. West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner weighs in on &#39;Fox &amp;amp; Friends First.&#39;
Sen. 
Joe Manchin
, D-W.Va., on Sunday pushed back against progressive Democrats who call him a &#34;roadblock&#34; to their liberal proposals, emphasizing he is &#34;not going to be part of blowing up this Senate.&#34;
CNN&#39;s 
&#34;State of the Union&#34;
 anchor Dana Bash asked Manchin how he would respond to Democrats who say that he is one of the &#34;main roadblocks&#34; to President Biden passing his &#34;ambitious agenda,&#34; prompting Manchin to say, &#34;I&#39;m not a roadblock at all.&#34;
&#34;I am not going to be part of blowing up this Senate of ours or basically this democracy of ours or the republic that we have,&#34; Manchin said, referring to the Democratic push to eliminate the filibuster. &#34;If we have a 51-vote threshold in the Senate, the same as the House--the House wasn&#39;t designed to be partisan.&#34;
Manchin says &#39;no&#39; to ending or weakening the filibuster
&#34;The House was designed to be hot as a fire cracker. We were designed to cool it off, and that&#39;s the Founding Fathers. It was a brilliant strategy they looked at, so why can&#39;t we try to make this work?&#34; Manchin continued.

The West Virginia Senator later said there will be &#34;no consistency&#34; in the Senate if there are &#34;violent swings&#34; every time there is a party change in Congress.
Manchin penned an op-ed in The Washington Post earlier this month, 
stating
 that he will &#34;not vote to eliminate or weaken the filibuster.&#34;
&#34;The filibuster is a critical tool to protecting that input and our democratic form of government. That is why I have said it before and will say it again to remove any shred of doubt: There is no circumstance in which I will vote to eliminate or weaken the filibuster,&#34; Manchin wrote. &#34;The time has come to end these political games, and to usher a new era of bipartisanship where we find common ground on the major policy debates facing our nation.&#34;
Jim Clyburn launches scathing attack on Joe Manchin over filibuster
Top-ranking Democrat Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C. 
attacked
 Manchin earlier this month, saying it was &#34;insulting&#34; to him that Manchin would prioritize maintaining a &#34;relationship with the minority in the U.S. Senate&#34; over maintaining &#34;a relationship with the minority of voters in America.&#34;
Earlier this year, the progressive No Excuses PAC, whose leadership helped Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY., win her election in 2018, slammed Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., for supporting the filibuster, 
saying
 they &#34;stand in the way of progress&#34; and are helping &#34;shrink their own party&#39;s pandemic relief, climate, and economic investment plans.&#34;

MSNBC host Al Sharpton last month 
threatened
 to accuse Manchin and Sinema of &#34;supporting racism&#34; over their support of the filibuster.
&#34;The pressure that we are going to put on Sinema and Manchin is calling [the filibuster] racist and saying that they are, in effect, supporting racism,&#34; Sharpton told 
Politico
. &#34;Why would they be wedded to something that has those results? Their voters need to know that.&#34;
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., reportedly told Senate Republicans earlier this month to praise Manchin and Sinema for their opposition to eliminating the filibuster, Politico 
reported

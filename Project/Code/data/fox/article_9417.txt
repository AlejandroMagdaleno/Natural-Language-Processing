Fox News correspondent Alex Hogan has the latest on the border crisis on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Two top aides for Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 announced their plans to leave in the coming weeks as she readies for her first visit to the U.S.-Mexico 
border 
since being tapped to study the crisis, according to a report. 
Karly Satkowiakand and Gabrielle DeFranceschi, the director and deputy director of advance, are involved in overseeing travel and preparing selected venues for the vice president, according to The New York Times. 
A spokeswoman for the vice president reportedly said the exits had been planned and the women were finding their replacements.
The departures come as the vice president has several other important trips included for the summer after the much-anticipated border visit, which the 
White House
 announced following months of criticism by Republicans.

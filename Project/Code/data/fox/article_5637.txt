President Biden
 on Friday gave remarks on the Senate&#39;s vote to clear a nearly $2 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package without Republican support.
&#34;I&#39;m going to act. I&#39;m going to act fast. I&#39;d like to do it with the support of Republicans,&#34; Biden said during a Friday address about the state of the U.S. economy. &#34;But they are not willing to go as far as we need to go.&#34;
Biden pledged to include $1,400 stimulus checks in the coronavirus relief package.
&#34;I&#39;m not cutting the size of the checks. They&#39;re going to be $1,400. Period,&#34; he told reporters, referring to coronavirus stimulus.
&#34;I&#39;m not cutting the size of the checks. They&#39;re going to be $1,400. Period,&#34; he said. &#34;I know some in Congress think we&#39;ve already done enough to deal with the crisis. ... That&#39;s not what I see. I see enormous pain in this country.&#34;

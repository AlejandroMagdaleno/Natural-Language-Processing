A Taliban leader who reportedly helped orchestrate the group&#39;s takeover of 
Afghanistan
 was released by former President 
Barack Obama
 in exchange for former U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in 2014.
Khairullah Khairkhwa, who previously served as the Taliban’s interior minister in Afghanistan, was arrested after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 and was held at Guantanamo Bay from 2002 to 2014. Pentagon officials accused Khairkhwa of ​​being a close associate of Usama bin Laden and deemed him too dangerous to be released. 
But in 2014, he was released from Guantanamo following a prisoner swap deal under the Obama administration.

OBAMA-ERA AFGHANISTAN AMBASSADOR HAS &#39;GRAVE QUESTIONS&#39; ABOUT BIDEN&#39;S &#39;ABILITY TO LEAD&#39; US
The New York Post reported that some of the Taliban leaders pledged to fight American forces after their releases from Guantanamo Bay, but that Western diplomats eventually recognized them as official Taliban spokesmen during recent peace talks. Khairkhwa even allegedly sat across from President Biden’s envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, during negotiation talks in Moscow in March. 
&#34;I started jihad to remove foreign forces from my country and establish an Islamic government, and jihad will continue until we reach that goal through a political agreement,&#34; Khairkhwa reportedly said at the summit.

Now, Khairkhwa is being described by the Post as the &#34;mastermind of the regime change,&#34; and Taliban fighters said they were planning to bring their leaders from Qatar to Afghanistan after securing Kabul – with one of the fighters even claiming he also spent eight years in Guantanamo Bay, the newspaper said.
Biden has already reversed a Trump-era policy to release Guantanamo Bay prisoners in a bid to close the prison, releasing his first prisoner, accused terrorist 
Abdul Latif Nasser
, last month. 
Obama has not yet issued a statement on the collapse of Afghanistan, and commenting on his Instagram page was temporarily halted Monday morning after it was flooded with calls for him to do something about the takeover. 
The Office of Barack and Michelle Obama did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment on Khairkhwa&#39;s release and reports stating the former prisoner helped orchestrate the takeover.

Biden, meanwhile, 
addressed the nation on Monday
 and said he stands &#34;squarely behind&#34; his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan.
&#34;American troops cannot, and should not, be fighting in a war and dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves,&#34; Biden said, adding: &#34;Truth is, this did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated.&#34;

Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., concerned about the impact of Afghanistan troop withdrawal on national security.
The US military
 on Tuesday carried out an airstrike against terrorist militants in Somalia — the first such strike in the country since President 
Joe Biden
 took office in January.
The airstrike targeted al Shabaab fighters in the city of Galkayo, which is in the central part of the country on Africa’s east coast, Reuters reported, citing a statement from the Pentagon.
It’s unclear if anyone was killed or wounded in the strike.
Al Shabaab is linked to 
Al Qaeda
, the terrorist organization founded by Osama bin Laden, and has long tried to overthrow Somalia’s government and obtain political control in the nation.
The US frequently targets members of the organization in airstrikes, but Tuesday’s operation was the first one since Biden had been sworn into office in January.
Al Shabaab is responsible for a number of high-profile bombings and other attacks in Somalia — most recently carrying out a suicide bombing earlier this month that killed nine people in the Mogadishu, the country’s capital.

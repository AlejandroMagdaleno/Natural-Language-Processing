The governor has denied wrongdoing and has refused to resign, 
arguing he’s entitled 
to due process and that New Yorkers should await the results of an investigation overseen by state Attorney General Letitia James regarding the accusations by former staffers before making a judgment. He even claimed he’s a victim of &#34;cancel culture.&#34;
The activists disagree.
&#34;Gov. Andrew Cuomo has proven himself to be a serial predator who abuses his power, his office and the women who work for him,&#34; said Rachel O’Leary Carmona, executive director at Women’s March.
Joanne Smith, CEO of the Brooklyn-based Girls for Gender Equity, said, &#34;The time for men in power abusing, harassing and grooming women — and all people subordinate to them — is over. New Yorkers will not tolerate gender and sexual violence; it’s time for Andrew Cuomo to resign!&#34;
&#34;To the people who have survived sexual and emotional abuse from New York’s governor, know that we see you and we believe you.&#34;

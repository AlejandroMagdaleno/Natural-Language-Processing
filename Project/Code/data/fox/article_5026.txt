Ivanka Trump
 took to social media Wednesday to share that she was able to get her first shot of the coronavirus 
vaccine
, breaking her social media silence since Donald Trump left the White House in January.
&#34;Today, I got the shot!!! I hope that you do too,&#34; the former advisor to President Trump wrote on Instagram.
&#34;Thank you Nurse Torres!!!&#34; she added, captioned under a picture of herself wearing a white tee shirt and denim jeans as she received the shot.
JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON COVID-19 VACCINE PAUSE EXTENDED, CDC COMMITTEE WANTS MORE TIME TO REVIEW
Trump is the latest celeb to post a picture of herself getting the vaccine.
President Biden pledged to have 300 million Americans fully vaccinated by this summer.
Earlier this week, the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine was put on pause after the FDA and CDC launched a probe to investigate rare blood clots reported in six of the 6.8 million people that have received the latest vaccine. 
But Biden remains undeterred in his vaccination goal.
&#34;My message to the American people on the vaccine is — I told you all, I made sure we have 600 million doses of the [vaccine] — not of either Johnson &amp; Johnson or AstraZeneca,&#34; he told reporters Tuesday. &#34;So, there’s enough vaccine -- that is basically 100 percent unquestionable for every single, solitary American.&#34;

The FDA and CDC have extended the pause on the J&amp;J vaccine &#34;out of an abundance of caution&#34; but described the blood clots that appeared in six women as &#34;extremely rare.&#34;
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for the CDC said it will determine by Friday when to next meet and review the vaccine’s data.

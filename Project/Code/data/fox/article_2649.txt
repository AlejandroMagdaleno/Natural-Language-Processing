WHAT TO EXPECT FROM TRUMP&#39;S CPAC SPEECH
CPAC
 disinvited Young Pharoah from the annual conference after the American Jewish Committee denounced his past remarks and urged CPAC to condemn them. 
&#34;CPAC leadership must denounce his antisemitic conspiracy theories and act to ensure that Jew-hatred has no place at the conference,&#34; the Jewish group wrote in a 
tweet
 on Monday. 
Young Pharoah didn&#39;t immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment. 
The YouTuber was one of dozens of speakers on the agenda for the annual conference, which is a project of the American Conservative Union (ACU). The ACU didn&#39;t immediately return a request for comment. 
Former President Donald Trump is among the high-profile speakers scheduled to appear at the four-day event, the theme of which is &#34;America Uncanceled.&#34; Trump&#39;s speech will mark his 
first public appearance
 since leaving the White House.

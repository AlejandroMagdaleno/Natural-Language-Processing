Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the controversial nomination on &#39;The Story&#39;
Another 
Obama
 official is raising questions about 
President Biden&#39;s
 nominee to lead the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), 
Tracy Stone-Manning
, who is linked to a 1989 eco-terrorist plot.
Steve Ellis, who was deputy director of BLM under former President Obama, expressed his concern of what the confirmation of Stone-Manning could do to both the agency and the U.S. Forest Service.
Ellis is a near-four decade veteran of both BLM and the Forest Service. He retired from the agency in 2016.
SEN. RISCH TEARS INTO STONE-MANNING AMID TIED COMMITTEE VOTE
&#34;Much of the focus seems to be whether this is a Democrat or Republican thing, but the lens I look at this through is as a 38-year career person in both agencies, and that letter she wrote went to my Forest Service colleagues on the Clearwater,&#34; Ellis said to the 
Spokane Spokesman-Review
 last week.
&#34;The administration’s got some great initiatives and their agenda for public lands is good, but you need the career employees to implement your agenda successfully across the West,&#34; he continued. &#34;Your leader has got to be respected by career employees and across the landscape, in both blue and red states.&#34;
Ellis is the 
second
 Obama BLM official to weigh in on Stone-Manning’s nomination. Obama&#39;s first BLM Director Bob Abbey said last month that the BLM nominee’s involvement in an Earth First! tree-spiking plot &#34;should disqualify her.&#34;
Tree spiking is a dangerous and violent 
eco-terrorism
 tactic where metal rods are inserted into trees to prevent them from being cut down. The metal rods damage saws that, in turn, have severely injured people, such as a mill worker whose jaw was 
split in two
 from an exploding saw.
BIDEN LAND MANAGEMENT NOMINEE ‘COLLABORATE WITH ECO-TERRORISTS,’ TRADED TESTIMONY FOR IMMUNITY
Stone-Manning has come under fire from Senate Republicans for her involvement in the plot, with Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, repeatedly tearing into Biden’s nominee for her role.
Noting his decade-long experience on the committee, Risch eviscerated Stone-Manning’s nomination in the committee hearing on it as &#34;the most significant act of an insult to a really good agency and the people in that agency that I’ve ever seen perpetrated by this committee.&#34;
&#34;I don’t know how this nomination has got this far, but I think that we ought to spend some time looking at that,&#34; Risch said.
&#34;So, why do you put this in a tree? You put this in a tree to kill somebody,&#34; Risch asked his fellow committee members during the hearing. &#34;It’s not put in there for fun. It’s not a Sunday school prank. You put this in a tree to kill somebody.&#34;
Risch noted that tree-spiking &#34;didn’t exist&#34; while he was studying forestry, only coming around when ecoterrorism in the U.S. &#34;hit its peak,&#34; and lambasted his congressional colleagues who referred to Stone-Manning’s involvement in the tree-spiking plot as a &#34;mistake.&#34;
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee chairman John Barrasso, R-Wyo., shared the same concern as Ellis during the hearing last week, pointing to an 
E&amp;E 
News
 
report that revealed Biden’s nominee knew of the tree-spiking plot &#34;far in advance,&#34; according to the plot’s ringleader, John Blount.
&#34;This isn’t just about groups that work with the agency or even the people who enjoy our public lands, it’s about all the employees at the Bureau of Land Management,&#34; Barrasso 
said
.
&#34;How can the men and women who work at this important agency respect Tracy Stone-Manning knowing she threatened their colleagues at the U.S. Forest Service?&#34; he asked.

Stone-Manning’s nomination came to a standstill last week after the committee vote to advance her nomination split 50-50. Democrats will need a discharge petition to get Stone-Manning’s nomination through to the Senate floor for a vote.
The White House did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment on Ellis’ concerns nor Fox News’ question on if they are confident Stone-Manning will get fully confirmed by the Senate.

Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slamming rogue trip to Afghanistan by Reps. Peter Meijer, R-Mich., and Seth Moulton, D-Mass., during dangerous military evacuation from Kabul.
Some House members from both sides of the aisle were planning to head to 
Afghanistan
 despite House Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi
 and Minority Leader Kevin 
McCarthy
 urging their members not to travel to the region, Fox News has learned.
The cohort of House members, both Republicans and Democrats, either were trying to get to Afghanistan or intended to travel there to assist in the evacuation effort of American citizens and others from Kabul, multiple sources have told Fox News. 
It&#39;s believed that no additional House members were attempting Wednesday to travel to Afghanistan. However, Fox News is told some lawmakers could &#34;freelance&#34; and head there on their own in the future, despite the bipartisan admonitions. 
PELOSI SLAMS REPS. MOULTON, MEIJER FOR &#39;FREELANCE&#39; AFGHANISTAN TRIP: &#39;DEADLY SERIOUS&#39;
These travel plans came after Pelosi, D-Calif., rebuked two members of Congress – Reps. Peter Meijer, R-Mich., and Seth Moulton, D-Mass., – for taking a rogue trip to Kabul. She 
sent a letter
 to her colleagues warning against traveling to the &#34;region during this time of danger.&#34;
&#34;This is deadly serious,&#34; 
Pelosi said
 at a Capitol news conference Wednesday. &#34;You do not want members to go.&#34;
MCCARTHY SAYS BIDEN IS LEAVING US HOSTAGES FOR THE TALIBAN: &#39;HE TURNED HIS BACK ON OUR OWN CITIZENS&#39;
McCarthy also urged members of Congress to avoid Afghanistan, arguing that it could interfere with the pressing military evacuation effort. 
&#34;They shouldn&#39;t go,&#34; McCarthy, R-Calif., said Wednesday at a separate news conference. 
The statements from leadership seemed to have some effect. 
At least one member of Congress who intended to travel to Afghanistan reversed course at Pelosi&#39;s behest, Fox has learned.

The urge to travel to Afghanistan comes amid bipartisan frustration with the Biden Administration&#39;s decision to keep an Aug. 31 troop withdrawal date even though Americans and Afghans are still trying to flee the country on flights out of Kabul. The U.S. is relying on the Taliban to provide some level of safe passage to Americans to the airport where they can be evacuated.

Michigan governor&#39;s top aide vacations in Florida; reaction from state Rep. Steve Johnson.
Michigan
 Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer
 lied about not traveling out of state in a podcast interview last week, saying she was &#34;here in town the whole time.&#34;
Whitmer admitted earlier this week that she 
traveled
 to Florida in March, despite 
cautioning
 Michigan residents against traveling out of state. 
Last week, Whitmer joined the Michigan publication MIRS on their 
podcast
, where she was asked by reporter Kyle Melinn if she was able to take any days off for spring break or over the past year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Whitmer, a Democrat, responded that she was &#34;here in town the whole time&#34; during spring break and that the last trip she had taken &#34;was to Israel&#34; on official business.
WHITMER BLAMES MICHIGAN CORONAVIRUS NUMBERS ON TRAVELERS
Ted Goodman, the communications director for the Michigan Republican Party, blasted Whitmer for her travels, saying the problem wasn’t that the governor visited her dad but rather &#34;that she lied about it.&#34;
&#34;The issue is not that Gov. Whitmer visited her father, it&#39;s that she lied about it and continues to hide key facts,&#34; said Goodman. &#34;It&#39;s also hypocritical as Michiganders were denied the same opportunity through her rules that locked people from visiting their loved ones in hospitals and nursing homes.&#34;
Whitmer previously 
responded
 to criticisms of her travels to the Sunshine State, saying that she was not vacationing in Florida and was checking in on her ill father.
MICHIGAN LEADS US IN NEW CORONAVIRUS CASES AS WHITMER TAKES HEAT
&#34;It is saddening,&#34; Whitmer told The Washington Post Live. &#34;It is a two-day trip. I wasn’t partying in Miami.&#34;
&#34;It was certainly not spring break,&#34; Whitmer added.
Whitmer’s office came under fire recently after it came to light that her state Department of Health and Human Services Director Elizabeth Hertel and Whitmer’s newly minted health director traveled out of state as the governor’s administration warned against it.

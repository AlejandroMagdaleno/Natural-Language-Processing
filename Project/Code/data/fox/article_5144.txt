California Republican Party Chair Jessica Miller Patterson and Rep. Byron Donalds R-Fla., weigh in on &#39;Fox News @ Night&#39;
The Biden administration remains staunchly supportive of Budget Director pick Neera Tanden as well as working towards raising the federal minimum wage, 
White House
 press secretary 
Jen Psaki
 said on Sunday.
&#34;We remain committed to fighting our hearts out for Neera Tanden,&#34; Psaki told &#34;Fox News Sunday&#34; host Chris Wallace. &#34;We believe she is the right person — she is qualified, she is experienced — to lead the budget department. She brings a unique experience as somebody who’s lived through benefiting from a number of these programs, and she’s worked on these issues for decades across the aisle, so we&#39;re going to keep fighting for it.&#34;
Psaki made

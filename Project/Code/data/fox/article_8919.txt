Uvalde, Texas, Mayor Don McLaughlin Jr. on what he&#39;s seen firsthand of the border crisis.
The issues on the 
border
 &#34;have gotten crazy&#34; ever since the 
Biden
 administration started, a southern Texas mayor said on Wednesday. 
&#34;We went through this in 2018 and 2019. And the numbers are a cakewalk then, compared to what we&#39;re seeing now. It&#39;s gotten just totally ridiculous,&#34; Uvalde, Texas Mayor Don McLaughlin Jr. told &#34;
America’s Newsroom
.&#34; 
In Uvalde, Texas, they’re averaging 10 to 12 car chases a week, McLaughlin Jr. said, adding that he has never seen a situation like this before. 
&#34;I went to a wreck Friday night where they were pursuing a car that rolled over. There were five immigrants in it. And they were mad that they got caught and were frustrated with the officers. And this is something we&#39;re seeing every day. Our local ranchers are having their pensions cut, their houses are being broken into and they&#39;re trying to steal their cars. It&#39;s just gotten crazy,&#34; McLaughlin Jr. said.
BIDEN ADMIN CAN&#39;T KEEP UP WITH BORDER SURGE OF MIGRANT CHILDREN, CBP OFFICIAL WARNS
Migrant children are arriving at the U.S. 
southern border
 at rates faster than they can be processed and transferred to sponsor homes, all while the 
Biden
 administration has repeatedly denied that there is a &#34;crisis&#34; at the border, a senior Customs and Border Protection official told Fox News. 
&#34;We are taking in more UACs [unaccompanied alien child] than we can process,&#34; the CBP official said. &#34;I don&#39;t see how we keep this many kids when we can&#39;t find sponsors.&#34; The official spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.

The Uvalde mayor said that migrants from 49 different countries have breached their region of Texas, with the holding center in Uvalde for the Del Rio sector &#34;at capacity.&#34;
McLaughlin said that southern Texas is expected to receive 20,000 to 30,000 migrants by summer.
&#34;It’s so full, they&#39;re having to pull agents off the street and they&#39;re ending up babysitting. And our Border Patrol does a great job in our community, in our area, but their hands are becoming tied with this. And this border, it needs to be addressed. It needs to be stopped and we need to tell them to quit coming.&#34;

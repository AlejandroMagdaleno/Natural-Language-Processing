Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins got a close look at &#34;ground zero&#34; for the 
border surge
 greeting the 
Biden
 administration in its early weeks, showing viewers a crowded migrant camp just over the southern border in Matamoros, 
Mexico
.
&#34;It’s ground zero for the surge here at the border,&#34; Jenkins said Monday on &#34;
Outnumbered
.&#34;
The administration has denied the surge in 
migrant
 crossings constitutes a crisis, but the increase in asylum seekers is threatening to overwhelm border officials and overcrowd 
housing facilities
.
The 
White House
 recently 
defended
 the opening of a new child migrant holding facility that was criticized under the 
Trump
 administration. Press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration’s policy is &#34;not to expel unaccompanied children who arrive at the border.&#34;

Republican
 critics have charged the migrant surge stems from Biden&#39;s &#34;open border&#34; policies, in sharp contrast to the the Trump administration.
Jenkins also revealed 185 migrants at the Matamoros border crossing have tested positive for 
coronavirus
 in the adjacent town of Brownsville, Texas, before being released.
&#34;The migrants that were in this camp that didn’t get across, where have they gone? Well, they’ve gone throughout the city,&#34; Jenkins said. &#34;A lot of them told us they plan to cross illegally if they can’t get across the legal way.&#34;

&#34;These would-be illegal immigrants ... if they continue at this pace it will be the highest in 20 years,&#34; he said. &#34;That’s a crisis. They are being placed in Texas,

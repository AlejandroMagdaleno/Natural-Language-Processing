Business owners Ray Schnitzer and Baret Lepejian discuss the impacts of coronavirus restrictions on their restaurants. 
Nevada
 Gov. Steve Sisolak announced plans on Tuesday to fully reopen all counties within the state to 100% capacity at the start of June.
Sisolak said during a press conference that all decisions made by the state have been thoughtful and deliberative throughout the pandemic as he laid out a path to return to a &#34;more normal Nevada lifestyle&#34; by June.
&#34;As with every decision I’ve had to make throughout this pandemic, I know many people will say this is too soon, others will say it’s not soon enough,&#34; Sisolak said.
Over the past month, the governor added, daily new cases have stabilized at relatively low levels while more residents have received COVID-19 vaccines.
CDC INVESTIGATING DEATH POSSIBLY CONNECTED TO JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON VACCINE
As of May, statewide social distancing regulations will be ended and handed over to counties along without authority over other mitigation efforts, but residents will still be required to wear masks for the time being. 
Sisolak highlighted several goals, including getting Nevadans back to work and restarting conventions, which he suggested would accelerate the state&#39;s economic recovery.
Sisolak also said federal health agencies’ recommendation on Tuesday to pause injections of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine did not affect the plans.

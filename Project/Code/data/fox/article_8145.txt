Sean Hannity gives his take on the administration&#39;s next moves.
President Biden
 and the Democratic socialists are attempting to turn the U.S. on its head and destroy American values, &#34;
Hannity
&#34; host Sean Hannity said Thursday.
&#34;We are witnessing what is an unprecedented effort around the country from the radical socialist Democratic Party to fundamentally, radically transform this country,&#34; he said. &#34;[Biden’s] administration is now waging what is an all-out assault on the principles that have made this country great.&#34;
Hannity mentioned the left’s calls to pack the Supreme Court, claim statehood for Washington, D.C., and federalize future elections by omitting voter identification.

&#34;Thus increasing the opportunity for… fraud, abuse,&#34; he said. &#34;No integrity, no confidence in future elections. That will be the result.&#34;
The Democrats also intend to get rid of the legislative filibuster to avoid Republican blockage on leftist policy, a move that Hannity said would &#34;shred&#34; the Constitution. The host explained that the Democrats’ laundry list of changes isn’t about bettering American lives – it’s all about partisan power.
&#34;This is about power. Power over our elections. Power that favors them,&#34; he said. &#34;Power over our courts that favors them. … Power over state and local law. Power over your life. Power in perpetuity forever and ever.&#34;
Hannity said the end result of the Democrats’ power-hungry agenda would be the transformation of the entire country into socialist-run states like New York and California, including the high taxes, high crime and &#34;massive government corruption&#34; that come with it.

&#34;This is the dream,&#34; he said. &#34;If you like New York and you like California, buckle up. Because that’s what the United ‘Sanctuary Socialist’ States of America will look like.&#34;
&#34;If they are successful, this Democratic socialism, like every other socialist experiment before, it will fail. It will destroy … the United States of America as we know it.&#34;

Former DOJ Public Affairs Deputy Director Ian Prior breaks down the process.
Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., said she has been receiving death threats after it was suggested, she believed, that she played a role in aiding 
insurrectionists
 who laid siege on 
Capitol Hill
 last week.
Rep. Sean Maloney, D-N.Y., gave an interview to MSNBC this week confirming that a member of Congress – who supports carrying a gun in the House and had recently clashed with Capitol Police – had given a tour to potential rioters. 
Boebert, who fits both criteria, assumed Maloney was implying that she had given the tour, which she denied as &#34;categorically false&#34; in a letter to the New York Democrat.
Many members of the American public also assumed Maloney meant that Boebert had given the tour, which resulted in some dangerous consequences.
&#34;Your failure to factcheck any of these lies or even talk to me before doing an interview on a national television network has resulted in my office receiving numerous death threats and hundreds of vile phone calls and emails,&#34; Boebert’s letter read.
She called his allegations an &#34;embarrassment&#34; to the House and urged him to correct himself on record as soon as possible.
PENCE FRONT AND CENTER IN CAPITOL SIEGE AFTERMATH
Maloney countered, however, that he never mentioned Boebert&#39;s name.
During an interview with MSNBC, Maloney referenced the tour that a fellow congress member had seen given – though he did explicitly not say who gave the tour.
&#34;Some of our new colleagues, the same ones, of course, who believe in conspiracy theories and who want to carry guns in the House Chamber, who today – today – have been yelling at Capitol Police,&#34; Maloney said during the interview.
He went on to say that lawmakers find themselves in a &#34;sad reality&#34; where the &#34;enemy is within&#34; and they cannot trust one another.
&#34;But now we can’t be sure a member of Congress won’t bring a gun to the inauguration,&#34; Maloney said. &#34;We can’t be sure a member of this body wouldn’t be bringing people around the night before who the next day might have been participating in the murder of a Capitol Police officer.&#34;
When asked who the member was, he said he couldn’t be sure, but when the outlet found out that would be &#34;a real story.&#34;
Maloney also tweeted a transcript of his interview to prove that he did not bring up Boebert’s name.
After reading Maloney’s tweet, Boebert apologized for going at him – but asked him to clarify with MSNBC so that the death threats would stop.

Boebert’s name appeared in headlines this week after she had a disagreement with Capitol Police officers who wanted to check her bag after she had set off the chamber’s new metal detectors.
She referred to the metal detectors as &#34;another political stunt&#34; by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

France recalls its U.S. ambassador; Rich Edson reports from Washington on &#39;Special Report&#39;.
Gérard Araud, the former 
French ambassador
, joined leaders in Paris who expressed outrage over last week&#39;s nuclear submarine deal between

Officials in Paris lashed out at their Washington counterparts. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French foreign minister, called the deal a &#34;stab in the back.&#34; He said the &#34;brutal, unilateral and unpredictable decision&#34; reminds him of former President Trump.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken was quick to assure Paris and called them a &#34;vital partner.&#34; The AFP News Agency tweeted Blinken’s comment and Araud sarcastically responded on Thursday, &#34;We are deeply moved…&#34;
China also reacted angrily, accusing the U.S. and its English-speaking partners of embarking on a project that will destabilize the Pacific to the detriment of global security. But, the reactions from Paris and Brussels were equally severe. Both complained they were not only excluded from the deal but not consulted on it.

DES MOINES, IOWA – Republican 
Gov. Kristi Noem 
of 
South Dakota 
says she’s &#34;counting&#34; on
 former President Trump
 launching another run for the White House in 2024.
The conservative governor and strong Trump ally told Fox News on Friday that the former president &#34;had America right where we needed her. His policies were right. So I’m counting on him running.&#34;
NOEM, AT CPAC, ARGUES COUNTRY NEEDS TO ‘FIX DAMAGE’ BIDEN IS DOING
Noem spoke minutes before she addressed the 10th annual Family Leadership Summit, which is hosted by the Family Leader, a top,
 Iowa
-based social conservative organization of 
evangelicals.
Political pundits view Noem as a possible contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, especially if Trump decides against launching a White House campaign. And her stop in Iowa, the state whose caucuses for half a century have led off the presidential nominating calendar, sparked more speculation about her potential national ambitions.
WILL SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES STICK WITH TRUMP IF HE RUNS AGAIN IN 2024
&#34;It’s my neighboring state. I’m here all the time. I was just here earlier this week,&#34; she said. And pointing to Iowa’s GOP governor, Noem said &#34;Kim Reynolds asked me to come to this conference and I said absolutely, I’ll do anything for Kim.&#34;
Noem, who’s up for reelection in 2022, has become a hero to conservatives over the past year for her resistance to coronavirus pandemic restrictions. &#34;We were the only state that didn’t close a single business. We didn’t shelter in place,&#34; she said in her speech. &#34;We didn’t mandate anything. We just trusted people.&#34;

But as the number of new COVID cases across the country’s on the rise among unvaccinated Americans, the governor told Fox News &#34;we are continuing to monitor COVID hospitalizations in the state of South Dakota,&#34; but she added  that overall her state is &#34;in good shape.&#34;
POMPEO, IN IOWA, DECLARES ‘WE ARE NOT A RACIST NATION’
Asked about the reinstatement of a mask mandate in Los Angeles as the potent Delta variant continues to surge, Noem argued that &#34;putting in more mandates at this time would not be the right answer.&#34;
In her address, Noem spotlighted her social conservative credentials. &#34;I have committed to be the most pro-life governor there is,&#34; she said. &#34;I believe I’m still the only governor in the country who has a person on staff whose job description is to be an unborn child advocate.&#34;
She also said she’s &#34;putting prayer back in our schools.&#34;
The governor said the &#34;Battle Hymn of the Republic&#34; is her favorite song. &#34;We need an example in this country of people who are faithful even during challenging times,&#34; she said.
She then concluded her appearance by leading the audience in the singing of the song.

Noem also used her address – as she did a week earlier at a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Dallas, Texas – to take aim at President Biden and his Democratic administration.
&#34;Joe Biden’s America . . .  is built on hate, division, on pitting people against each other, and it is a shame to watch the violence and the crime the lack of unity,&#34; she claimed.

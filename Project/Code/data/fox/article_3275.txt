Criticizes GOP for blocking riot probe
House 
Democratic Caucus Chair
 Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., indicated Sunday his party intends to move forward with efforts to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot after Senate Republicans 
blocked consideration
 of a bill that would have established a bipartisan commission to examine the incident.
&#34;We clearly have to get to the bottom of what happened, why it happened and how we prevent something like that from ever happening again,&#34; Jeffries said during an appearance on CNN’s &#34;State of the Union.&#34; &#34;We’re going to re-evaluate what the way forward is in the next few days.&#34;
The Senate voted 54-35 on whether to open debate on the legislation, falling six votes short of the required threshold to bypass a Republican filibuster. The legislation would have established a commission like the one that was formed to investigate the Sept. 11 terror attacks, comprised of five members from each party. 
The House previously voted 252-175 to approve the bill, with 35 Republicans voting in favor of a commission. GOP lawmakers opposed to the commission argue the push for further investigation is politically motivated.

&#34;The heart of this recommendation by the Democrats is that they would like to continue to debate things that occurred in the past,&#34; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said last week. &#34;They’d like to continue to litigate the former president into the future.&#34;
Democratic leaders have yet to say how they will proceed with efforts to investigate the riot. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., could appoint a select committee to investigate without Republican support.
Jeffries said the Democratic caucus has a meeting on Tuesday to discuss the situation.
 &#34;I look forward to hearing from the speaker as well as the members as to what comes next,&#34; he added.

The pre-trial brief filed by former 
President Donald Trump&#39;s
 defense team had one extra name on it besides the two widely-reported attorneys leading his 
impeachment defense
 in the 
Senate
: Michael T. van der Veen. 
Fox News has confirmed that van der Veen will be among the presentation team in the Senate in the coming days, joining previously announced members of Trump&#39;s impeachment team, David Schoen and Bruce Castor. 
The new group of Trump lawyers comes after a team assembled by former South Carolina GOP attorney Butch Bowers quit. That was because the former president asked them to make a case repeating the former president&#39;s false claims of widespread election fraud, a source told Fox News. 
Van der Veen is the founder of the Philadelphia law firm van der Veen, O&#39;Neill, Hartshorn, and Levin. According to 
NBC Philadelphia
, Castor works for van der Veen&#39;s firm and participated in Trump&#39;s defense with his approval.

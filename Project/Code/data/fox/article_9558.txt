A 
New York City
 teenager accused of stealing a phone from an unsuspecting subway rider realized the hard way that he wasn’t fast enough to keep up with a nearby NYPD transit cop. 
In footage released by the NYPD on Friday, a teenager is seen running down a Brooklyn subway platform and flying down the stairs as a transit officer’s body camera continues to roll.

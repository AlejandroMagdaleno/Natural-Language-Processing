Co-owner of Sonoma Fit Adam Kovacs joins &#39;Fox &amp; Friends First&#39; and tells his story of how the pandemic and the governor&#39;s lockdowns hurt his business, says it&#39;s time to recall Gavin Newsom
It’s decision day in the nation’s most populous state as Californians vote in the recall election of embattled first-term Democratic 
Gov. Gavin Newsom.
 
Voters are being asked two questions on the Newsom recall ballots. The first question is whether the governor should be removed from office. If more than 50% support removing Newsom, the second question offers a list of 46 candidates running to replace the governor.

Newsom, who was overwhelmingly elected governor in 2018 in the heavily blue state of California, is facing a recall sparked last year mainly over accusations that he mishandled his state’s response to 
the coronavirus
. The effort to oust the governor was fueled by the state&#39;s strict COVID restrictions on businesses and houses of worship, school shutdowns, as well as opposition to the state&#39;s high taxes and criticism of Newsom’s handling of the state’s growing homeless population.

If the governor is recalled, the candidate who wins the most votes on the second question – regardless of whether it’s a majority or just a small plurality – would succeed Newsom.
Ballots were mailed last month to 
California’s estimated 22 million registered voters
 and need to be postmarked or handed in by the time the polls close.

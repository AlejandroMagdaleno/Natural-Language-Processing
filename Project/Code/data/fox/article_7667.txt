Texas Republican discusses the president&#39;s botched Afghanistan withdrawal on &#39;America Reports&#39;
Rep. 
Michael McCaul
, R-Texas
,
 and the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told &#34;
America Reports
&#34; Tuesday 
President Biden
&#39;s decision to leave 
Afghanistan
 by August 31st &#34;surprised everybody&#34; and is not &#34;humanly possible.&#34;
REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL: The president made this decision even though his own secretary of state [Antony Blinken] and secretary of defense [Lloyd Austin] were saying we are going to get all Americans out of there [Afghanistan] and all of our Afghan partners, there is no way it&#39;s humanly possible by August 31st. In the span of that hour and a half classified briefing the president made this decision and it&#39;s very clear it surprised everybody. That’s why I say he will have blood [on his hands] because our military always says no man left behind, no one left behind, and the president is now leaving behind American citizens. I think it&#39;s a disgrace, a betrayal, and an unconditional surrender to the Taliban [that] should never have happened. This will have long-term consequences.

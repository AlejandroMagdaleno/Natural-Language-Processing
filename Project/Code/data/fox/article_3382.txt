Rep. French Hill R-Ark., tells &#39;Fox Report&#39; that the Democratic senator&#39;s decision shows &#39;speaks to the center-right nature of West Virginia and our country&#39;
Press secretary for Senate Majority Whip Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., deleted a tweet in which she slammed 
Sen. Joe Manchin
, D-W.Va., and then preceded to lock her Twitter account. 
Jenna Valle-Riestra, who serves as press secretary for the Senate Judiciary Committee which is chaired by Sen. Durbin, appeared to take a shot, Sunday evening, at Manchin’s refusal to remove the filibuster and his opposition to Democrats voting-rights bill, S.1 For the People Act.
&#34;All I’m saying is I don’t think our founding fathers anticipated the survival of this democratic experiment to rest in the hands of a man who lives in a house boat,&#34; she tweeted. 
The tweet was quickly deleted shortly after she published it.

Fox News reached out to Valle-Riestra and Sen. Durbin&#39;s office separately for comment.
When asked about the staffer&#39;s tweet, Sen. Durbin&#39;s Communication Director Emily Hampsten responded, &#34;Senators Durbin and Manchin are friends. They’re working closely together on many important issues. Any other interpretation misreads the relationship.&#34; 
Valle-Riestra didn&#39;t respond for comment. 
The Charleston Gazette-Mail in Charleston, West Virginia published an 
op-ed 
from Manchin on Sunday in which he announced his opposition to Democrat-backed voting rights bill S.1, known as the For the People Act, and restated his opposition to eliminating the filibuster. The news was a blow to President Joe Biden and Democrats as any major legislation will need the support of 10 Republicans to overcome the filibuster.
Manchin’s announcement was met with fierce criticism from progressive lawmakers and reporters. Democratic lawmaker Rep. Mondaire Jones, N.Y., slammed the West Virginia senator and called his reasoning &#34;unsound&#34; and &#34;unserious.&#34;

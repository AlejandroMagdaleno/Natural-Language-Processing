Illinois
 Gov. 
J.B. Pritzker
 signed a Chicago firefighter pension bill into law this week that both Democratic Chicago Mayor 
Lori Lightfoot
 and Republicans in the state have called a &#34;fiscally irresponsible&#34; bill that will increase property taxes.
The new law removes an age restriction on a 3% cost-of-living increase that affects about 2,200 current and retired firefighters in the city born after 1966, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.
The governor said the law assures &#34;fair treatment,&#34; adding that he believes &#34;hardworking men and women who have earned their pension shouldn’t pay the price for local or state budget challenges.&#34;
Lightfoot had asked for the governor to veto the bill, which she said would create a &#34;deeper financial burden&#34; for Chicagoans already struggling during the pandemic.

She added that firefighters need to be &#34;appropriately compensated&#34; but stressed that an &#34;unfunded&#34; bill is the &#34;exact wrong way to accomplish this goal.&#34;
Republican House Deputy Minority Leader Tom Demmer agreed with Lightfoot that the law will make a &#34;property tax increase inevitable.&#34;
ILLINOIS DEM GOVERNOR COMMUTES SENTENCE OF CONVICTED DOUBLE MURDER DEFENDANT: REPORTS
&#34;Chicago taxpayers are on the hook for an additional $850 million thanks to Governor Pritzker signing HB2451 into law today,&#34; Demmer said in a statement.
He added that Pritzker &#34;continues his bad habit of spending hypothetical revenue&#34; by bringing up the potential sale of the James R. Thompson Center in Chicago as a way to pay for the pension increases.
Lightfoot said the bill is &#34;fiscally irresponsible and validates a Springfield practice of cutting backroom deals without full transparency and debate,&#34; agreeing with Republicans that it would add an $18-30 million financial obligation that will necessitate another property tax increase.
The legislation was introduced by state Sen. Robert Martwick, a Democrat, and passed in January.

Martwick told the 
Sun-Times
 it makes the city &#34;confront necessary, albeit really difficult, decisions about what they need to do with their finances, so that they can live up to the commitment to fund their pensions properly.&#34;

Rep. Susan Wild, D-Penn., on President Biden defending America’s exit from Afghanistan.
In what appears to be a continuation of his campaign bunker strategy, and following his widely panned interview with ABC News on the stunning fall of 
Afghanistan,
 
President Biden&#39;s
 schedule Thursday contained no planned public remarks or press briefings.  
The president took all public remarks, press briefings and press conferences off his schedule as he and his administration deal with the blowback from their botched troop withdrawal that saw Kabul fall into the hands of the Taliban.
Biden’s now-clear press schedule also comes after his much-criticized 
ABC News interview on Wednesday night
, when the president claimed there was no better way to get out of Afghanistan. Other than the ABC News interview, Biden has not taken any questions from the press this week.

&#34;President and Mrs. Trump are continually strengthened by the enduring spirit of the American people, and they look forward to staying in touch,&#34; Trump’s office said in a statement.
Trump has been outspoken on current events since his exit from the White House in January. The former president has relied primarily on press releases and television appearances for public statements after most social media platforms banned his account in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.

He has already endorsed a number of candidates and detailed plans to back primary challengers targeting his political rivals, such as GOP lawmakers who challenged his claims that the 2020 election was rigged or who expressed support for impeachment proceedings against him.

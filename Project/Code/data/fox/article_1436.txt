Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., says the solution to the border crisis is to reinstate Trump-era policies that were reversed by the Biden administration. 
President Biden
&#39;s administration is on track to admit a record low number of 
refugees
 into the 
United States
, according to a report by the International Rescue Committee.
The IRC released a study that examined the first half of the 2021 fiscal year, noting that only 2,050 refugees have been admitted.
The rate set so far would see the administration admit around 4,500 refugees this fiscal year — the lowest number by any president in U.S. history.

That number would be less than half of what the Trump administration admitted in the final year of his presidency.
The report claims
 that the Biden administration is refusing resettlement to refugees from &#34;the world&#39;s worst displacement crises.&#34;
Fox News has reached out to the White House for comment on the report.

The Story
&#34; last week.
&#34;The reversal of that policy under the Trump administration, with Biden reversing these policies, he has created a boondoggle for the traffickers, where they exploit these children,&#34; McCaul said. &#34;They separate them from their parents in Central America, and take them up this very dangerous journey.&#34;

Rep. Mike McCaul, former chair of Homeland Security committee, slams Biden over border crisis, on &#39;The Story&#39;
House Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Rep. 
Michael McCaul
, R-Texas, sounded off on Tuesday on the burgeoning 
illegal immigration
 crisis at the southern border on 
&#34;The Story&#34;
:
In fact, the secretary of homeland security said &#39;don’t come now, but you can come&#39;. This is the wrong statement; wrong message to be sending. You know, I was a federal prosecutor down there in Texas. I know the border. I chaired homeland [security]. I’ve been down there [at the border] more than any other member. I&#39;ve seen this movie before.

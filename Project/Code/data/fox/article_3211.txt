FOX News contributors Trey Gowdy, Kenneth Starr and K.T. McFarland give their thoughts on &#39;The Story&#39;
Democratic 
impeachment
 managers made the case Wednesday that the 
Jan. 6 attack
 on the Capitol was no accident but rather a &#34;premeditated&#34; and &#34;foreseeable&#34; outcome after former 
President Trump
 spread lies about election rigging, summoned a mob to Washington DC, and then incited them to &#34;fight like hell.&#34;
Impeachment prosecutors said when the attack was underway at the Capitol, forcing terrified lawmakers into the shelter, that Trump then abdicated his oath of office by failing to immediately call off the &#34;well-orchestrated&#34; mob.
&#34;He told them to fight like hell and they brought us hell that day,&#34; Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the lead impeachment manager, said in kicking off Day Two of the impeachment trial against Trump.
&#34;He did nothing to help us as commander-in-chief,&#34; Raskin added.  &#34;Instead, he served as the inciter-in-chief.&#34;
IMPEACHMENT DAY ONE RECAP: DEMS IN TRUMP TRIAL USE GRAPHIC VIDEO OF CAPITOL ATTACK
Democrats have 16 hours between Wednesday and Thursday to make their case to the Senate on why Trump should be convicted of &#34;incitement of insurrection&#34; for the Jan. 6 riot that left five people dead at the Capitol and 140 police officers wounded. Then, Trump&#39;s legal team will have 16 hours to make their case to defend the former president.

The impeachment managers were armed Wednesday with newly released Capitol security camera footage of the attack and desperate-sounding dispatch calls from police reporting officers injured in the siege needing help.
The footage showed former Vice President Mike Pence&#39;s hurried exit off the Senate floor as rioters entered the Capitol saying &#34;Hang Mike Pence.&#34; Video captured Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#39;s staff scurrying into a secure conference room where they barricaded themselves inside as rioters were heard yelling: &#34;Where are you, Nancy?&#34; 
One rioter tried to ram through the door where the Pelosi staffers were hiding. And an image of Richard Barnett, the rioter charged with breaking into Pelosi&#39;s office and putting his feet up on her desk, showed that he was armed with stun-gun walking stick.
VIDEO OF CAPITOL RIOT SHOWN AT TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL &#39;LITERALLY TOOK MY BREATH AWAY&#39;: MEGHAN MCCAIN
House impeachment managers argued Pelosi and Pence&#39;s brush with violence was made possible by one man only.
&#34;President Trump put a target on their backs and his mob broke into the Capitol to hunt them down,&#34; said Del. Stacey Plaskett, D-V.I., another impeachment manager. 
Fresh video showed Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his security detail had to run away from rioters to safety. And new details emerged of the heroics of Officer Eugene Goodman who led an angry mob away from the Senate chamber. Video showed he also helped Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah., find safety from the mob. 
DEMOCRATS PLAY PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED CAPITOL POLICE COMMUNICATIONS FROM JAN 6 RIOT
A grateful Romney said that was the first time he saw the video of Goodman&#39;s brave deed. He said the new footage of officers under attack and rioters storming the Capitol is having an effect.
&#34;Obviously [it&#39;s] very troubling to see the great violence that our Capitol Police and others are subjected to,&#34; Romney said during a recess from the trial. &#34;It tears you at your heart and brings tears to your eyes. That was overwhelmingly distressing and emotional.&#34;
Impeachment managers spent roughly seven hours Wednesday laying out a case against Trump that he premeditated the attack at the Capitol and then refused to call it off despite pleas for intervention from fellow Republicans.
Rep. Joaquin Castro said once Trump unleashed violence at the Capitol, he didn&#39;t offer military backup to the police who were overwhelmed by the insurrectionists.
&#34;On January 6th,&#34; Castro, D-Texas, said in summing up Wednesday&#39;s arguments, &#34;President Trump left everyone in this Capitol for dead.&#34;
Impeachment prosecutors said Trump knowingly courted violence, including telling the far-right group the Proud Boys to &#34;stand back and stand by&#34; and praising the &#34;patriots&#34; in Texas who tried to run a Biden campaign bus off the road. 
&#34;These are the people that President Trump cultivated who were standing by,&#34; Plaskett said. 
Trump spent months telling supporters the only way he could lose the election to President Biden was if votes were rigged. So when he sensed defeat, Trump told his supporters the &#34;big lie&#34; that the election was stolen from him, impeachment managers argued.
DEL. PLASKETT SAYS JAN. 6 RALLY DIDN&#39;T HAVE PERMIT TO MARCH TO THE CAPITOL UNTIL TRUMP STEPPED IN
Relying on Trump&#39;s tweets and statements, impeachment prosecutors sought to show a direct link between Trump&#39;s &#34;lies&#34; about the election and the escalating response by his supporters, who mobbed ballot counting centers, antagonized local election officials, and eventually descended on Washington, parroting Trump&#39;s rallying cry of &#34;Stop the Steal.&#34; 
As his legal challenges failed, Trump pledged to never surrender. Impeachment managers said since Trump ran out of &#34;non-violent options to maintain power&#34; he then sent his supporters a &#34;save the date&#34; to assemble in Washington D.C. on Jan. 6  to fight the election count in Congress.
TRUMP IMPEACHMENT LAWYER PREVIEWS DEFENSE, WILL ARGUE TRIAL IS &#39;UNCONSTITUTIONAL&#39; AND SETS A &#39;BAD PRECEDENT&#39;
&#34;This attack was provoked by the president, incited by the president,&#34; said Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo. &#34;And as a result, it was predictable, and it was foreseeable ... This mob was well-orchestrated. Their conduct was intentional. They did it all in plain sight, proudly openly and loudly, because they believed -- truly believed -- that they were doing this for him.&#34;
Democrats prosecuting the case said the impeachment charge isn&#39;t based on one Trump speech, but rather months of statements made by Trump leading up to the attack where he convinced his base they were robbed of their votes and were primed to do something to stop the certification of a &#34;stolen&#34; election. 
&#34;Instead of accepting the results or pursuing legitimate claims, he told his base more lies,&#34; said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., another impeachment manager, said. &#34;He doused the flames with kerosene.&#34;

&#34;This was a deliberate, premeditated incitement to his base to attack our Capitol, while the counting was going on,&#34; Swalwell added. &#34;And it was foreseeable, especially to President Trump, who warned us he knew what was coming.&#34;
WHAT IS TRUMP BEING ACCUSED OF IN THE SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL?
Democrats also focused on Trump&#39;s delayed response to the attack as it was underway. In his first video message to supporters, he continued to stoke grievances on election fraud and told rioters to go home, though adding: &#34;We love you. You&#39;re very special.&#34;
Impeachment managers showed quotes from Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol stating they did so because Trump ordered them to.
SENATE VOTES TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL IS CONSTITUTIONAL
Neguse said Trump alone had the power to order the mob to stand down and his failure to do so likely cost lives and injuries.
Neguse asked senators to picture the outcome if Trump had tweeted immediately &#34;STOP THE ATTACK&#34; with half as much force as he repeatedly said: &#34;STOP THE STEAL.&#34;
&#34;How many lives would we have saved?&#34; Neguse said.

Former President 
George W. Bush
 warned Tuesday that 
President Biden&#39;s
 decision to withdraw all American troops from 
Afghanistan
 by Sept. 11 could have harmful implications for women and girls if the &#34;brutal&#34; Taliban retakes power. 
Bush made the comments in a rare post-presidential interview on NBC&#39;s &#34;Today,&#34; weighing in on the war that&#39;s now lasted almost 20 years and began when he was the president. 
&#34;My first reaction was, wow, these girls are going to have real trouble with the Taliban,&#34; Bush said. &#34;A lot of gains have been made, and so I&#39;m deeply concerned about the plight of women and girls in that country.&#34;
He added: &#34;I think the administration hopes that the girls are going be OK through diplomacy. We&#39;ll find out. All I know is the Taliban, when they had the run of the place, they were brutal.&#34;
SULLIVAN PROMISES BIDEN &#39;NOT GOING TO TAKE HIS EYE OFF THE BALL&#39; WITH AFGHANISTAN, DESPITE GOP CONCERNS
Biden&#39;s move to take out all American troops technically extended a previous deadline for May 1 set by former President Trump. But it also amounted to a commitment from the new president to end the long-running war when there were some doubts about whether he would do so. 
The decision was lauded by Democrats, who said it was long overdue. 
&#34;[A]fter sinking two decades of blood and treasure into wars in the Middle East, it is time to bring our troops home,&#34; Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. &#34;America does not need to fight forever wars.&#34;
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., meanwhile, said the move would put the shaky Afghan government at risk and help the Taliban. 
&#34;Apparently, we&#39;re to help our adversaries ring in the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks by gift-wrapping the country and handing it right back to them,&#34; McConnell said.

BIDEN ADMIN TO BRIEF FULL SENATE ON DECISION TO WITHDRAW US TROOPS FROM AFGHANISTAN
&#34;The Taliban is likely to make gains on the battlefield and the Afghan government will struggle to hold the Taliban at bay,&#34; McConnell added, quoting an assessment by the Biden administration&#39;s intelligence community. 
Bush Tuesday reflected that the war his administration first oversaw is potentially drawing to a close. 
&#34;Time flies,&#34; he said. 
Bush in his &#34;Today&#34; interview also spoke about the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, saying it made him &#34;ill,&#34; and asked people to have faith that a fair trial is being conducted in the Derek Chauvin case.

He also oversaw a naturalization ceremony for new Americans, as he promoted his new book that consists of paintings of immigrants and the stories of how they&#39;ve contributed to the United States. 
Bush said he wants American immigration policy to make it easier for people to enter legally through &#34;border enforcement with a compassionate touch.&#34;
&#34;You can&#39;t have a country that has open borders,&#34; he added.

Former Michigan U.S. Senate candidate discusses effects of school closings on &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39;
School closures
 due to the 
coronavirus
 pandemic are going to &#34;set an entire generation back,&#34; former Michigan U.S. Senate candidate John James warned on &#34;
Fox News Primetime
&#34; Thursday.
&#34;I believe that right now this is not a matter of Democrat or Republican,&#34; James told host Katie Pavlich. &#34;It&#39;s a matter of policies that work and policies that don&#39;t. It’s a matter of what is best for our children and what is not.&#34;
The Republican insisted that &#34;what is best for our children, according to the CDC and according to science, is in-person education.&#34;
&#34;Right now, we are in a situation where truancy is at an all-time high, the achievement is at an all-time low. And if you can&#39;t read, you can&#39;t work,&#34; James added.
CALIFORNIA BOARD MEMBER COMPARES REOPENING SCHOOLS TO &#39;WHITE SUPREMACIST IDEOLOGY&#39; AND &#39;SLAVERY&#39;
What makes the closures even more harmful, James argued, is the fact that poor, disabled and minority children are most affected by them.
&#34;Some of the people making these decisions still have Black Lives Matter yard signs on their lawn, and they&#39;re perpetuating the most racially divided educational system since the Jim Crow era all over the country,&#34; he said. &#34;This is something that is is a basic civil right that&#39;s being violated, not just of Black children, of all children, but Black children are disproportionately negatively affected.
&#34;Make no mistake, our education system was far from perfect before the pandemic in places like Detroit,&#34; he added. &#34;The literacy level was far below, far below the national average. In fact, our state had to settle with former students who believe and I agree, that literacy is a basic civil right. I believe that a quality education means a basic civil right and anyone who stands in the way of that should be held accountable.&#34;

James argued that &#34;safely and sensibly opening is the Democrat version of &#39;repeal and replace [ObamaCare]&#39;.&#34;
&#34;When you hear that from officials, they have no plan, and they have no plan because they&#39;re afraid of being wrong and they&#39;re afraid of being wrong because they care more about getting re-elected than they care about our children&#39;s futures,&#34; he explained. &#34;That&#39;s wrong. They should be accountable.&#34;

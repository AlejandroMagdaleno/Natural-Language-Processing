A top 
Chinese
 diplomat accused the United States of creating an &#34;imaginary enemy&#34; during another tense meeting between representatives from Beijing and the

In a readout release Monday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China stated that &#34;some Americans portray China as an ‘imagined enemy.’&#34;

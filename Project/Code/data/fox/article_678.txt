FOX News White House correspondent Kristin Fisher has the details on &#39;Special Report&#39;
White House press secretary Jen Psaki has refused to describe the surge of unaccompanied migrant children at the US-Mexico border as a &#34;crisis,&#34; but she repeatedly used that label when talking about issues during former President Donald Trump&#39;s administration. 
As 
arrests
 of migrant children illegally crossing the border have steadily climbed under President Biden&#39;s administration, Psaki has repeatedly declined to address the situation as a 
&#34;crisis.&#34;
But Psaki has described other issues that way. 
The White House press secretary referred to climate change as a &#34;crisis&#34; in a past tweet criticizing former Trump on the subject.
SURGE OF 13,000 CENTRAL AMERICAN MINORS EXPECTED AT BORDER
 
&#34;Its not just [COVID-19]...where [Trump] has ignored experts and science...it’s true for the climate crisis too,&#34; Psaki wrote in May of last year.
Psaki also called gun violence a &#34;crisis&#34; in August 2019, thanking the gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety for &#34;putting some [cash] behind ads holding Republicans accountable who won&#39;t support&#34; legislation for background checks and controversial red-flag laws.
A couple of weeks later, the White House press secretary called gun violence a &#34;crisis&#34; again and asked former Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke in a tweet to &#34;take guns,&#34; saying &#34;no one needs an assault weapon&#34; in 2019.
Additionally, Psaki referred to the presidency of Biden’s predecessor, Trump, as an &#34;existential crisis&#34; in a 2020 tweet when talking about money from grassroots campaigns in comparison to the money from &#34;liberal billionaires.&#34;
Psaki did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment.

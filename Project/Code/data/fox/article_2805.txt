Governor Andrew Cuomo not contemplating making changes to indoor dining bans. &#39;Fox &amp;amp; Friends First&#39; New York City business panel reacts.
New York
 Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 and New York City Mayor 
Bill de Blasio
 agree that indoor dining will not return to the city anytime soon, citing a continuous surge in COVID-19 cases.
Cuomo said during a Monday press conference that while he plans to ease some New York COVID-19 restrictions starting Wednesday, &#34;the indoor dining in New York City is a New York City-specific condition&#34; and the state is &#34;not at this point contemplating any changes&#34; to the ban.

&#34;Bundle up. Stay warm out there,&#34; he said.
Asked when New York City will resume indoor dining, he said he wants &#34;to see indoor dining reopen when it&#39;s safe.&#34;

The city is reporting about a

 COVID-19 positivity rate with 36,067 total new cases reported within the last week.
&#34;We&#39;re obviously the biggest city in the country. An incredibly densely packed place. We were the epicenter of this crisis,&#34; de Blasio said. &#34;We lost tens of thousands of New Yorkers. We&#39;re going to be really careful and smart about when we let people get back together in close proximity with their masks off because they&#39;re eating and drinking.&#34;

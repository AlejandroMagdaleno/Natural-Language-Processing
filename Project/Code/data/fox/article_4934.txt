 said Friday on 
&#34;America’s Newsroom&#34;
 that the second impeachment of President 
Trump

They respect institutional norms.

Why weren’t they doing that for the last four years? We know the answer. The answer is because now they have got rid of Donald Trump, they also have successfully silenced Donald Trump. They are just kicking him as he is on his way out the door with great glee. The purpose of that is they want to demoralize Trump supporters and conservatives and silence them before they then embark over the next two years in their radical policy program.

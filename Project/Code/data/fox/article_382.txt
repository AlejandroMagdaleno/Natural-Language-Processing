Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blasts critical race theory opponents as uninterested in combating racism during a CNN interview.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y., said she raised over $300,000 for 
abortion
 rights groups in 
Texas
 following the state&#39;s new law banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.
Democrats
 are blasting the Texas Heartbeat Act, or 
S.B. 8
, signed by Republican 
Gov. Greg Abbott
 in May, which prohibits all abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, usually around six weeks, and also gives individuals the right to sue abortion clinics or those who help women get abortions in the state. The Supreme Court ruled last week in a 5-4 decision that the law could remain in effect. 
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ MOCKED FOR USING TERM &#39;MENSTRUATING PERSON&#39; TO DESCRIBE WOMEN IN INTERVIEW
Since Sept. 1, Ocasio-Cortez’s email and social media campaigns highlighting the issue have brought in $300,000 in donations for organizations &#34;providing much needed resources to folks seeking abortion care in Texas,&#34; her campaign team announced in a 
press release
 Friday.
The release said fundraising had &#34;spiked&#34; after Sarah Palin’s 
Fox News interview
, in which Palin slammed Ocasio-Cortez for 
referring to women
 as &#34;menstruating&#34; people.
Ocasio-Cortez had 
tweeted
 Wednesday: &#34;The gutting of Roe v Wade imperils every menstruating person in the US, every person who engages in sex, and every person who values our constitutional right to privacy. Just one reason Roe isn’t a &#34;women’s issue&#34; beyond the fact that people who aren’t women can menstruate too!&#34;
Palin ripped the self-described democratic socialist as a &#34;fake feminist&#34; over the comment.
&#34;She’s milking the whole female thing, and as a real feminist, I’m embarrassed for her,&#34; 
Palin said
 Wednesday.

Ocasio-Cortez responded to Palin with a 
video
 Thursday sarcastically advising the former Alaska governor to call the hotline &#34;1-800-CRY-NOW.&#34; The congresswoman later 
announced
 she set up a 
website
 of the same name that acts as a donation page to abortion providers.
Ocasio-Cortez’s team said donations poured in from 4,000 individuals and will be allocated to multiple abortion rights groups, including Texas Equal Access Fund and Whole Woman&#39;s Health Alliance, Inc.

Loudoun County, Virginia, teacher resigned in emotional address calling out &#39;politicized agendas&#39; being taught to children.
California
 Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
 has signed into law Friday afternoon a bill requiring students to take ethnic studies classes in order to graduate. Critics contend the controversial bill opens the door to teaching critical race theory in the classroom. 
&#34;This bill would add the completion of a one-semester course in ethnic studies, meeting specified requirements, to the graduation requirements commencing with pupils graduating in the 2029–30 school year, including for pupils enrolled in a charter school,&#34; The bill, known as A.B. 101 states. &#34;The bill would expressly authorize local educational agencies, including charter schools, to require a full-year course in ethnic studies at their discretion.&#34;

One of the bill&#39;s authors, Democrat Assembly Member Jose Medina, 
said
 the bill is necessary in public schools.
&#34;The inclusion of ethnic studies in the high school curriculum is long overdue,&#34; Medina said. &#34;Students cannot have a full understanding of the history of our state and nation without the inclusion of the contributions and struggles of Native Americans, African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans.&#34;

The bill was opposed by the Los Angeles Times editorial board, which argued it provided too much flexibility to the schools. Thousands in the Southern California Jewish community opposed the bills because they deemed previous versions to be antisemitic.
Others have 
accused
 the bill of opening the door for critical race theory, the controversial curriculum showing up in schools across the country that contends the United States is systemically racist.

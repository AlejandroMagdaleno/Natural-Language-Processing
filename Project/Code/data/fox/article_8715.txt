14 people killed in Chicago over the weekend; &#39;America&#39;s Newsroom&#39; reports
Sen. 
Ted Cruz
, R-Texas, excoriated &#34;
Squad
&#34; member Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., on Monday for &#34;divisive lies&#34; in response to her controversial tweet over the weekend that claimed the United States is &#34;stolen land&#34; and Black Americans are not &#34;free.&#34; 
The Texas Republican tore into the progressive Democrat&#39;s widely panned tweet, torching it as being full of hate and telling Americans to start believing people on the left when they say they hate the country.
&#34;Hateful, divisive lies,&#34; Cruz wrote on Monday. &#34;The Left hates America. Believe them when they tell you this.&#34;
DEMOCRAT CORI BUSH SLAMS THE FOURTH OF JULY, CLAIMS ‘BLACK PEOPLE STILL AREN’T FREE’
Cruz pointed out that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick &#34;tried to spread the same lies on July 4&#34; two years ago and shared a link to an article from July 2019 highlighting his tweets pushing back against Kaepernick at that time.
Bush turned heads on Sunday when she claimed in a post about Independence Day that Black people in America &#34;still aren&#39;t free&#34; and that the U.S. is &#34;stolen land.&#34;
&#34;When they say that the 4th of July is about American freedom, remember this: the freedom they’re referring to is for white people,&#34; the lawmaker 
wrote
. &#34;This land is stolen land and Black people still aren’t free.&#34;
The Missouri Democrat was joined by a chorus of progressives who agreed with Bush’s claims, including congressional candidate Shahid Buttar, who praised Bush and wrote in his own tweet that it is &#34;almost as if our entire country has been brainwashed to ignore our history – and how its worst elements continue today – despite our self-congratulatory rhetoric.&#34;

Also joining Bush and Buttar was former MSNBC anchor Toure, who 
tweeted
 &#34;F--k Independence Day&#34; and claimed &#34;the whole reason the Colonies wanted independence was because Britain was moving toward abolishing slavery.&#34;
Actress Alyssa Milano also posted a TikTok video claiming that the &#34;United States was founded on the unjust treatment of Native Americans, Africans and other people of color.&#34;

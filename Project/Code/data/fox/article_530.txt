Republican
 Study Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on Wednesday introduced new 
legislation
 to sanction a 
Chinese
 government-backed &#34;disinformation network.&#34;
The Countering Chinese Propaganda Act, which takes recommendations from the Republican Study 
Committee&#39;s National Security Strategy
, would implement sanctions on the 
United Front Work Department
 (UFWD) -- an arm of the Chinese Communist Pary that helps coordinate information campaigns.
&#34;The United Front participated directly in the Uyghur genocide and the oppression of Christians in China—but its ultimate goal is to spread those persecutory tactics around the globe,&#34; Banks said in a statement. &#34;The leadership in Washington may have changed, but China’s political warfare hasn&#39;t.&#34;

He added that the job of combating Chinese Communist Party disinformation has &#34;fallen&#34; into the hands of Congress.
CHINA STATE-OWNED MEDIA USES TIME SQUARE VIDEO SCREENS FOR ADS 
A 2018 staff research report from the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission notes that UFDW-related organizations, while they do not have a direct connection to the CCP, play &#34;an increasingly important role in China’s broader foreign policy&#34; under Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
Xi had established two new UFWD bureaus at the time the research was published, one of which targeted &#34;representatives of the &#39;New Social Classes,&#39;&#34; which aims to gather &#34;support from China&#39;s new middle class,&#34; and the second of which &#34;cultivates loyalty and suppresses separatism in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of western China, home to the Uyghur ethnic group and other Muslim minorities.&#34;
AT&amp;T ACCUSED OF LOBBYING AGAINST SANCTIONS ON CHINESE STATE-OWNED TELECOM COMPANY
Banks and Cotton&#39;s new legislation would create new sanctions for state-backed propaganda networks and require the secretary of state to determine whether the UFWD would qualify as an entity to be sanctioned. 
&#34;The Chinese Communist Party expands its disinformation campaign each day–concealing information regarding the origin of COVID-19, lying about its oppression of [Uyghurs] and other religious minorities, and infiltrating American universities and businesses,&#34; Cotton said in a statement.
He added that the UFWD &#34;is just another venue for the CCP to spread its propaganda and to coopt foreign groups to toe the CCP line.&#34;

President Biden
 has yet to follow the previous administration&#39;s and the Canadian parliament&#39;s respective decisions to label China&#39;s reported

US COMPETING IN 2022 BEIJING OLYMPICS &#39;WRONG SIGNAL TO SEND&#39; AMID CHINA&#39;S MUSLIM UYGHUR GENOCIDE, NY REP SAYS
Up to 
3 million
 Uyghurs in Xinjiang have been subject to mistreatment, including relocation to what China has dubbed reeducation camps but what 
fomer detainees
 and foreign policy 
experts
 have recognized as prison camps aimed at secularizing that religious sector of China&#39;s population, since at least 2017.
Former Defense Secretary Mike Pompeo in December issued visa restrictions against UFWD officials who engaged &#34;in malign activities to co-opt and coerce those who oppose Beijing’s policies,&#34; he said in a 
tweet
 at the time, adding that the Trump administration was calling on China &#34;to end its use of coercion to suppress freedom of expression.&#34;

The troops were deployed to Washington, D.C., after the Capitol riots and before the inauguration. Jennifer Griffin reports.&lt;br&gt;
Republican Sen. Rob Portman is urging 
President Trump
 to &#34;explicitly&#34; tell his supporters to &#34;remain peaceful and refrain from violence&#34; in the runup to President-elect Joe Biden&#39;s inauguration as lawmakers grow increasingly concerned about the 
potential for another riot
 like the one at the Capitol last week. 
OFFICIALS RAMP UP CAPITOL SECURITY AHEAD OF BIDEN INAUGURATION AMID THREATS OF ARMED PROTESTS
&#34;If our nation experiences additional violence and destruction at the hands of his supporters in Washington, D.C., and state capitols around the country, and he does not directly and unambiguously speak out now when threats are known, he will bear responsibility,&#34; Portman, R.-Ohio, said in a 
statement
 Tuesday. 
Portman made the statement a week after a Trump rally on Jan. 6 where the president urged his supporters to &#34;fight&#34; for the &#34;stolen election&#34; after which a mob of them stormed the Capitol, forcing lawmakers into hiding. 
&#34;Both in his words before the attack on the Capitol and in his actions afterward,&#34; Trump &#34;bears some responsibility for what happens,&#34; Portman said.
Five people, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer, died in the unprecedented attack.
Trump on Tuesday defended his language and his response to the attacks, calling it &#34;totally appropriate.&#34;

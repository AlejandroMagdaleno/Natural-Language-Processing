Rep. James Comer says he has little confidence the Biden administration can get every American out of Afghanistan before the deadline. 
FIRST ON FOX: 
Republicans
 on the House Oversight Committee are slamming 
President Biden
 over his recent &#34;political&#34; firings of 
Trump 
administration
 
officials who were appointed to military academies’ advisory boards.
Fox News exclusively obtained a letter from House Oversight Committee ranking member James Comer, R-Ky., to Office of Presidential Personnel Director Catherine Russell regarding the president’s demand for 18 military panel appointees from his predecessor’s administration to resign in the middle of their terms.
Comer led a number of his Republican committee colleagues on the letter to Russell, who pointed out that the firings &#34;came in the wake of President Biden’s bungled Afghanistan withdrawal&#34; and therefore have been overlooked by the media.

&#34;Board members refusing to resign were considered fired at 6 p.m. that same day,&#34; the lawmakers wrote. &#34;We are unaware of any such action taken by a prior president or administration.&#34;
&#34;In light of these unprecedented and possibly unlawful political firings, we request information to understand the process and legal basis behind these decisions,&#34; they also wrote.
The Republican lawmakers pointed out that Biden is &#34;undermining&#34; the American military’s &#34;foundational pillars&#34; by &#34;summarily firing the presidentially-appointed board members.&#34;
&#34;With these firings, President Biden continues a pattern of political gamesmanship to purge Trump appointees from the government,&#34; the letter reads. &#34;In this case, the firings are not only unprecedented but potentially a violation of law.&#34;

According to the letter, the legality of the firings is &#34;both uncertain and untested,&#34; as military panel appointees serve three-year terms that are extended until a successor is appointed, and blasted the firings as &#34;yet another example of the Biden administration’s mismanagement of and disregard for our armed forces.&#34;
&#34;The decision, combined with the other firings, shows disrespect to our service academy graduates,&#34; the lawmakers wrote. &#34;This illustrates the nonsense of the stated rationale for the dismissals.&#34;
The lawmakers ended the letter by demanding the Biden administration turn over all &#34;documents and communications&#34; related to the firings.
Biden came under fire after it was revealed he had asked the panel appointees to resign during their three-year terms.
&#34;I&#39;m not resigning, but you should,&#34; Kellyanne Conway, a member of the Board of Visitors to the U.S. Air Force Academy and a former senior adviser to Trump, 
wrote in a response
 to Biden following the demand.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki defended the president&#39;s move earlier this month, saying the decision was &#34;to ensure [the president] has nominees and people serving on these boards who are qualified to serve on them and who are aligned with [his] values.&#34;
Psaki also denied that the moves were politically motivated, saying instead that &#34;the president’s qualification requirements are not your party registration, they are whether you’re qualified to serve and whether you’re aligned with the values of this administration.&#34;
The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

A 
Black Lives Matter
 activist has been arrested for allegedly participating in the defacement of a statue of 
former President Lincoln
 in Idaho during Black History Month.
On Tuesday, the city of Boise said it had charged 37-year-old Terry Wilson with Injuring Monuments, Ornaments, and Public Improvements. Police initially responded on Feb. 1 to a report of vandalism at the bronze statue of Seated Lincoln in Julia Davis Park, which saw paint, feces and signs that were cleaned by parks and recreation crews. The statue was also 
reportedly wrapped
 in a &#34;Black Lives Matter&#34; flag.
An Instagram account bearing the name of one of the co-organizers, Peaceful Roots of Change, posted a photo of the defaced statue and criticized Lincoln for his role in permitting the execution of 38 Native Americans in 1862.

The city reported no damage was done to the statue but the defacement provoked criticism from Mayor Lauren McLean, who emphasized that vandalism was a crime. &#34;Vandalism is a crime, never appropriate, and those committing these crimes will be held accountable,&#34; McLeaan said at the time.
Boise police said additional arrests are expected and they were able to identify suspects using physical and electronic evidence.
Police said Wilson ran when they approached him on Tuesday but they were able to stop him and take him into custody. 
&#34;Wilson was found to be in possession of a firearm, marijuana and drug paraphernalia,&#34; a release

&#34;Wilson was taken to the hospital and was medically cleared before being booked into the Ada County Jail on the listed charges,&#34; the police&#39;s notice read.
The 37-year-old is being represented by the National Lawyer’s Guild and maintaining his innocence.
&#34;I was with my kids and my family, and they are now seeking mental health support because of what happened,&#34; he reportedly said. &#34;I am innocent and I plan to contest these charges,&#34; he said in reference to vandalism and resisting arrest.
Wilson has been described by The Idaho Statesman as a Boise Black Lives Matter spokesman who has a history of activism. The 
ISJ
 reported Wilson is a former adjunct professor for Boise State University and was personally acquainted with one of his arresting officers, who was also a student in the college&#39;s criminal justice program.
In a statement to Fox News, Mike Sharp, Boise State director of media relations, said, &#34;Mr. Wilson is no longer an employee of nor is he enrolled in classes at Boise State.&#34;
An Instagram account appearing to belong to Wilson also includes a link to the Boise chapter of the organization, which helped organize the original demonstration.

Senate 
Republicans
 are slamming what they call the &#34;pricey partisan pet projects&#34; and &#34;Democratic wish list items&#34; embedded in the House&#39;s relief package put forth by the Biden administration, saying that &#34;most of the $1.9 trillion&#34; within the legislation has &#34;absolutely nothing to do&#34; with the pandemic.

 passed the 
coronavirus
 relief bill on a mostly

Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, argues the migrant caravan of thousands is a &#39;microcosm of what&#39;s coming&#39; once Joe Biden becomes president. 
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
, on Tuesday warned that the 
U.S. border
 will be &#34;overrun&#34; unless the incoming Biden administration sends a message to the incoming 
migrant caravans
 that they support 
President Donald Trump’s
 policies on immigration. 
&#34;If the 
Biden Administration
 does not immediately send a clear and unmistakable signal that they support the tough policies implemented by President Trump,&#34; Graham tweeted, &#34;it will be just a matter of time before our border is overrun again.&#34; 
Graham’s warning comes just one day before Biden will be 
inaugurated
 as the nation’s 46th president. In the past week, a migrant caravan formed in 
Honduras
 began making its way to the U.S.-
Mexico
 border. 
A migrant within the group was interviewed over the weekend saying people like him were motivated to make the journey to the U.S. on the belief that Biden’s administration will implement more favorable immigration policies than his predecessor.

The migrant also referenced Biden’s promise on the campaign trail that he would suspend deportations for 100 days after taking office.
By Tuesday, the caravan had largely dissipated after it 
entered Guatemala
 and was met by security forces. Small groups pressed on toward the Mexican border, while others accepted rides from authorities back to Honduras.
ASYLUM SEEKERS CALL ON BIDEN TO REVERSE TRUMP IMMIGRATION POLICIES, PROTECT &#39;VULNERABLE&#39; POPULATIONS
During a recent interview with Univision&#39;s Ilia Calderón, Vice President-elect 
Kamala Harris
 gave a 
preview
 of the incoming administration’s immigration plan. 
Harris said the administration plans to create &#34;great efficiencies&#34; to streamline the naturalization process, including decreasing the amount of time required to acquire U.S. citizenship from 13 years to eight years, offering certain members of the Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Action for Childhood programs automatic green cards and adding immigration judges to help eliminate backlogs on court hearings. 
&#34;We believe it is smarter and a more humane way of approaching immigration for immigrants,&#34; Harris said.

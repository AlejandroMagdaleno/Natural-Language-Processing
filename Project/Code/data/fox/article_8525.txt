The U.S. State Department 
was criticized Sunday over a tweet that tied the historic protests that broke out in Cuba to COVID-19 concerns in the country where people have been
 living under communism for decades.
Julie Chung, the acting assistant secretary for the department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, posted, &#34;Peaceful protests are growing in Cuba as the Cuban people exercise their right to peaceful assembly to express concern about rising COVID case/deaths &amp; medicine shortage. We commend the numerous efforts of the Cuban people mobilizing donations to help neighbors.&#34;
SOCIALIST SANDERS MUM ON PROTESTS
Chung’s Twitter bio says that tweets from her are signed with a &#34;JC.&#34; The tweet in question did not carry her initials. The State Department did not immediately respond to Fox News for clarification.
Reports out of the country said protesters chanted &#34;Freedom,&#34; &#34;Enough,&#34; and &#34;We Want Liberty.&#34; Critics say the COVID-19 crisis seems to be on the periphery of the country’s discontent.
Cuba is going through its worst economic crisis in decades, along with a resurgence of coronavirus cases, as it suffers the consequences of U.S. sanctions imposed by the Trump administration.
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., called the tweet from the State Department &#34;ridiculous.&#34;

&#34;People in Cuba are protesting 62 years of socialism, lies, tyranny &amp; misery not &#34;expressing concern about rising COVID cases/deaths,&#34; he tweeted. &#34;Why is it so hard for @potus &amp; the people in his administration to say that?&#34;
Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, attached the Chung tweet to his post stating that the U.S. &#34;supports freedom of expression and assembly across Cuba, and would strongly condemn any violence or targeting of peaceful protesters who are exercising their universal right.&#34;

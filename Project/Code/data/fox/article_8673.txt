Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst says the Biden administration believes the job is done in Afghanistan, Senate will demand answers from Milley and Austin
Mullah Nooruddin Turabi, a founder of the Taliban who will control prisons under the new government in 
Afghanistan
, said strict punishment, including amputations and executions, will return.
&#34;Everyone criticized us for the punishments in the stadium, but we have never said anything about their laws and their punishments,&#34; Turabi said in Kabul during an interview, which was published Thursday by the Associated Press. &#34;No one will tell us what our laws should be. We will follow Islam, and we will make our laws on the Quran.&#34;
CHRISTIANS, RELIGIOUS MINORITIES IN AFGHANISTAN NOW FACE GREATER DANGER UNDER TALIBAN RULE
Under the Taliban&#39;s previous rule of Afghanistan, Turabi served as justice minister and head of the so-called Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, a position the Associated Press stated was &#34;the religious police.&#34; During that time, amputations and executions were carried out for criminal offenses, including theft and highway robbery.
According to Turabi, those same practices will be brought back. 
&#34;Cutting off of hands is very necessary for security,&#34; Turabi said, claiming it was a deterrent to theft and other crime.

While it has yet to be determined whether the punishment will occur in public, Turabi said that Taliban officials are working to &#34;develop a policy&#34; to handle it and insisted the Taliban &#34;are changed from the past,&#34; as he spoke with a female reporter.
In addition to announcing that severe punishments would return, Turabi, said the Taliban would allow television, mobile phones, photos and videos &#34;because this is the necessity of the people, and we are serious about it.&#34; He also noted that female judges would be allowed to adjudicate cases. However, Afghanistan’s laws will be based on the Quran.
Turabi even claimed it would help spread the Taliban&#39;s message. 
&#34;Now we know instead of reaching just hundreds, we can reach millions,&#34; he said, adding that if executions and amputations are approved for public viewing, then people could record those instances and share them as a deterrent for what Taliban officials consider criminal offenses.

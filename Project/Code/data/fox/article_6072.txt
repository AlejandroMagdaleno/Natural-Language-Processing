Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, GOP take issue with proposed rule from the Education Department; Chad Pergram reports.
Senate Minority Leader 
Mitch McConnell
 and fellow Republicans are demanding 
President Biden
&#39;s Education Department block a planned history education proposal that invokes the 
1619 Project
.
McConnell penned a letter to Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona with more than 30 of his GOP colleagues blasting new 
proposed priorities
 for American history and civics teaching as &#34;divisive nonsense.&#34;
&#34;Americans do not need or want their tax dollars diverted from promoting the principles that unite our nation toward promoting radical ideologies meant to divide us,&#34; McConnell wrote. 
TRUMP REBUTS NY TIMES &#39;1619 PROJECT&#39; WITH &#39;1776 REPORT&#39; URGING SCHOOLS TO REJECT &#39;IDEOLOGICAL POISON
The Education Department 
published the new proposal
 on April 19 for federal grant guidelines designed to promote more &#34;culturally responsive teaching and learning&#34; at K-12 schools. As positive examples, the Department of Education cites the &#34;landmark&#34; 1619 Project, the resources of the Smithsonian&#39;s National Museum of African American History and &#34;anti-racist practices&#34; modeled by scholar Ibram X. Kendi.
The 1619 Project was a Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times Magazine enterprise that examined the long-term consequences of slavery in America. It was released in 2019 to coincide with the 400th anniversary of the first arrival of enslaved Africans in colonial Virginia in 1619. Certain historians 
have raised concerns
 with some of the claims, namely that slavery was a primary reason that colonists fought the American Revolution.

Some conservatives have panned the work as an attempt to rewrite history and balked at the 1619 Project curriculum being taught in schools. To counter the 1619 Project, former President Trump formed a &#34;1776 Commission&#34; that issued a report meant to support what Trump called &#34;patriotic education.&#34;
Shortly after taking office, Biden disbanded that commission that his team said: &#34;sought to erase America&#39;s history of racial injustice&#34; and 
removed the 1776 report
 from the White House website.
BIDEN TO RESCIND TRUMP&#39;S &#39;1776 COMMISSION&#39;
McConnell&#39;s letter to Cardona stresses broad concerns that schools are diving into culture wars to the detriment of teaching students factual history and civics lessons.
McConnell and his GOP colleagues lamented that Americans aren&#39;t proficient in basic civics, such as naming the three branches of the federal government. Instead, certain schools and, now the federal government, are trying to inject &#34;divisive, radical and historically-dubious&#34; propaganda into the classrooms, the senators wrote. 
&#34;Taxpayer-supported programs should emphasize the shared civic virtues that bring us together, not push radical agendas that tear us apart,&#34; they wrote.

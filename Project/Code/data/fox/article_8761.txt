It was not immediately known how long Sununu would remain hospitalized.
Sununu, a Republican, had said Wednesday he tested negative for COVID-19, hours after his office said he wasn’t feeling well, postponed a meeting and began isolating.
&#34;I woke up with symptoms similar to COVID and out of an abundance of caution I took two rapid antigen tests, which came back negative, and then followed up with a PCR test, which confirmed the negative,&#34; Sununu had said. &#34;I am going to rest up, and look forward to getting back to the State House soon!&#34;
Sununu, 46, is fully vaccinated against COVID-19. He received the single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on April 10.

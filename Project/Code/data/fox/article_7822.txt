Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane argues President Xi Jinping &#39;fundamentally believes that his autocratic capitalism&#39; will &#39;win out over democratic capitalism.&#39; 
Republican
 lawmakers fired back after the 
Chinese Communist Party’s
 (CCP) state-owned media mocked the wave of violence America experienced over Independence Day weekend.
Xinhua News Service, a Chinese state media outlet, attacked the surge of violence over the Fourth of July weekend in a crass political cartoon of a man firing guns over a grave marked &#34;Death From Firearm&#34; as what appears to be two politicians celebrate the holiday.
&#34;How a gun-happy nation spends its #FourthofJuly weekend,&#34; the state media outlet captioned the picture.
BLOODY JULY FOURTH WEEKEND LEAVES 150 FATALLY SHOT IN MORE THAN 400 SHOOTINGS NATIONWIDE
In a Tuesday email to Fox News, House Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Michael McCaul, R-Texas, eviscerated the post as showing everyone &#34;just how crass and violent the Chinese Communist Party is that they have their propaganda outlets celebrating the deaths of 450 Americans over the July 4th holiday.&#34;
&#34;The CCP is currently committing genocide against ethnic and religious minorities in their country and are brutally cracking down on peaceful protesters in Hong Kong who are simply crying out for freedom,&#34; McCaul said.
&#34;Until they stop murdering and imprisoning their own people, I don’t believe anyone in the world should look to them for moral advice,&#34; he added.
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also torched the CCP, saying there was no way the Chinese government could lie their way to changing the facts about their regime.
CHINA EXPANDS INFLUENCE AS IT WARNS NATIONS OF ‘BROKEN HEADS’ IF THEY INTERVENE
&#34;No amount of propaganda can change the fact that the Chinese Communist Party is a murderous, genocidal regime that fears freedom, undermines democracy, destroys cultures, and betrays its people,&#34; Rubio told Fox News in a Tuesday email.
Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas told Fox News in a Tuesday statement that it is &#34;increasingly difficult to distinguish Chinese Communist Party propaganda from the progressive left’s anti-American incitement.&#34;
The state media outlet was not the only Chinese government mouthpiece to mock the tragedies that have befallen the U.S. in the past weeks.
Li Yang, a consul general for the Chinese government in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 
openly 
mocked
 
the victims of the condo collapse in Surfside, Florida, in multiple tweets as the tragedy unfolded.
&#34;American-style rescue: very layman in saving people, but too expert in blasting!!!&#34; Li 
wrote
 
on Monday, including pictures of the condo collapse.
&#34;‘America is coming back!’&#34; the CCP diplomat wrote in a tweet from July 2. &#34;But none of the people buried in the ruins has come back!!!&#34;

Kentucky Republican joins &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39; to discuss his objection to the &#39;unconstitutional&#39; Trump impeachment.
Senators were sworn in as jurors for former 
President Trump’s impeachment trial
 Tuesday as the Senate voted 55-45 to end debate on Sen. 
Rand Paul’s
 point of order arguing that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional now that Trump is out of office. 
Five GOP senators voted not to dismiss the impeachment trial of President Trump: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mitt Romney of Utah. They voted with all 50 Democrat senators to table the point of order. 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has indicated he has an open mind on whether Trump should be convicted, voted against ending debate.

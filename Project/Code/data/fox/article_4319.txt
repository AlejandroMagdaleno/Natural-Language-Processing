Republican-led states are gearing up to sue the 
Biden
 administration over the president’s &#34;unconstitutional&#34; mandate requiring businesses with more than 100 employees enforce 
vaccinations
. 
&#34;The American Dream has turned into a nightmare under President Biden and the radical Democrats,&#34; Republican South Carolina Gov. 
Henry McMaster
 said on Twitter. &#34;They have declared war against capitalism, thumbed their noses at the Constitution, and empowered our enemies abroad.&#34;
&#34;Rest assured, we will fight them to the gates of hell to protect the liberty and livelihood of every South Carolinian,&#34; he added. 
BIDEN TO ANNOUNCE VACCINE MANDATE FOR COMPANIES WITH MORE THAN 100 EMPLOYEES
The message comes after President Biden ordered a sweeping mandate on Thursday requiring all businesses with more than 100 workers to get vaccinated or test for the virus on a weekly basis. The mandate affects about 80 million Americans. 
About 17 million workers at health facilities who receive federal Medicare or Medicaid will also be required to get vaccinated. 
&#34;We’ve been patient. But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us,&#34; Biden said in remarks Thursday, adding that the unvaccinated &#34;can cause a lot of damage, and they are.&#34;
McMaster is far from alone in saying he will fight the mandate, with South Dakota Gov.

BIDEN DECLARES SWEEPING NEW VACCINE MANDATE: ‘THIS IS NOT ABOUT FREEDOM’
&#34;Biden’s vaccine mandate is an assault on private businesses. I issued an Executive Order protecting Texans’ right to choose whether they get the COVID vaccine &amp; added it to the special session agenda,&#34; 
Abbott tweeted
 on Thursday evening. &#34;Texas is already working to halt this power grab.&#34;
CALIFORNIA PROFESSOR SUES OVER VACCINE MANDATE, SAYS HE HAS NATURAL IMMUNITY
While Noem 
warned the president
: &#34;@JoeBiden see you in court.&#34;  
Mississippi Gov. 
Tate Reeves
, Alaska Gov. 
Mike Dunleavy
, Arkansas Gov. 
Asa Hutchinson
, Alabama Gov. 
Kay Ivey
, Utah Gov. 
Spencer J. Cox
, Iowa Gov. 
Kim Reynolds
, Idaho Gov. 
Brad Little
 also issued messages denouncing the mandate as government overreach, while Gov. 
Ron DeSantis 
slammed the mandate ahead of Biden&#39;s remarks. 
Biden also targeted both DeSantis and Abbott for their coronavirus responses during his speech, saying he would use his &#34;power as president to get them out of the way.&#34;
DeSantis has not responded to the attack, but his press secretary told Fox News that &#34;the constant stream of insults from the White House&#34; is to &#34;distract&#34; from the administration’s &#34;abject failures.&#34; 
REPUBLICANS EXPLODE WITH FURY OVER BIDEN VACCINE MANDATE: &#39;ABSOLUTELY UNCONSTITUTIONAL&#39;
&#34;Governor DeSantis is focused on working for Floridians. The constant stream of insults and threats from the White House is a desperate attempt to regain control of the Narrative and distract from the Biden Administration’s abject failures: Afghanistan, the border crisis, and the COVID-19 response,&#34; Christina Pushaw told Fox News on Friday. 
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee joined the chorus of Republicans vowing to sue over the vaccine mandate. 
&#34;Joe Biden told Americans when he was elected that he would not impose vaccine mandates. He lied. Now small businesses, workers, and families across the country will pay the price,&#34; RNC chair Ronna McDaniel said.

&#34;Like many Americans, I am pro-vaccine and anti-mandate,&#34; she said. &#34;Many small businesses and workers do not have the money or legal resources to fight Biden&#39;s unconstitutional actions and authoritarian decrees, but when his decree goes into effect, the RNC will sue the administration to protect Americans and their liberties.&#34;
Biden addressed the governors&#39; intentions to resist the mandate on Friday during a visit to a school in Washington, D.C., saying he was &#34;disappointed&#34; by the state leaders. 
&#34;I am so disappointed,&#34; Biden said. &#34;Particularly, some Republican governors have been so cavalier, with the health of these kids, so cavalier with the health of our communities.&#34;

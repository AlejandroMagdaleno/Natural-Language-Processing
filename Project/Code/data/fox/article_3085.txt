Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman on the spike in anti-Semitic attacks nationwide .
A 
Democratic
 
congressman from 
Minnesota
 
has called out the progressive wing of his party for what he says is their &#34;deafening&#34; silence on the rising 
anti-Semitic
 attacks in America.
Rep. Dean Phillips, whose district covers the western suburbs of the Twin Cities including Bloomington, Eden Prairie and Edina, put his progressive colleagues on notice in a Monday tweet. The two-term congressman eviscerated the progressives for not putting as much gusto behind condemning anti-Semitism as they have other progressive priorities.
RASHIDA TLAIB ALLY, FORMER SANDERS SURROGATE: ‘STOP CONDEMNING ANTI-SEMITISM’
 
&#34;I&#39;ll say the quiet part out loud; it&#39;s time for ‘progressives’ to start condemning anti-semitism and violent attacks on Jewish people with the same intention and vigor demonstrated in other areas of activism,&#34; Phillips tweeted.
&#34;The silence has been deafening,&#34; the native of St. Paul, Minnesota added.
Phillips&#39; criticism comes amid a 
spike in anti-Semitic attacks
 in the U.S. following flaring tensions between Israel and Palestinian Authority-backed terror group Hamas sparked from rocket attacks launched indiscriminately at Jerusalem by the terror group.
&#34;Conservatives call out violence in all forms and on all sides, those on the far left remain silent until political expediency loosens their lips,&#34; freshman Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., told Fox News on Monday.
&#34;We must denounce anti-Semitism at every opportunity,&#34; the first-term congressman added. &#34;There is no place intolerant political thought for those who tout the endorsements of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood abroad, but remain silent on anti-Semitic violence at home.&#34;
‘SQUAD’ DEMS CONDEMN ANTI-SEMITISM AMID BROADSIDES AGAINST ISRAEL ‘APARTHEID’ STATE SOME SAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE
Members of the &#34;Squad&#34; — the group of progressive Democrats led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. — spoke out against the rising tide of anti-Semitism in the U.S. over the weekend, though some critics suggested that the lawmakers bear responsibility for inflaming anti-Jewish sentiments. 
The lawmakers were torched by users online, who brought up the &#34;Squad&#34; members’ previous tweets that had referred to Israel as an &#34;Apartheid&#34; state and accused the Middle Eastern democracy of engaging in ethnic cleansing.
&#34;While anti-Zionist gangs beat up Jews in her city, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was providing a quasi-intellectual basis for their actions, defaming Israel as an apartheid state employing indiscriminate force in what she seems to think is a capricious quest to murder as many Palestinian children as possible, instead of a highly restrained military operation tightly targeted on terrorists,&#34; The American Jewish Committee global director of young leadership Seffi Kogen wrote.

Kogen added that Ocasio-Cortez &#34;didn&#39;t call for violence, but she carved out an area of respectability for a certain type of anti-Semitism, and others were only too happy to rush in, fists flying.&#34;
Ocasio-Cortez and several members of the small, unofficial caucus spoke out against anti-Semitism outright while others, such as Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., mentioned anti-Semitism alongside Islamophobia or couching statements against anti-Semitism with critiques against Israel.

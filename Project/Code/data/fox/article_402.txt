Creator of the fundraiser, Matt Walsh, speaks out on &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39; after the congresswoman rejected his offer to help 
If the grandmother of U.S. Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 has suffered in 
Puerto Rico
 since Hurricane Maria in 2017, then Puerto Rican politicians are to blame, not former 
President Trump
.
That’s the assessment of an aunt of the New York Democrat, who was interviewed in Puerto Rico by Britain’s Daily Mail.
Ocasio-Cortez made headlines earlier this month after posting photos from the Puerto Rico home of her 81-year-old grandmother, or &#34;abuela,&#34; Clotilde Rivera, and claiming that the residence remained in disrepair, nearly four years after the hurricane, in part because &#34;Trump blocked relief $ for PR.&#34;
But when a Daily Mail reporter visited Rivera’s home this week, a woman there who claimed to be AOC’s aunt said the congresswoman’s story wasn’t accurate. 
The aunt noted that the Category 5 hurricane caused extensive damage to the island – but insisted Trump wasn’t to blame for residents struggling to receive aid.

&#34;It’s a problem here in Puerto Rico with the administration and the distribution of help,&#34; the aunt 
told the Daily Mail
. &#34;It is not a problem with Washington. We had the assistance and it didn’t get to the people.&#34;

After Ocasio-Cortez’s June 2 posts on Twitter, conservative commentator Matt Walsh fired back at the congresswoman, saying it was &#34;Shameful that you live in luxury while allowing your own grandmother to suffer in these squalid conditions.&#34;
Walsh later raised more than $100,000 for Ocasio-Cortez’s grandmother until the online campaign was ended – but the congresswoman’s family declined to accept the assistance.

      Conservative commentator Matt Walsh raised cash for the grandmother of U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after the New York Democrat posted photos of squalid conditions inside the grandmother&#39;s Puerto Rico home.
      
In her June 2 Twitter thread, Ocasio-Cortez claimed the Trump administration &#34;had a major role&#34; in preventing many Puerto Ricans from receiving hurricane relief funds. But she added that much of the problem was &#34;systemic,&#34; and also blamed &#34;La Junta,&#34; the island’s fiscal control board, as well as local leaders.
The end result, she claimed, has been &#34;policies that pushed out local families.&#34;

Ocasio-Cortez then called for audits of how relief funding was being distributed – and assured her Twitter followers that Rivera was &#34;doing okay&#34; despite what the photos of her home seemed to suggest.
&#34;She had a place to go to and be cared for,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez wrote, then asked, &#34;what about the thousands of people who don’t?&#34;
Hurricane Maria damaged 90 percent of Puerto Rico’s 1.3 million residences and left nearly 3,000 people dead, the Daily Mail reported.

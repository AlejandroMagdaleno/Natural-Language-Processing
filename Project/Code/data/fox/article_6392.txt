Pentagon press secretary John Kirby joins &#39;Your World&#39; to address National Guard presence in DC and COVID vaccine distribution
The price tag for keeping the 
National Guard
 in 
Washington D.C.
 since Jan. 6 has reached an estimated $438 million, a senior defense official told Fox News.
The estimate came as the nation came close to a month since the riots that left rocked the U.S. Capitol. Chief Pentagon spokesman John Kirby recently said that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had committed to ordering all units to &#34;stand down&#34; in the next 60 days.
Between 5,000 to 7,000 troops are staying in D.C. until mid-March, a significant reduction from the 26,000 that were deployed to help secure the inauguration.
A spokesman previously 
confirmed
 to Fox News that the D.C. National Guard would &#34;remain on orders until March 31, 2021.&#34;
ONGOING CAPITOL TROOP PRESENCE SPARKS QUESTIONS
Acting Army Secretary John E. Whitley 
said
 at the end of last month that the Guard had received requests for follow-on assistance from the U.S. Secret Service and other law enforcement entities in D.C.
&#34;National Guard members will be postured to meet the requirements of the supported civil authorities up to and including protective equipment and arming if necessary,&#34; Whitley said at the time.

The continued presence of the Guard has provoked criticism from some.
&#34;The lesson of the Capitol riot is not that we should quarter a standing army at the Capitol just in case, but rather that our security measures should be calibrated to the actual threats,&#34; Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., 
said
 at the end of last month.

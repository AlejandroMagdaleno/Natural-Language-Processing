Democrat Ron Kim accuses the governor&#39;s top aides of intentionally covering up nursing home death numbers on &#39;The Story&#39;
An aide implicated in embattled New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s nursing home scandal taught an &#34;ethics in government&#34; class at the New York University School of Law.
Linda Lacewell, superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, was one of several Cuomo aides who reportedly 
altered
 nursing home data to undercount coronavirus deaths — a charge the administration 
denies
.
Lacewell is an &#34;adjunct professor at NYU Law, teaching ethics in government,&#34; according to her 
official government biography
. 
Cuomo&#39;s office did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment regarding the apparent contradiction between Lacewell&#39;s teaching experience and her alleged actions.
Attorney Kevin Bell revealed that Lacewell was his ethics professor in law school on Twitter Friday following news of her alleged involvement. 
&#34;Y&#39;all this was my law school ETHICS PROFESSOR,&#34; he wrote. &#34;HER CLASS WAS CALLED ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS.&#34;

The United States is donating millions of doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine to the 
African Union
, the White House said Thursday.
The 17 million doses will arrive in the coming weeks. These are in addition to the 50 million doses already sent to the 55-member continental union.

The doses will &#34;help close the vaccine equity gap,&#34; the White House said in a statement.
The African Union, whose states comprise more than 1.3 billion people, has 
alleged
 that manufacturers are not giving its member states adequate access to vaccines. Only 2% of the approximately 5.7 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines given to people around the world have been in Africa.
The Biden administration has dispatched tens of millions of vaccine doses to other countries through the World Health Organization&#39;s COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX), which is a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.
Biden mentioned the donation during a bilateral press conference with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta in the Oval Office on Thursday.

&#34;We&#39;re continuing our shared fight against COVID,&#34; said Biden. &#34;The United States has donated 2.8 million doses of vaccine to Kenya as part of a 50 million doses we&#39;ve donated to the African Union.
&#34;And I&#39;m proud to announce that today that we&#39;re making an additional, historic one-time donation of 17 more million doses of J&amp;J vaccine to the AU, and we&#39;re going to be sending some more of it by the end of the year to Kenya.&#34;

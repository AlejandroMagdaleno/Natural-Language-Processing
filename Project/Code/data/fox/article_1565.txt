President Biden stumbled twice and appeared to trip while going up the stairs to Air Force One on Friday.
President Biden
 stumbled twice and fell as he scaled the stairs to 
Air Force
 One on Friday at 
Joint Base Andrews
. 
The president was briskly climbing the stairs to the presidential jet before appearing to trip, attempting to gather himself, then tripping again. A reporter in the pool following Biden reported that it’s a windy day at Andrews.
The White House said that Biden &#34;is doing 100% fine&#34; after his fall. 
From one camera angle, Biden&#39;s entire torso went out of view when he stumbled the second time, though his hand can be seen still holding onto the railing of the jet stairs. Biden then got up and made it the rest of the way up the jet stairs.

Another video angle shows that Biden was down on his knee for a moment, before getting up and pausing briefly with one hand on the railing and the other rubbing his knee. 
White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield elaborated on Biden&#39;s condition. 
&#34;I know folks have seen that President Biden slipped on his way up the stairs to AF1, but I’m happy to report that he is just fine and did not even require any attention from the medical team who travels with him,&#34; she said. &#34;Nothing more than a misstep on the stairs.&#34;
A White House spokesperson later blamed the wind for Biden&#39;s fall, according to the New York Post.

Top American leaders have a history of struggling with the stairs used to board the aircraft meant to carry them around the world and keep them safe from attack.

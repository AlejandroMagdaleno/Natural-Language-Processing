U.S. congressional candidate Rep. Claudia Tenney believes once &#39;all legal votes&#39; are counted she will emerge victorious.
New York Republican candidate 
Claudia Tenney
’s lead over the state&#39;s incumbent increased to 122 votes after more than 300 votes were found that were attributed to an error by county election officials, a report said. 
The Post-Standard
 reported 
that Oneida County election officials had been reviewing ballots and determined that 393 of the votes were registered on time and legitimate. Of those ballots, 232 went to Rep. Anthony Brindisi. Oswego County News Now 
reported 
that the ballot count could be completed by Monday.
The contest between Brindisi, the Democrat incumbent, and Tenney is the only race in the country that has not yet been certified. The seat representing New York’s 22nd Congressional District is empty. The candidates have sparred in court over disputed affidavit and absentee ballots cast in their district in central New York.

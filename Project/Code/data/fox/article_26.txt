Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, along with 16 other state attorneys general, penned a 
letter
 to 
President Biden
 and U.S. Attorney General 
Merrick Garland
 demanding the federal government cease efforts to intimidate parents into silence at school board meetings.
&#34;Your recent action seeks to chill lawful dissent by parents voiced during local school board meetings by characterizing them as unlawful and threatening,&#34; the attorneys general wrote in the letter, led by Rokita.
US COMMISSION ON CIVIL RIGHTS MEMBERS BLAST AG GARLAND FOR MEMO ON PARENTS PROTESTING SCHOOL BOARDS
A 
memorandum
 issued by Garland, which was released shortly after the National School Boards Association (NSBA) sent a letter to Biden claiming some clashes between school boards and parents may amount to &#34;domestic terrorism,&#34; calls for the FBI to take the lead on a task force to address threats against 
school
 officials, including creating a centralized way to report such threats. 
Discussing the memo, the 17 chief law enforcement officers from each state argued that it is &#34;based upon a flawed premise&#34; and violates &#34;First Amendment rights of parents to address school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff on educational matters by seeking to criminalize lawful dissent and intimidate parents into silence.&#34;
In addition to its claim of an increase in the &#34;acts of malice, violence and threats against public school officials,&#34; the NSBA letter also called for the Biden administration to 
invoke
 the Patriot Act, which Congress passed to deal with terrorism in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. 
The attorneys general slammed the ideas promulgated in the letter from the NSBA, claiming the association failed to &#34;document a single legitimate instance of violence.&#34;

&#34;To be sure, anyone who attacks or threatens violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, or staff should be prosecuted,&#34; the attorneys general wrote. &#34;However, in its letter demanding action, the NSBA fails to document a single legitimate instance of violence. And even if it did, there are sufficient criminal and civil remedies already available in all 50 states and territories.&#34;
The top law enforcement officers from each of the 17 states also concluded that &#34;the NSBA seems more concerned about suppressing speech with which it disagrees than real threats of violence&#34; and that a &#34;physical assault on a school administrator, board member, teacher, or staff is just that, a criminal assault and will be addressed under state law.&#34;
&#34;Hoosier parents have a First Amendment right to speak their minds to teachers, administrators and school board members,&#34; Rokita said in a 
statement
 on the matter. &#34;That’s why I’m demanding that the Biden administration immediately stop attempting to shut down parental participation through scare tactics and intimidation.&#34;

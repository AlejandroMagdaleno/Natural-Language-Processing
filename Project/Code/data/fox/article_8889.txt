Texas 
Gov. Greg Abbott
 signed the state&#39;s controversial election integrity bill Tuesday after a months-long battle with Democrats opposed to the legislation.
Abbott 
traveled to Tyler
, Texas on Tuesday to 
sign SB 1
, an election security bill that will set new rules for mail-in voting while increasing the number of partisan poll watchers and giving the state more control of local voting operations.
Abbott&#39;s signature comes after a 
long battle with Democrats
 who opposed the legislation, which included some lawmakers fleeing the state in a desperate attempt to block the law from being passed.
TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT TO CALL &#39;SPECIAL SESSION AFTER SPECIAL SESSION&#39; TO MAKE FLEEING DEMS CONSIDER VOTING BILL
Those efforts came to an end last week after the 
Texas
 House passed the bill 80-41, with the Texas Senate voting 19-13 in favor of the new law. Both votes were almost completely along party lines.
The governor signaled his intention to sign the legislation shortly after it passed in the legislature.
&#34;Senate Bill 1 will solidify trust and confidence in the outcome of our elections by making it easier to vote and harder to cheat. I look forward to signing Senate Bill 1 into law, ensuring election integrity in Texas,&#34; Abbott said in a statement.
HERE&#39;S WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN THE TEXAS ELECTION BILLS DEMOCRATS KEEP COMPARING TO JIM CROW
Republicans have argued the bill is a necessary step to put a stop to voter fraud in the state and boost voter confidence in the integrity of elections.
&#34;How much fraud is OK? None. How much suppression is okay? None,&#34; said GOP state Sen. Bryan Hughes of the legislation. &#34;That&#39;s why Senate Bill 1 makes it easy to vote and hard to cheat.&#34;

But Democrats claim that there is no evidence to support the notion that widespread voter fraud is a problem in the state.
&#34;I worry that this bill is going to take our state down a very dangerous slippery slope. And I think that this narrative is dangerous, this narrative that there&#39;s widespread fraud with no evidence. I think it&#39;s damaging to our democracy,&#34; Democratic state Sen. Cesar Blanco argued.

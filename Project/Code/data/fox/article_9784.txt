President Joe Biden&#39;s
 Education Secretary is reportedly investigating the administration&#39;s legal authority to cancel some of the $1.7 trillion student loan debt, but the 
White House
 says the President still does not support debt relief above $10,000 for all borrowers.
&#34;The President does not favor $50,000 in student loan relief without limitation,&#34; a White House spokesperson told Fox News Thursday. 
Any debt relief above $10,000 would have to be targeted, &#34;based on the borrower’s income, based on the kind of debt in question,&#34; the White House said.

White House chief of staff 
Ron Klain told Politico
 Thursday that Education Secretary Miguel Cardona is preparing a report for the President on his legal authority to cancel student debt. 
&#34;He asked his Secretary of 
Education
, who’s just been on the job a few weeks, once he got on the job to have his department prepare a memo on the President’s legal authority, and hopefully we’ll see that in the next few weeks,&#34; Klain told Politico. &#34;And then he’ll look at that legal authority, he’ll look at the policy issues around that, and he’ll make a decision.&#34;
The President campaigned on canceling up to $10,000 in student debt per borrower, but the progressive wing of the 
Democratic Party
 is calling on him to cancel up to $50,000. 
&#34;We’re all here to call on President Biden to do right by the movement that elected him and to use his executive authority to cancel $50,000 in federal student loan debt,&#34; Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., said at a news conference Thursday.

Sen. 
Elizabeth Warren
, D-Mass., argues that the Education Secretary has legal authority to cancel student loan debt under a section of the 1965 Higher Education Act that 
states the secretary
 can modify, &#34;... compromise, waive, or release any right, title, claim, lien, or demand, however acquired, including any equity or any right of redemption.&#34;
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that Biden wants to work with 
Congress
 on the issue. 
&#34;The President continues to call on Congress to cancel $10,000 in debt for student loan borrowers,&#34; she said at a briefing. &#34;That’s something Congress could take an action on and he’d be happy to sign. We’re still taking a closer look at our options on student loans.&#34;

The Education Department also announced this week that the pause on federal student loan payments will be extended to more than 1 million private borrowers who have defaulted on their loans. 
Student loan debt ballooned to

 nationwide at the end of 2020, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee&#39;s new senior advisor for strategic outreach referred to 
police officers
 as &#34;white supremacists&#34; after the storming of the Capitol in January and condoned looting in the wake of the death of 
George Floyd
.
Dyjuan Tatro made the comments before he 
joined
 the DCCC in early February.
&#34;The answer to white supremacists storming the Capitol is not to give more money to a different group of white supremacists who&#39;s [sic] job it is to uphold white supremacy,&#34; Tatro 
wrote
 in a Twitter thread about the Capitol Police budget on Jan. 8. That tweet was taken down after this article&#39;s publication.
U.S. Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick died after defending the Capitol on Jan. 6.
Two of the earlier tweets in the thread have also been deleted. Tatro&#39;s Twitter bio includes the disclaimer &#34;my views.&#34;

Tatro characterized looting as &#34;protests against systemic racism&#34; in August.
&#34;I don&#39;t understand why you can&#39;t CONDEMN VIOLENT POLICE [and] acknowledge LOOTING as a VITAL form of social PROTEST. And, how about YOU not use sterilized language when referring to state sanctioned murder while maligning protests against the systemic racism that enables it,&#34; Tatro 
responded
 to another user&#39;s tweet about calling for both police reform and condemnation violence and looting.
Tatro also compared reforming police to reviving Nazism.
AOC BREAKS HER FUNDRAISING RECORD IN CRUSADE TO TAKE ON DCCC
&#34;To all those people who want to reform the police because all cops aren&#39;t bad, should we just go ahead and revive Nazism because all Nazis weren&#39;t bad? I didn&#39;t think so. Case closed,&#34; he wrote on 
Twitter
 in June.
DCCC spokesman Cole Leiter pushed back against a 
New York Post
 article published Sunday night that highlighted Tatro&#39;s past as a gang member who was convicted for shooting two rival gang members more than a decade ago. Tatro was featured in the 2019 documentary &#34;College Behind Bars&#34; for earning his bachelor&#39;s degree while in prison.
&#34;Dyjuan Tatro serves his time. Then DCCC hires him after he becomes a national leader in a bipartisan movement to reform prison education systems. [New York] Post publishes trash headline,&#34; Leiter wrote on 
Twitter
 on Monday morning.
A DCCC 
press release
 announcing Tatro&#39;s hire said he and other operatives would bring &#34;years of critical experience in progressive politics, and a valuable range of background.&#34;
&#34;I&#39;m thrilled to welcome these seasoned operatives on board,&#34; DCCC Chair Sean Patrick Maloney said Feb. 3.

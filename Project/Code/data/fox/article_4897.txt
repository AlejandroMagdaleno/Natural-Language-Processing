U.S. Rep. 
Ilhan Omar
 introduced two 
guaranteed income
 
bills 
on Friday, aimed at sending $1,200 monthly checks to most Americans before the end of the decade, according to reports. 
The SUPPORT Act would fund current local guaranteed income pilot programs around the country through a $2.5 billion grant program and findings would be taken between 2023 and 2027 toward the formation of a national program, WCCO-TV in Minneapolis reported. 
Starting in 2028, the national program would send $1,200 per month for people making less than $75,000 a year or heads of household making less than $112,500 a year plus $600 for each child. 
&#34;Poverty is a choice,&#34; Omar, a 
Minnesota
 Democrat, said in a statement about the bills. &#34;For too long we have prioritized endless growth while millions are homeless, hungry or without healthcare. We as a nation have the ability to make sure everyone has their basic needs like food, housing and healthcare met.&#34;

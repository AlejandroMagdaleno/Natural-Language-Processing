National Security correspondent Jennifer Griffin explains why military members are hesitant to get vaccinated and what the pentagon is doing to help.
New York
’s digital Excelsior Pass – touted by Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 as an important step toward normalcy during the 
coronavirus
 pandemic – has rejected some 
vaccinated
 users due to 
glitches
 and errors, according to reports. 
Cuomo 
announced the Excelsior Pass
 on March 26, launching the nation’s first &#34;vaccine passport&#34; on April 2. The pass, which is downloaded to a user’s phone, requires some information to check against state records to verify that an individual has been vaccinated or has recently tested negative for COVID-19. 
With some 
sports venues and businesses requiring proof of vaccination
, the pass should make it easier to verify a person’s vaccine status. The Cuomo administration maintains that the &#34;overwhelming majority of users have a seamless experience&#34; using the pass.

Vaccine passports being developed to verify COVID-19 immunization status and allow inoculated people to more freely travel, shop and dine have become the latest flash point in America’s perpetual political wars, with Republicans portraying them as a heavy-handed intrusion into personal freedom and private health choices.

However, some users have found that even after full vaccination the pass is rejecting their information.

Users find a message that reads &#34;We couldn’t find your pass&#34; after registration, which is reportedly caused by a mix of clerical errors – such as two people having the same name – or inconsistent data gathering, 
the Times Union reported
. 
Another issue arose due to a series of platform crashes during the early stages of the vaccine rollout.

Apple claimed that he was &#34;inundated&#34; with calls for help after he posted on Facebook asking anyone who had difficulty registering for Excelsior to contact his department.

Rep. French Hill R-Ark., tells &#39;Fox Report&#39; that the Democratic senator&#39;s decision shows &#39;speaks to the center-right nature of West Virginia and our country&#39;
Jemele Hill, the ex-ESPN anchor who hosts the podcast &#34;Jemele Hill is Unbothered,&#34; excoriated Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., in a Twitter post Sunday shortly after the moderate said he will not support the Democratic bill that aims to be the largest 
overhaul of election law in a generation
.
Democrats called the bill essential in protecting access to the ballot, but Manchin wrote in the 
Charleston Gazette-Mail
 that any &#34;election reform that is done in a partisan manner will all but ensure partisan divisions continue to deepen.&#34;
Hill retweeted the Associated Press’ report on Manchin’s position and wrote that his decision is &#34;so on brand for this country.&#34;
LIBERAL DARK MONEY GROUP LAUNCHES ADS TARGETING SINEMA, MANCHIN TO SUPPORT S1 ELECTION BILL
&#34;Record number of black voters show up to save this democracy, only for white supremacy to be upheld by a cowardly, power-hungry white dude. @Sen_JoeManchin is a clown,&#34; she tweeted.
The tweet was liked 13,000 times as of late Sunday night. One of the users who retweeted the message was Vice President Kamala Harris&#39; niece Meena Harris.
Hill, a staff writer at The Atlantic, has been known for her controversial posts. In July, she declared that anyone who voted for former President Trump is a &#34;racist.&#34;

&#34;If you vote for Donald Trump, you are a racist,&#34; she posted. &#34;You have no wiggle room.&#34;
Manchin told &#34;
Fox News Sunday
&#34; that he will vote against his 
Democratic
 colleagues&#39; For the People Act, because it&#39;s too partisan.
&#34;It&#39;s the wrong piece of legislation to bring our country together and unite our country, and I&#39;m not supporting that because I think it would divide us more. I don&#39;t want to be in a country that&#39;s divided any further,&#34; he told Fox.
The bill casts a wide net over the voting process, including requiring states to automatically register eligible voters and offer same-day voter registration. 
The measure also requires states to offer 15 days of early voting and allows no-excuse absentee balloting, which 14 states would have to implement. The states that already allow it would have to conform to the bill&#39;s standards.
&#34;I think there&#39;s a lot of great things in that piece of legislation, but there&#39;s an awful lot of things that basically don&#39;t pertain directly to voting,&#34; the senator said.

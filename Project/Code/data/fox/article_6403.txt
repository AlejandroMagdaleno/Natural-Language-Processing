Secretary of State Antony Blinken explains that in the last 24 hours, about 8,000 people boarded 60 flights and were evacuated from the Kabul airport in Afghanistan.
President Biden&#39;s
 National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday admitted that the administration still does not know how many Americans are in Afghanistan.
CNN 
&#34;State of the Union&#34; host Brianna Keilar asked Sullivan if he could tell her how many Americans and legal permanent residents are still waiting to be evacuated in 
Afghanistan.
BIDEN SAYS &#39;WE WILL GET YOU HOME&#39; TO AMERICANS TRAPPED IN AFGHANISTAN EXIT, BUT NOT SURE HOW MANY STILL THERE
&#34;We cannot give you a precise number,&#34; Sullivan said. &#34;We believe it is several thousand Americans who we are working with now to try to get safely out of the country.&#34;
He then blamed Americans not registering or deregistering properly at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul for why they do not know the exact number.
&#34;The reason we can&#39;t give you a precise number is that we ask Americans, when they come to Afghanistan, to register with the embassy. Many come and do that, but then they leave and never deregister,&#34; Sullivan said. &#34;Many others come and don&#39;t register at all. That is their right. It was their right, of course, to remain in Afghanistan as long as they wanted and it&#39;s our responsibility to get them out.&#34;
Sullivan isn&#39;t the only Biden administration official who hasn&#39;t been able to answer questions about the number of Americans in Afghanistan. Last week, 
Pentagon
 spokesman John Kirby said, &#34;I don&#39;t know&#34; in response to the same question and then was 
pressed again
 in a follow-up question asking how the Biden administration doesn&#39;t know these numbers.

&#34;I think as you probably know, first of all, the State Department would be a better place to go for an estimate of how many Americans are in Afghanistan or in and around Kabul. That is not a figure that the United States military would know, and I think you also know not every American citizen in another country that there’s no obligation that they register their presence. And that you can have a perfect accurate count,&#34; Kirby said.
However, when State Department Spokesman Ned Price was asked later that day about the number of Americans still waiting to be rescued in Afghanistan, he 
replied
, &#34;We’re just not in a position to give a number right now.&#34;
&#34;We’re more broadly, not in position to offer an aggregate figure, because we are putting forward offers to individuals who may be interested in relocating,&#34; Price added.

Despite not knowing how many Americans are still in Afghanistan, Biden on Friday 
said
, &#34;Let me be clear, any American who wants to come home, we will get you home.&#34;
&#34;Make no mistake, this evacuation mission is dangerous and involves risks to our armed forces. And it&#39;s being conducted under difficult circumstances. I cannot promise what the final outcome will be, or what it will be that it will be without risk of loss.,&#34; Biden continued. &#34;But as commander in chief, I can assure you that I will mobilize every resource necessary.&#34;

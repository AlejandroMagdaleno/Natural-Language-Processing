President Biden
 had his first phone call with British Prime Minister 
Boris Johnson
 on Saturday, where Johnson pressed the new president for a U.S.-U.K. trade deal. 
Johnson also welcomed some of Biden’s new executive actions. 
&#34;The Prime Minister warmly welcomed the President’s decision to re-join the Paris Agreement on climate change, as well as the World Health Organization and the COVAX programme to ensure equitable access for vaccines,&#34; a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement, adding that Johnson praised Biden’s early action to tackle climate change. 
 &#34;They also discussed the benefits of a potential free trade deal between our two countries, and the Prime Minister reiterated his intention to resolve existing trade issues as soon as possible,&#34; the spokesperson continued.

The U.K. only recently regained control over its national trade policy after the end of a post-Brexit transition period. 
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said forging a new trade deal was low on Biden’s list of priorities, as he was focusing attention on getting the coronavirus pandemic under control and getting his $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill passed.
The White House in its own statement said the two leaders discussed climate change, curbing Covid-19 and shared foreign policy priorities in China, Iran and Russia.

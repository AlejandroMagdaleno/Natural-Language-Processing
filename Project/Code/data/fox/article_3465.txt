Cardiologist tells &#39;Tucker Carlson Today&#39; why he is &#34;deeply concerned&#34; with the way the world has treated the virus
A new episode of &#34;
Tucker Carlson Today
&#34; cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough discusses why more than a year into the pandemic, doctor&#39;s still don&#39;t have an official treatment protocol for coronavirus and tells host Tucker Carlson who he thinks shouldn&#39;t get the vaccine.
During the interview, McCullough says &#34;something has gone off the rails in the world&#34; with treating COVID-19, asserting he has no agenda but is &#34;deeply concerned&#34; about the science, medical literature and the irregular response to the virus that kept populations &#34;in fear, in isolation and despair.&#34;
McCullough then questioned why the FDA and big drug companies &#34;strictly excluded&#34; from clinical trials those who were suspected to be COVID recovered, those with antibodies, pregnant women, and women of childbearing potential who couldn’t assure contraception, noting that is a &#34;huge group of exclusions, that’s a giant part of the healthcare workforce.&#34;
&#34;So if they weren’t eligible for the randomized trials, and the FDA and the sponsors thought maybe there was a problem with safety, or they had no chance of benefit, and only a small chance of these safety events exclude them. Why would they electively go into an investigational program now?&#34;
McCullough then turned his attention to why so little attention has been given to COVID treatments and to the &#34;enormous amount of fear&#34; the virus created saying for the first time in America doctors and nurses were confronted with a disease that they themselves could contract and die from, &#34;that fear drove everything.&#34;
Discussing vaccine safety, McCullough told Carlson he is not recommending pregnant women get the vaccine.
&#34;We have no information on safety and we have no information on efficacy. It violates a simple medical practice principle, we don’t use things where we don’t have a signal of benefit or acceptable safety. We don’t do it.&#34;

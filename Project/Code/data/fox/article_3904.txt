South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem says she&#39;s been vindicated from critics
The Conservative Political Action Conference (
CPAC
) wrapped its third day after addresses from a number of political heavyweights. 
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., pulled out of the day&#39;s events, citing an &#34;unexpected family issue.&#34; 
Here are four key moments from the day&#39;s events: 
Pompeo says China was ‘smiling’ when U.S. reentered Paris Climate Accord
&#34;The Paris Agreement was a fantasy for elite diplomats who just wanted to virtue signal,&#34; former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. &#34;When President Biden reentered this deal I can tell you that Xi Jinping was smiling every single minute.&#34;
&#34;Since I last saw you the Chinese have sanctioned me,&#34; former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the crowd. &#34;The Iranians don&#39;t think so much of me either.&#34; China imposed sanctions on Trump administration officials for calling China&#39;s actions against Uighurs and Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region a &#34;genocide. 
&#34;Team Biden appears to be headed back into appeasing Iran. This will be a disaster for the United States of America and a disaster for the region as well.&#34;
Boebert says Democrats are ‘the party of no’s’ 
Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., said that while the GOP gets a reputation as the &#34;party of no,&#34; it’s actually Democrats who embody the word. 
&#34;Republicans are called the party of no but we&#39;re saying no to all of their no.  They don’t want you to be able to protect yourself, they don&#39;t want you to have freedom of speech, they don&#39;t want you to have freedom of religion... they are the party of no. We are saying no, we are saying a big ‘hell no’ to all of their no’s,&#34; the fiery freshman lawmaker and gun rights activist told the crowd. 
McCarthy predicts GOP will take the majority in 2022
&#34;It’s not a chance, we’re going to get the majority back. We’re five seats away,&#34; McCarthy said Saturday during a panel at CPAC. 
&#34;I would bet my house... don&#39;t tell my wife but I would bet it,&#34; he said. 
&#34;This is the smallest majority Democrats have had in 100 years,&#34; McCarthy said. Republicans picked up 12 seats in the 2020 election, and FiveThirtyEight predicted they are &#34;on track&#34; to take back the House in the next election. 
Noem slams Fauci
South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a star attraction at Saturday’s event, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, is &#34;wrong a lot.&#34; 
NOEM BLASTS FAUCI, CONTRASTS HER COVID HANDLING WITH CUOMO&#39;S
&#34;I don&#39;t know if you agree with me, but Dr. Fauci is wrong a lot.&#34; she said. Noem was the only governor to never shut down businesses to contain Covid-19. She said Fauci predicted her state would fare much worse. 
&#34;In South Dakota, I provided all of the information that we had to our people, and then I trusted to make the best decisions for themselves [on how to prevent the spread of the virus] for their families and in turn their communities,&#34; she said.
&#34;We never focused on the case numbers. Instead, we kept our eye on hospital capacity. Now, Dr. Fauci, he told me that on my worst day I&#39;d have ten thousand patients in the hospital on our worst day, we had a little over six hundred.&#34;

Noem recalled being routinely lambasted by the press and some Democrats as &#34;ill-informed, reckless and even a &#39;denier&#39;.&#34;Some even claimed that South Dakota is &#39;as bad as it gets anywhere in the world&#39; when it comes to COVID-19—that is a lie,&#34; she said.

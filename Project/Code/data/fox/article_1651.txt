We can never repay that debt,&#34; Biden said. &#34;But I promise you this, to all the Gold Star families across the country, we will never, ever, ever, ever forget.&#34;
Biden said threats to America have changed since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the United States will &#34;update our security stance&#34; to reflect the new reality.

Biden talked at length about his late son Beau, a veteran, and how serving in the military was one of his eldest son&#39;s proudest achievements. The president said his family recognizes the service members&#39; sacrifices and said he wants to know how &#34;we can support you better.&#34;
&#34;My message to all of you is quite simple: Thank you,&#34; Biden told the troops.

Former state department official Kiron Skinner discusses the upcoming Biden-Putin summit on &#39;Fox News Live&#39;
President Joe Biden
 fumbled during a press conference at the G-7 summit Sunday, mixing up 
&#34;Libya&#34; and &#34;Syria&#34;
 – not once, but three times – while discussing humanitarian aid to countries torn apart by civil war. 
The gaffe-prone president was discussing possibly working with Russia in providing &#34;vital assistance&#34; to &#34;Libya&#34; – a &#34;population that’s in real trouble.&#34; 
He then said that Russia had bitten off more than it can chew with its intervention in &#34;Syria,&#34; but then added &#34;Libya&#34; to the mix. 
&#34;As long as they’re there without the ability to bring about some order in the region, you can’t do that very well without providing for the basic economic needs of people,&#34; Biden said. &#34;So, I’m hopeful that we can find an accommodation where we can save the lives of people in, for example, in Libya.&#34;

Biden&#39;s aides later brushed off the apparent gaffe, saying that he had meant to say Syria when saying Libya. But the president was widely hounded on social media.

The online outlet RedState, editorialized that Biden had gone &#34;off the rails&#34; with his press conference. 
The mix-up came on the last day of the annual G-7 summit in Cornwall, in the southwest of England.
Biden later traveled to Windsor Castle for a private audience with the queen – becoming the 13th president to have met with the 95-year-old monarch.

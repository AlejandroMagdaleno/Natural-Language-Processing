Former 
Wisconsin 
Gov. 
Scott Walker
 is charging that the nation is &#34;under siege&#34; from the political left.
During a speech Friday at the 
Conservative Political Action Conference
, the former two-term Republican governor emphasized, &#34;America is under siege. We see it on our campuses. We see it in our culture, and increasingly we see it in our communications with the censorship from Big Tech, left-wing professors, liberal activists, mass media, even some of our major corporations are attempting to cancel conservative thought.&#34;

Walker, who briefly ran for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination and who’s served as president of the conservative Young America’s Foundation since 2019, argued that &#34;they don&#39;t want to compete with us in the battle of ideas because they know they lose. They just want to cancel.&#34;
The former governor claimed that &#34;half of all the liberal students say it&#39;s OK to infringe upon the free speech rights of other students because they offend others. Apparently, they offend anybody except for conservatives. Let&#39;s be clear, young people did not learn this on their own, years of left-wing professors and increasingly large numbers of radical activists on campus have shaped a new generation of snowflakes.&#34;

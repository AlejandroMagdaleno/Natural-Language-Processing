&#34;We come not as an insurrection group, but as a resurrection group,&#34; Jackson shouted as the two men marched down Constitution Avenue with hundreds of demonstrators,&#34; according to the Religion News Service. &#34;Today we must fill up the jails. … If you call yourself a child of God, you oughta act like it sometimes.&#34;
In all, nearly two dozen protesters were taken into custody during the Poor People’s Campaign rally, accused of crowding and blocking traffic, according to FOX 5 in Washington. 
The civil rights activists called on Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to support a $15 minimum wage and pass the Democrats’ voting rights bill that Republicans successfully filibustered Tuesday.

said
 McConnell still had time to &#34;repent.&#34; 
The march was dubbed &#34;A National Call for Moral Revival&#34;

A provision in House 
Democratic
 voting reform bill H.R. 1 that would require the government match congressional candidates&#39; small-dollar donations would amplify polarization and reward candidates at the extreme ends of their parties, like Reps. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 and Marjorie Taylor Greene, experts told Fox News.
&#34;For those who really are thinking this will help to bring more average Americans in, get more diverse views, moderate the system and do away with special interests, I think they’re going to be very disappointed,&#34; Brad Smith, founder of the Institute for Free Speech and a former FEC chairman, told Fox News in an interview.
DEMOCRATS&#39; ELECTIONS BILL RAISES MAJOR FREE SPEECH CONCERNS, EXPERTS WARN
&#34;It doesn’t do away with special interests. It just changes the special interests and how they go about it,&#34; he said.
The 
For the People Act of 2021
, known as H.R. 1, would provide 
public matching funds
 for qualifying congressional and presidential candidates at a rate of 6:1, among many other provisions. The 6:1 match would kick in for each grassroots contribution to a candidate up to $200. For example, a $200 donation to a House candidate would garner a $1,200 match in public funds for a total contribution of $1,400.

Institute for Free Speech President David Keating described the provision &#34;as a subsidy for Congress’ most powerful, famous, and notorious members.&#34;
&#34;In just three months, several candidates have already received enough donations to trigger the maximum allowable taxpayer subsidy — roughly $6.7 million in public funds,&#34; Keating told Fox News in a statement. &#34;They include controversial figures such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Matt Gaetz, 
Nancy Pelosi
, and Adam Schiff. If H.R. 1 becomes law, candidates who dominate the media will dominate fundraising.&#34;
Ocasio-Cortez raised 
$2.27 million
 in small-dollar contributions in the first quarter of 2021, while Greene raised 
$2.56 million
.
Numerous studies show that candidates on the edges of the political spectrum tend to attract the most small-dollar contributions, Smith said.
HR1&#39;S SWEEPING CHANGES AND DEADLINES COULD SOW &#39;CONFUSION, CHAOS, FRAUD, AND LITIGATION,’ REPORT SAYS
&#34;Essentially, what you’d be doing is giving a lot of federal money to many of the candidates who are on the most extreme ends of their parties,&#34; Smith said. &#34;Almost all the Democrats support it. Many of them consider themselves moderates, centrists. ... I’m not sure a lot of folks have thought through that dynamic.&#34;
Smith pointed out that Democrats have dominated small-dollar contributions in recent years.
&#34;One can’t help but notice that, given current fundraising patterns, Democrats would do really, really well with this compared with Republicans,&#34; he said.

Some countries use public funds to subsidize political parties, but that&#39;s not included in H.R. 1.
&#34;There’s a zillion ways to do public funding, and a very common way is to simply give money to the political parties. ... It seems to me this kind of matching contributions to candidates is really rare,&#34; Smith said. &#34;A lot of people think there’s more public funding of campaigns overseas than there is. In almost every country, private funding remains the backbone.&#34;
The public match program would be funded by a new 4.75% surcharge on criminal and civil penalties and settlements that corporations pay to the U.S. government. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office 
estimated
 the new revenue stream would generate about $3.2 billion over 10 years.

The proceeds from these additional corporate settlement assessments would be deposited into a new &#34;Freedom From Influence Fund&#34; created under the legislation. 
&#34;Let&#39;s be very clear, there is no public funding – use of taxpayer money – for congressional races in this legislation no matter what you hear someone else [say],&#34; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. 
H.R. 1 
passed
 the 
House of Representatives
 by a vote of 220-210 in March.

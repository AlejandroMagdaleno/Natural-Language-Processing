 Board of 
Education
 removed Vice President Alison Collins from her leadership role, according to a report.

school board
 said helped &#34;perpetuate gross and harmful stereotypes&#34; against the Asian community.

Although the vote removed Collins’ VP title it did not remove her from the school board,

Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich reacts to video of border patrol agents encountering an abandoned migrant child on ‘Fox &amp;amp; Friends First.’
A vulnerable House Democrat agreed with Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
, D-Calif., that the southern border &#34;is on a good path&#34; despite the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) projecting the 
largest
 surge in two decades.
Rep. Cindy Axne, D-Iowa, is considered one of the more vulnerable Democratic incumbents heading into the 2022 midterm 
elections
, after narrowly winning in 2020 with less than 50% of the vote.
Republicans plan on using Biden&#39;s 
weakness 
on the border against Democrats in swing districts. Still, Axne hesitated to break with party leadership on the crisis. 
HOUSTON FACILITY FOR MIGRANT GIRLS 13-17 ABRUPTLY SHUTTERED AMID CROWDING CONCERNS, EMPLOYEE DEATH: REPORTS
Axne was asked in an intervew Thursday if she agreed with Pelosi that the southern border was 
&#34;on a good path&#34;
 under 
President Biden&#39;s
 leadership.
Axne said she does agree with Pelosi &#34;because we now have a president in office that actually wants to tackle this issue that’s been before us for years.&#34;
&#34;We have a broken immigration system in this country. This has been an issue for a long time,&#34; she 
told
 Iowa Public Radio.
&#34;Congress first promised to address comprehensive immigration reform over a decade ago. And unfortunately, broken Washington politics and partisanship has meant there hasn’t been a fix.&#34;
BORDER CRISIS: 233% INCREASE IN FENTANYL SEIZURES AT SOUTHERN BORDER
The congresswoman said her constituents &#34;want to see a lasting fix&#34; to the situation at the southern border as well as the nation&#39;s &#34;broken immigration system.&#34;
&#34;This is not something that just happened. We did not… come to this overnight,&#34; said Axne. &#34;And I’m committed to achieving that real reform.&#34;

Axne is on the NRCC&#39;s list of 
47 vulnerable Democrats
 whose seats are &#34;offensive pickup opportunities&#34; in the 2022 midterms.
National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesman Mike Berg told Fox News that Axne follows Pelosi&#39;s orders and the representative&#39;s take on the border crisis does not sit well with Iowans.
&#34;Cindy Axne takes whatever position Nancy Pelosi tells her to take,&#34; said Berg. &#34;Axne and Pelosi&#39;s open borders agenda may play well in San Francisco, but it doesn&#39;t work for Iowa.&#34;

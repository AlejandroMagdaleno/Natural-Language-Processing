Wisconsin
 parents will soon be able to select a gender-neutral option on birth forms that was praised by the state&#39;s governor and criticized by opponents. 
Fox6Now.com reported
 that starting July 1, birth forms in the state-- which help generate birth certificates-- will include the option for &#34;parent-parent,&#34; &#34;parent giving birth&#34; and &#34;mother-father.&#34; 
Gov. Tony Evers, the Democrat, said that the change reflects his &#34;administration’s commitment to gender-neutral terminology and recognizing that Wisconsin families are diverse and should be valued and respected.&#34;
Rep. Gae Magnafici, the Republican chairwoman of the Assembly Family Law committee, said the policy &#34;is something that even the best satire writers cannot imagine,&#34; 
according to
 the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.
&#34;As the Assembly chair of Family Law, a nurse, and a mom, I am insulted. I’m calling on Governor Evers to stop downplaying womanhood, stop downplaying motherhood, and stop downplaying settled science,&#34; she said.

Starting July 1, the birth forms will also be available in English, Spanish and Hmong, Fox 6 Now reported. The station said these changes are consistent with other public-facing forms within Vital Records &#34;that use spouse-spouse and other gender-neutral languages.&#34;

Tennessee Governor Bill Lee says the state must lift restrictions and start focusing on economic recovery
New Jersey
 Gov. 
Phil Murphy
 has warned residents that they risk being turned away from 
polling
 places if they don’t wear a 
face mask
. 
Murphy issued the advisory during a COVID-19 briefing on Wednesday, saying: &#34;If you refuse to wear a mask, we’re not letting you in.&#34; 
&#34;It’s that simple,&#34; Murphy said 
in response to a question
 on mask policy. &#34;You’ve got to wear a mask if you’re going into a store, going into a restaurant. You’ve got to wear one going to the Motor Vehicles Commission, wherever you’re going.&#34;
SKIPPING SECOND COVID-19 VACCINE DOSE COULD &#39;PROLONG PANDEMIC,&#39; RESEARCHERS WARN
&#34;If you’re indoors, you’ve got to wear a mask,&#34; he added.
The governor tweeted a &#34;reminder&#34; around the same time as his briefing, reiterating that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance only relaxes outdoor mask use, but that &#34;masking-up remains mandatory indoors.&#34;

Murphy noted, however, that poll workers will not be required to be vaccinated: The state will only &#34;strongly, strongly, strongly&#34; encourage that they get the shot, he said.
Murphy&#39;s office did not return Fox New&#39;s request for comment. 
The state reportedly enforced the same stance at school board elections last week in six districts across the state, 
N.J. 1015 reported

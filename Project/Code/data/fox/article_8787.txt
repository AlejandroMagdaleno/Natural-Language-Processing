Texas attorney general discusses the looming immigration crisis at the southern border.
Texas
 Attorney General Ken Paxton is defending a rule that limits entry for 
immigrants
 and their likely use of public benefits. 
&#34;It cost the country billions of dollars,&#34; Paxton stated on &#34;
Sunday Morning Futures
,&#34; on Fox News, &#34;If we&#39;re going to invite people in, we&#39;ve got to make sure they can take care of themselves and that they&#39;re not going to end up on food stamps and Medicaid and health care insurance from our country.&#34;
Paxton explained that the &#34;public charge&#34; rule, put in place to set boundaries on public assistance for immigrants, was never official until the Clinton administration federally enforced it. The rule was halted in 2020 after a court order.
HOW WILL TRUMP&#39;S &#39;PUBLIC CHARGE&#39; RULE AFFECT IMMIGRANTS?
Now, President Biden has dropped the rule, prompting Paxton to the Supreme Court to defend the rule in court.

&#34;It’s very unfair to these border towns. A lot of these towns are smaller,&#34; said Paxton, &#34;there’s so many people coming across....there’s so much demand on their services, especially with these children.&#34;Plus, added Paxton, &#34; throw in the mix of COVID and other potential communicable diseases and they are overwhelmed and they are at risk.&#34;
Simply put, Paxton said what is happening at the border &#34;is a humanitarian disaster&#34; and it is the border towns that &#34;are suffering more than any others.&#34;

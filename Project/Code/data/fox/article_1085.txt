Fox News&#39; Howard Kurtz says its unclear if Congress will be able to pass a bipartisan bill
President Biden
 appeared to forget the name of 
Australian
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison during a joint press conference Wednesday evening, calling him &#34;Mr. Prime Minister&#34; and &#34;that fellow Down Under.&#34; 
Biden announced Wednesday a trilateral 
security
 partnership with 
Britain
 and Australia, called AUKUS, which includes the sharing of advanced 
technologies,
 like artificial intelligence and the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines, among the three countries.
BIDEN GAFFE: PRESIDENT CALLS MICHIGAN&#39;S WHITMER &#39;JENNIFER&#39; AT WHITE HOUSE EVENT, REPORT SAYS
The president gave a joint press conference with U.K. Prime Minister
 Boris Johnson
 and Australian PM Scott Morrison joining virtually on two television screens.
&#34;Thank you Boris,&#34; Biden said to the British PM before turning to Morrison.
&#34;And I want to thank that fellow Down Under,&#34; the president said, pointing to the Australian PM. &#34;Thank you very much, pal. Appreciate it, Mr. Prime Minister.&#34;
Biden later addressed Morrison by name when reading off his teleprompter.
&#34;As Prime Minister Morrison and Prime Minister Johnson said, I want to thank you for this partnership, your vision as we embark together on this strategic mission,&#34; 
the president said
. &#34;Although Australia, the UK and U.S. partnership — AUKUS — it sounds strange with all these acronyms, but it’s a good one, AUKUS — our nations will update and enhance our shared ability to take on the threats of the 21st century just as we did in the 20th century: together.&#34;
Prominent Australian news outlets like The Australian and Sky News pounced on the gaffe, and #ThatFellaDownUnder became a trending topic on Twitter.
Morrison didn’t acknowledge the slip-up but hailed the agreement as a &#34;forever partnership for a new time between the oldest and most trusted of friends.&#34;

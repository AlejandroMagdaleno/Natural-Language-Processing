President Biden met
 with Russian President 
Vladimir Putin
 on Wednesday for a highly anticipated showdown between the two leaders. 
They met in Geneva Wednesday morning for a half-day of talks between the two presidents and aides behind closed doors.
When asked Tuesday if he was ready for Wednesday&#39;s talks, Biden replied, &#34;I am always ready.&#34;
Biden had called Putin a &#34;worthy adversary,&#34; on Monday prior to their long-anticipated meeting. His comments came after he agreed Putin was a &#34;killer&#34; earlier this year. 
Biden and Putin were expected to discuss a range of issues, including Iran and North Korea&#39;s nuclear capabilities, Syria, the Arctic, strategic stability, arms control, climate change, and COVID-19.
The president was also expected to 
raise the issue 
of Russia-based ransomware attacks with Putin during their summit, the White House said after critical infrastructure in the U.S. fell victim to another attack. 
Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of 
Senate
 
lawmakers called on Biden to raise the issue of 
directed-energy microwave
 incidents targeting U.S. diplomats and top national security and 
CIA
 officials.

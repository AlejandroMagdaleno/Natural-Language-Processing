Michael Pillsbury, Director for Chinese Strategy at the Hudson Institute, joined &#39;America&#39;s Newsroom&#39; to weigh in on China &#39;aggressive&#39; impact, calling it a &#39;dangerous situation that the Biden team is very much aware of.&#39;
The threat the United States faces from 
China
 is &#34;troubling,&#34; The Hudson Institute&#39;s Michael Pillsbury told &#34;
America’s Newsroom
,&#34; warning about Russia and Iran acting 
in concert with Beijing
.  
&#34;The Chinese, in their comments on the Biden administration, say that there are two factions, there&#39;s kind of a continuity with President Trump group that wants to be tough or even tougher on China. But there&#39;s also a softer group that wants to cooperate, work together on climate change,&#34; said the author of 
&#34;Hundred Year Marathon.&#34;
Pillsbury explained further that China notices the &#34;split&#34; within the Biden administration, adding that he&#39;s worried about China&#39;s &#34;saber-rattling about Taiwan.&#34;

Pillsbury reacted to a 
piece
 by the Wall Street Journal detailing China&#39;s message toward the United States that they are &#34;equal.&#34; The piece titled, &#34;China&#39;s Message to America: We&#39;re An Equal Now&#34; goes in-depth on China&#39;s plans to challenge the United States as the &#34;global leader.&#34; 
&#34;As Biden administration officials expected in their first meeting with Chinese counterparts, Yang Jiechi, Mr. Xi’s top foreign-policy aide, and Foreign Minister Wang Yi 
asked them to roll back Trump-era policies targeting China.
 Beijing wanted to restore the kind of recurring &#34;dialogue&#34; Washington sees as a waste of time, say U.S. and Chinese officials briefed on the Alaska meeting,&#34; the piece says.
The piece went on to say, &#34;Mr. Yang also delivered a surprise: a 16-minute 
lecture about America’s racial problems and democratic failings
. The objective, say Chinese officials, was to make clear that Beijing sees itself as an equal of the U.S. He also warned Washington against challenging China over a mission Beijing views as sacred—the eventual reunification with Taiwan.&#34;

Pillsbury said that though a &#34;global world order&#34; was set up by the United States in 1945, the Russians and Chinese want to challenge that world order.
&#34;This is a strange challenge coming from these two powers. And when they bring in Iran, I mean, Iran is the source of their oil and gas. It&#39;s got a lot of money to buy weapons. They see it as the main way to tie down the Americans in the Middle East.&#34;
Pillsbury concluded, &#34;So we&#39;re heading into troubled waters.&#34;
Sen. Marsha Blackburn
, R-Tenn., said Sunday on Fox News that China, Russia, Iran and North Korea are the &#34;new axis of evil&#34; and that the communist regime in Beijing is &#34;testing the Biden administration.&#34;

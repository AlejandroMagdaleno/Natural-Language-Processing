Fox News contributor Joe Concha breaks down the fallout from progressive Democrats’ ‘woke’ agenda.
A Justice 
Democrats
-backed candidate for Congress in 
Illinois
 participated in a defund the police rally and called for the abolition of the U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE).
On Tuesday, Chicago activist Kina Collins 
announced
 a primary challenge against the long-serving incumbent, Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill., who has represented the area in Congress since 1997.
Collins is backed by Justice Democrats, the far-left organization that has worked to put progressive candidates in office, such as &#34;Squad&#34; members Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.
The Justice Democrats’ newest candidate has a history of pushing for controversial causes, such as defunding the police.

In fact, Collins was 
front and center
 filming a Facebook Live video of a &#34;Defund the Police&#34; rally in July 2020 and marched with protesters chanting to &#34;defund the police&#34; in a 
separate
 Facebook Live video the same day.
Collins — a gun violence prevention activist — has also called for the 
abolition
 of ICE, claiming in 
multiple
 Facebook posts that &#34;immigrant families are constantly living in a state of fear, and the physical and mental trauma is destroying the fabric of our society.&#34;
&#34;Stoked by a US President fueled by white nationalism, immigrants are being targeted in violent attacks by extremists and at the same time are overpoliced and detained by a government that should be doing everything to protect them,&#34; Collins wrote.
&#34;There is no middle ground - ICE must be abolished and its practices and abuses under this administration must be investigated. #AbolishICE,&#34; she also wrote.

She made a similar post to her 
Instagram page
 calling for people &#34;to push legislators to defund ICE&#34; before abolishing it completely.
Collins also supported the 
bail fund 
for arrested Black Lives Matter protesters in Atlanta, asking for a link to the fund in a June 2020 
Facebook
 post so she and others &#34;can start donating and getting our comrades out today and tomorrow.&#34;
The Justice Democrats-backed candidate also posted a photo of protesters 
burning down an Arby’s
 
to her Instagram in May 2020 with the caption &#34;AFRICAN PROVERB: The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth.&#34;
Collins did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.
Other recent Justice Democrat-backed candidates have come under media scrutiny as well.

House Oversight Committee chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., found herself facing down a primary challenge from activist Rana Abdelhamid. Abdelhamid, similarly to Collins, has 
demanded
 the defunding of law enforcement, saying it is a feminist &#34;priority&#34; in a now-deleted post.
Additionally, progressive candidate in Tennessee Odessa Kelly — who is also backed by the Justice Democrats — had previous inflammatory 
social media posts
, including one where she posted about attending a speech made by the anti-Semitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
Kelly is running against Blue Dog Democrat Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., in a primary challenge similar to Maloney and Davis.

Sen. Mike Lee says House Democrats letter asking Biden to give up singular power of nuclear launch codes.
Sen. 
Mike Lee
, R-Utah., said Thursday that it is &#39;really weird&#39; and &#39;unconstitutional&#39; that 
Democrats
 want to change the nuclear launch code policy, which places sole power in the hands of the 
president.
 
During an appearance on 
&#34;Fox &amp; Friends,&#34;
 Lee questioned where that power would ultimately reside if it were taken from President Joe Biden and called it &#39;horrible policy,&#39; citing the committee that was put in charge of defending the Capitol during the January riots as an example or mismanagement.

This seems really weird to me that they’d take that away - and by the way, who are they going to give that power to? They’re gonna give that to a committee? In addition to being wildly unconstitutional, this would be a horrible policy. Remember what happened when you put a committee in charge of protecting the Capitol? That didn’t end so well either.&#34;

 Thursday for his administration&#39;s harsh criticisms of Border Patrol&#39;s handling of the flood of Haitian migrants in Del Rio.

&#34;Joe Biden created this crisis. And now he&#39;s throwing the Border Patrol under the bus,&#34; Cotton wrote on Twitter. &#34;This will make things much worse.&#34;
Graham blasted the Biden administration as the &#34;most incompetent Administration in modern American history&#34; that has &#34;scapegoated and demagogued&#34; Border Patrol as they are &#34;asked to do the impossible.&#34;
&#34;The coyotes and cartels will appreciate the Biden Administration removing Border Patrol agents on horseback from this section of the border as it was slowing down their smuggling business,&#34; Graham tweeted on Thursday.
&#34;This is yet another surrender of the border by the Biden Administration,&#34; he added. &#34;It is only a matter of time until terrorists seize upon this debacle.&#34;
Several House Republicans stood by Border Patrol amid the accusations, with Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, telling Fox News on Tuesday that the agents &#34;are desperately trying to carry out their duties despite being woefully understaffed and lacking the resources they urgently need.&#34;

&#34;If [DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas] is truly ‘horrified’ as he said, he should tell President Biden to stop playing political games with our nation’s security and return to President Trump’s strong-border policies that were working,&#34; the Texas Republican said.
&#34;Close the border once and for all,&#34; Pfluger added.

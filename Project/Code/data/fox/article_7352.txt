Press secretary Jen Psaki said the current White House website refers to the &#34;Biden-Harris&#34; administration to underscore the vice president’s &#34;important role.&#34; 
A reporter asked Psaki in a news briefing Tuesday what message could be taken from the &#34;rebranding&#34; of the Biden administration to the Biden-Harris administration. Previous White Houses have primarily emphasized the president on their website and social media channels, although more recently, the vice president&#39;s role has been highlighted. 
&#34;I would take from it that Vice President Harris is an important partner, she&#39;s the first in the room and the last in the room on most occasions if she&#39;s in town,&#34; Psaki said, adding that it was a &#34;reflection of the important role she will play moving forward.&#34; 
Both Biden and Harris are also listed on the White House’s main 
Twitter page

Harris has also taken a number of solo calls with world leaders, just a few months into the new administration – a signal that she’ll engage deeply even in foreign policy, though her experience has been almost entirely in the domestic realm.

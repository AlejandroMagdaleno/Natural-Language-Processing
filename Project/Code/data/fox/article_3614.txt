Fox News contributor Lara Trump compares Trump and Biden&#39;s handling of the crisis at the border and COVID-19
Facebook
 removed a video of an interview with former President 
Trump
 conducted by his daughter-in-law Lara Trump, saying any content &#34;in the voice of Donald Trump&#34; would be scrubbed from the social media platform.
Facebook
 permanently banned the former president from their platform in January after the Capitol riot.
On Tuesday, Lara Trump, a Fox News contributor, posted an image on Instagram of her sitting across from her father-in-law, urging followers to &#34;Join us tonight!&#34;
A group of Trump officials were sent an email from a Facebook employee, warning that any content posted on Facebook and Instagram &#34;in the voice of President Trump is not currently allowed on our platforms (including new posts with President Trump speaking)&#34; and warned that it &#34;will be removed if posted, resulting in additional limitations on accounts that posted it.&#34;
TRUMP RETURNING TO SOCIAL MEDIA WITH PLATFORM OF HIS OWN, ADVISER SAYS
&#34;This guidance applies to all campaign accounts and Pages, including Team Trump, other campaign messaging vehicles on our platforms, and former surrogates,&#34; the email, posted on Instagram by Trump&#39;s son, Eric Trump, stated.
The interview was eventually posted to Lara Trump&#39;s Facebook page, but was later taken down.
&#34;Hi folks,&#34; a Facebook employee wrote in an email to her with the subject line &#34;Content Removal.&#34;
&#34;We are reaching out to let you know that we removed content from Lara Trump&#39;s Facebook Page that featured President Trump speaking,&#34; the Facebook employee wrote. &#34;In line with the block we placed on Donald Trump&#39;s Facebook and Instagram accounts, further content posted in the voice of Donald Trump will be removed and result in additional limitations on the accounts.&#34;
Lara Trump posted the email to her Instagram.
A source familiar confirmed the authenticity of the messages to Fox News.
Facebook did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.
Facebook moved to block Trump &#34;indefinitely&#34; after the Jan. 6 riot in the U.S. Capitol, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying that they &#34;believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.&#34;
Trump was also permanently banned from Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube after the riot.

But Trump senior adviser Jason Miller earlier this month said Trump would be back.
&#34;I do think that we&#39;re going to see President Trump returning to social media in probably about two or three months here, with his own platform,&#34; Miller told Fox News&#39; &#34;
#MediaBuzz
 earlier this month. &#34;And this is something that I think will be the hottest ticket in social media, it&#39;s going to completely redefine the game, and everybody is going to be waiting and watching to see what exactly President Trump does.&#34;
Miller said he was unable to provide details, but he did reveal that Trump had been having &#34;high-powered meetings&#34; at Mar-a-Lago with various teams regarding the venture, and that &#34;numerous companies&#34; had approached the former president.
&#34;This new platform is going to be big,&#34; Miller said, predicting that Trump will draw &#34;tens of millions of people.&#34;

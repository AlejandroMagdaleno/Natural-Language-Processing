United Refining Company Chairman and CEO John Catsimatidis tells &#39;Fox &amp; Friends&#39; that the president&#39;s green executive orders are concerning for the entire U.S. oil industry and economy.
Texas
 
Gov. 
Greg Abbott
, a Republican, ripped the 
White 
House
 
on Wednesday, saying Texas can help reduce the price of gasoline by producing more oil if the 
Biden 
administration
 will &#34;just stay out of the way.&#34;
Abbott posted a short open letter to the White House on Twitter Wednesday, touting that Texas could help bring down the price of gas by producing oil domestically.
&#34;Texas can do this,&#34; Abbott wrote. &#34;Our producers can easily produce that oil if your Administration will just stay out of the way.&#34;
WHITE HOUSE’S OPEC BLAME MASKS BAD US ENERGY POLICY
The Texas governor called on the Biden administration to allow &#34;American workers — not OPEC — [to] produce the oil that can reduce the price of gasoline.&#34;
&#34;Don’t make us dependent on foreign sources of energy,&#34; Abbott added.
Abbott’s tweet came in response to national security adviser Jake Sullivan&#39;s recent statement calling on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase its oil output.
&#34;While OPEC+ recently agreed to production increases, these increases will not fully offset previous production cuts that OPEC+ imposed during the pandemic until well into 2022,&#34; Sullivan said. &#34;At a critical moment in the global recovery, this is simply not enough.&#34;
&#34;We are engaging with relevant OPEC+ members on the importance of competitive markets in setting prices,&#34; the national security adviser continued. &#34;Competitive energy markets will ensure reliable and stable energy supplies, and OPEC+ must do more to support the recovery.&#34;

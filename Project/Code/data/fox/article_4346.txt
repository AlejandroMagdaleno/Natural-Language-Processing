Sen. Lindsey Graham
, R-S.C., said in an interview that aired Sunday that former President Trump is a unique politician and has the ability to widen the Republican Party’s reach, but can also leave the party in his wake. 
Graham told 
&#34;Axios on HBO&#34;
 that Trump, who many see as the party’s leader, has the ability to make the party &#34;something that nobody else I know can make it.&#34;
SEN. JOSH HAWLEY: DEMOCRATS&#39; POLICIES HAVE FORCED AMERICAN WORKERS TO COMPETE WITH &#39;SLAVE LABOR&#39;
&#34;He can make I bigger; he can make it stronger; he can make it more diverse; and he could destroy it,&#34; he said.
Graham told the news show that it is significant that Trump was able to win the presidency, which was something that Sen. Mitt Romney and the late Sen. John McCain were unable to pull off. He told Axios that Trump has a dark side but alas &#34;there’s some magic there.&#34;

KABC radio host John Phillips and RedState Editor-at-large Kira Davis weigh in on &#39;FOX News Primetime&#39; 
California
 
Gov. Gavin Newsom
 will address the 
Democratic Party
 faithful Saturday as he mounts a campaign to keep his job.
His address to thousands of activists at the 
California
 
Democratic Party&#39;s
 annual convention, held virtually, comes on the heels of state elections officials announcing that a preliminary count shows the recall effort against him has enough signatures to make the ballot.
Voters will get the chance in the all-but-certain election this fall to decide whether the first-term 
Democrat
 should be booted from office before his term ends. Delegates at the convention are some of the party&#39;s most hardworking organizers, who can knock on doors, make phone calls or provide a cheering section at rallies for 
Democratic
 candidates.
&#34;The governor can speak and remind everyone why we supported him to be governor and why he won with an overwhelmingly majority,&#34; said Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, a fellow 
Democrat.
 To the party activists, Republicans are trying to sabotage 
Newsom
 and &#34;that is what will ultimately create the organizational support to defeat the recall.&#34;
CALIFORNIA PLANS EARLY RELEASE FOR 76,000 PRISON INMATE-- INCLUDING VIOLENT FELONS
Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 also is set to deliver remarks, an exciting moment for 
Democrats
 who helped her rise through 
California&#39;s
 political ranks, from San Francisco district attorney to state attorney general to U.S. senator, before she was chosen by Joe Biden for his presidential ticket.
The annual gathering, which began Thursday, serves as a forum to debate policy, endorse candidates and otherwise energize party members. With no other major contests on the state ballot this year, 
Newsom’s
 expected fall recall election will be one of the highest profile races in 
California
 and the nation.
&#34;Being prepared to organize against and defeat a Republican recall of 
Gov. Gavin Newsom
 is going to be an important part of our conversation,&#34; 
California 
Democratic Party
 Chairman Rusty Hicks said of the weekend activities.
Hicks, just reelected as party chair, said the convention will stay focused on 
California&#39;s
 emergence out of the pandemic, including efforts to vaccinate millions of people, get schools reopened and support small businesses.
Newsom&#39;s
 political fate will depend in part on how people feel about his handling of the pandemic and whether schools and businesses remain open by election time.
Republicans have blasted him over school and business closures, though recent polling shows the majority of voters support his handling of schools and the economy.

CALIFORNIA MAYORS WANT $20 BILLION FOR HOMELESS CRISIS OVER NEXT 5 YEARS
In the recall, voters will be asked two questions: Should 
Newsom
 be recalled and who should replace him? He cannot run on the second ballot. Votes for that question will only be tallied if more than half of voters want Newsom gone.
Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, businessman John Cox, former congressman Doug Ose and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner are among the Republicans running to replace him.
For now 
Democrats
 are united behind Newsom. The governor has depicted the recall as an attack by former President Donald Trump&#39;s supporters on 
California&#39;s
 progressive values, an argument that is proving salient among 
Democrats.
Christine Pelosi, the outgoing chair of the state party&#39;s women&#39;s caucus and the daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said 
Democrats
 are excited to defend the state&#39;s progressive ideals. But she said Democrats have to show people what they are for and stay focused on how they will help people recover from the pandemic.
&#34;Our concern is that people won’t vote if they don’t think we’re speaking to the realities of their lives,&#34; Pelosi said.

Beyond Newsom and 
Harris
, delegates will hear Saturday from former Gov. Jerry Brown, Pelosi, former Sen. Barbara Boxer and Sen. Alex Padilla, who Newsom appointed to replace 
Harris
.
Padilla will be up for election in 2022.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who infrequently attends state party conventions, will not deliver remarks. She&#39;s faced heightened criticism and scrutiny about her fitness for office and she&#39;s never been beloved by the party&#39;s progressive activists. In 2018, they endorsed her challenger.

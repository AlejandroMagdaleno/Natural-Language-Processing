Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on how the defund the police movement has divided Democrats.
Rep. Cori Bush&#39;s outpouring of gifts from constituents, including jewelry and dresses, raises &#34;red flags&#34; with ethics rules, a watchdog told Fox News.
In a recent profile in Harpers Bazaar magazine, titled the &#34;
Might of Cori Bush
,&#34; Bush&#39;s father said the 
Missouri
 Democrat regularly receives gifts from grateful constituents so she can &#34;look her best&#34; in Washington. 
&#34;Throughout the general election, she posted videos of herself in the clothes she proudly wore: formfitting dresses, leggings, and tall boots,&#34; reporter Kaitlyn Greenidge wrote in the profile. &#34;Her father tells me that people in the neighborhood now regularly drop off dresses, jewelry and shoes for her to wear in Washington. &#39;They say, &#39;We want her to look her best. She&#39;s representing us.&#39;&#34;
But a watchdog told Fox News that this scenario is problematic since ethics rules strictly prohibit House members from taking gifts valued at more than $50.

‘SQUAD’ MEMBER CORI BUSH, A ‘DEFUND THE POLICE’ ADVOCATE, RECENTLY SPENT $70,000 ON PRIVATE SECURITY
&#34;The gift rule is very strict and it exists to prevent outright corruption, but also to prevent buying access or implicit bias that could come even from small gifts,&#34; Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust president Kendra Arnold told Fox News.
&#34;House members can&#39;t accept anything worth $50 or above unless one of the specific exceptions in the ethics rules allows for it,&#34; Arnold said. &#34;When a member receives benefits or items free of charge based upon their position, it raises red flags.&#34;
&#34;If a member receives something but promptly returns it without using it, that does not constitute a gift and is the proper way to handle an unsolicited gift,&#34; Arnold concluded.
Bush&#39;s office told Fox News that she appreciates the generous support from residents in her district and consults with the ethics committee.
&#34;The congresswoman has received and been immensely grateful for an outpouring of support from her St. Louis community,&#34; Julia Albertson, Bush&#39;s communications director, said. 
&#34;Our office also works very closely with the House Committee on Ethics on all gift-related matters,&#34; Albertson added. &#34;She has never solicited or accepted any gifts that do not strictly comply with House ethics guidelines.&#34; 
The House Committee on Ethics said it could not comment when asked if it could verify whether a member was working with the committee on such matters.

Two conservative watchdog groups filed ethics complaints against Ocasio-Cortez following the event. 
One of the complaints, filed by the National Legal and Policy Center to the Office of Congressional Ethics, alleged that she had improperly accepted tickets from a table sponsor for herself and her boyfriend, the 
New York Post
 reported.

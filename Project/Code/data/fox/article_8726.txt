U.S. Sen. 
Ted Cruz
 on Friday mockingly said he wears former House Speaker 
John Boehner
’s &#34;drunken, bloviated scorn&#34; proudly after Boehner’s latest cutting remark about the Texas Republican.
&#34;The Swamp is unhappy,&#34; Cruz tweeted along with a clip from an upcoming CBS News interview with Boehner in which he calls Cruz a &#34;jerk&#34; and accuses him of &#34;making a lot of noise&#34; but not being especially productive in Congress.
&#34;I wear with pride his drunken, bloviated scorn. Please don’t cry,&#34; Cruz joked in reference to occasions when Boehner became publicly emotional during his career. 
In the interview, Boehner says he doesn’t like to &#34;beat anyone up&#34; but he’d make an exception for Cruz.
&#34;Perfect symbol, you know, of getting elected, making a lot of noise, draw a lot of attention to yourself, raise a lot of money, which means you’re gonna go make more noise, raise more money,&#34; Boehner told CBS of how he views Cruz’s political career.  
BOEHNER TELLS CRUZ TO &#39;GO F- YOURSELF&#39; WHILE RECORDING AUDIO BOOK: REPORT
Boehner, an Ohio Republican who served as House speaker from 2011-2015, has been making the interview rounds promoting his 
book, 
&#34;On The House: A Washington Memoir,&#34; which comes out next week. Boehner represented Ohio&#39;s 8th Congressional District from 1991-2015.
The ex-speaker has taken several shots at Cruz, including while recording his audiobook when he reportedly 
told Cruz to &#34;f---&#34; himself 
in several off-script moments.
Cruz made a joke of it at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Florida in February, saying, &#34;John Boehner made some news. He suggested that I do something that was anatomically impossible. To which my response was, &#39;Who’s John Boehner?&#39;&#34; according to 
The Hill.

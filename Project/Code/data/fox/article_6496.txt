FOX News national correspondent Bryan Llenas joins &#39;America Reports&#39; with the details
New York
 Attorney General 
Letitia James
 said Thursday that the state legislature’s newly launched 
impeachment inquiry
 into multiple sexual misconduct allegations against Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 and his office&#39;s handling of 
COVID-19
 nursing home deaths would not affect her office&#39;s independent investigation of the claims.
&#34;Today’s action by the New York state legislature will have no bearing on our independent investigation into these allegations against Governor Cuomo. Our investigation will continue,&#34; James said in a statement.
On Monday, the attorney general’s office announced Joon H. Kim, a former acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and employment discrimination attorney Anne L. Clark will lead the independent investigation into the state’s three-term Democratic governor. They will be assisted by three other lawyers: Jennifer Kennedy Park, Abena Mainoo, and Yannick Grant.
James&#39; office
 was given full control over the investigation earlier this month. 
NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY TAKING &#39;FIRST STEP&#39; TO IMPEACHING CUOMO 
Cuomo has been accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate touching by six women, including an unnamed aide who claimed she was 
groped underneath her blouse last year
 in the governor’s mansion.
Democrats in the State Assembly opened the impeachment inquiry Thursday, which will investigate the harassment claims as well as alleged undercounting of nursing home deaths during the 
coronavirus
 pandemic.
&#34;The reports of accusations concerning the governor are serious,&#34; State Assembly speaker Carl E. Heastie, a Democrat, said in a statement after authorizing the judiciary committee to open an investigation, according to 
The New York Times
.
Dozens of Democratic state lawmakers have also called on the governor to resign.

Cuomo has said he won’t resign and denies any inappropriate touching but has apologized for making any of the women feel &#34;uncomfortable&#34; and for any &#34;pain&#34; he’s caused.

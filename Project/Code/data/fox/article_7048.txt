The Democrat governor &#39;is in real trouble,&#39; recall activist Tom Del Beccaro says
House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 Thursday said she&#39;s activated her political operation to help California Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
 stay in office and expressed confidence the recall effort against him will fail.
Pelosi, D-Calif., said she&#39;s working at the grassroots level to turn out the vote in 
California
 ahead of the Sept. 14 election. 
PELOSI SAYS NEWSOM RECALL IS &#39;NOT GOOD FOR CHILDREN AND OTHER LIVING THINGS&#39;
&#34;We respect it,&#34; Pelosi said Thursday of the recall effort against the Democratic governor. &#34;But we do not like it, and we will defeat it.&#34;
Californians are faced with two questions on their ballots: Should Newsom be recalled, and who should replace Newsom if he is removed? There are 46 candidates vying to succeed Newsom, and the governor urged his supporters this week to leave that question blank and just focus on voting &#34;no&#34; on the recall.
PELOSI ANNOUNCES HOUSE STAFF CAN MAKE MORE MONEY THAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
During an event Thursday with Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., on the Child Tax Credit, Pelosi said many of Newsom&#39;s initiatives have &#34;alleviated&#34; the pain of coronavirus pandemic, and she urged Californians to rally behind him.
&#34;I want everybody to get out the vote,&#34; Pelosi said. &#34;I have my own operation working to get out the vote [and] making calls to defeat the recall of our governor.&#34;

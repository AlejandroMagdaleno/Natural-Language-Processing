House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 tried to sabotage the rollout of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&#39;s 
Green New Deal
 in 2019 because she was &#34;anxious about the new congresswoman&#39;s notoriety becoming actual power,&#34; according to a new book about insider Democrat politics obtained by Fox News, although Pelosi&#39;s office is pushing back against the claim.
&#34;In February 2019, Pelosi called [Massachusetts Sen.] Ed Markey the night before he was scheduled to help roll out the Green New Deal. She asked him to hold off. She wanted more substantive policy. The politics weren&#39;t good right then. Don’t give the platform to Ocasio-Cortez, she urged, anxious about the new congresswoman&#39;s notoriety becoming actual power,&#34; Edward-Isaac Dovere writes in &#34;Battle for the Soul: Inside the Democrats&#39; Campaigns to Defeat Trump.&#34;

Markey was among the progressives who unveiled Green New Deal legislation in February 2019. 
Pelosi&#39;s office pushed back against Dovere&#39;s book.
&#34;This is false. No such call was made,&#34; Pelosi&#39;s spokesman Drew Hammill told Fox News. He added that Pelosi&#39;s team plans to ask Dovere for a correction.
Pelosi made headlines in February 2019 for downplaying the far-reaching proposal.
&#34;It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,&#34; Pelosi told 
Politico
 at the time. &#34;The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they&#39;re for it right?&#34;

The Green New Deal rollout formally outlined the proposal in 
Congress
 for the first time and would mark a start on the path toward what Ocasio-Cortez called &#34;a wartime-level, just economic mobilization plan to get to 100% renewable energy.&#34; Cost estimates for the sprawling proposal range into the trillions.
The 
resolution
 said the U.S. &#34;has historically been responsible for a disproportionate amount of greenhouse gas emissions&#34; and calls for the U.S. to take a &#34;leading role in reducing emissions through economic transformation.&#34;
The resolution painted a grim view of present-day America, saying it is &#34;experiencing several related crises,&#34; including declining life expectancy, economic stagnation, erosion of worker bargaining power, increasing income inequality and the exacerbation of &#34;systemic racial, regional, social, environmental and economic injustices.&#34;
The resolution said that &#34;a new national social, industrial and economic mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal&#34; is an opportunity to tackle systemic injustices of minority groups, create millions of high-wage jobs and &#34;provide unprecedented levels of prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States.&#34;

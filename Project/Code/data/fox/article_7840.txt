Gov. Kim Reynolds joins &#39;Fox &amp; Friends&#39; to weigh in on the issues facing President Biden.
Republicans are torching the 
White House
 for claiming 
President Biden
 never &#34;shies away&#34; from questions after he hurried back to Camp David without taking questions following his remarks on the botched 
Afghanistan
 troop withdrawal.
&#34;The president never shies away from questions,&#34; White House communications director Kate Bedingfield claimed in a Friday MSNBC interview. &#34;I&#39;ll let him make a decision on if he&#39;ll take questions this afternoon.&#34;

&#34;But, you saw he did a full sit-down interview on this just yesterday, so he is always willing to take questions,&#34; Bedingfield continued. 
Bedingfield&#39;s claim came as Biden has maintained a remarkably low profile amid the Afghanistan crisis. 
Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., unloaded on the White House for the claim, asking if the administration was &#34;joking.&#34;
&#34;Biden&#39;s taken fewer questions than any recent president,&#34; Hice tweeted Friday. &#34;By this point in their term, Obama had done 113 interviews and Trump 50.&#34;
&#34;Biden?&#34; Hice added. &#34;9.&#34;
&#34;Delusional,&#34; Sen. 
Tom Cotton
, R-Ark., lambasted the claim on Twitter, also calling the top White House communications official’s claim &#34;dishonest.&#34;
&#34;We know President Biden&#39;s been shying away from taking questions, avoiding the press, and focusing on other issues than the pressing situation in Afghanistan,&#34; Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla. tweeted. &#34;But VP 
Harris
 bears responsibility, too. Where is she?&#34;

&#34;Where is the accountability? The transparency?&#34; Cammack added.
The vice president is scheduled to take a trip to Vietnam amid the situation in Afghanistant that critics are likening to the 1975 fall of Saigon.

The &#39;Special Report&#39; All-Star panel weigh in on day two of Senate impeachment trial
Democrats on Wednesday are making their case as to why President Donald Trump should be convicted in his 
impeachment trial
 -- a day after the Senate voted to move ahead with the trial. 
Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., led the opening arguments against Trump, accusing him of inciting a crowd that went on to storm the Capitol -- leaving five people dead.
 If convicted on the charge, Trump could be barred from running for office again in the future.

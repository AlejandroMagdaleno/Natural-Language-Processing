Sen. Ted Cruz,
 R-Texas, took a jab at
 Texas Democrats
 after a group took to Twitter to assemble care packages for lawmakers who&#39;ve decamped in Washington, D.C., in an effort to block GOP-backed voting bills by denying quorum.
The Dallas Democrats said it will be &#34;collecting Dr. Pepper, salsa, hard candy, hairspray, travel toiletries, hand sanitizers, sewing kits, first aid, and/or $ to pay shipping.&#34; The group also posted where it&#39;ll be meeting. 
TEXAS DEMOCRATS TO REMAIN IN WASHINGTON THROUGHOUT SPECIAL SESSION 
Cruz took to Twitter and posted, &#34;No Miller Lite?&#34;

 emerged that showed

Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican,
 told Fox News that these lawmakers 
will be arrested upon their arrival back in the state, which may not be until the current 30-day special session ends in August. Though that would successfully stymie the GOP’s current effort, Abbott has vowed to keep trying until the 2022 elections if necessary.

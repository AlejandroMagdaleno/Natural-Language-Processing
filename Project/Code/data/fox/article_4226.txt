A Republican congressman from 
South Carolina
 wasn’t standing for it on Capitol Hill on Thursday when 
Homeland Security
 Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas tried to defend Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 regarding her absence from the U.S.-
Mexico
 border region.
Mayorkas insisted that Harris has faced &#34;quite unfair&#34; criticism for not visiting the border region in nearly three months as President Biden’s point person on the migrant crisis.
&#34;But she’s laughing at it!&#34; U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, fired back, according to Mediaite.com, apparently referring to March remarks in which Harris 
appeared to brush off criticism against her

KAMALA HARRIS HAS GONE 86 DAYS WITHOUT VISIT TO THE BORDER SINCE BEING TAPPED FOR CRISIS ROLE
&#34;It’s an insult to say that you’re looking at the border wall. … What do you have to look at? You’re not building it,&#34; Norman continued.

      U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., left, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas faced off on Capitol Hill on Thursday.

Mayorkas – who along with Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra have visited the border region while both Harris and President Biden have stayed away -- responded that Harris was &#34;quite familiar with the situation at the border,&#34; having served in the past as attorney general of California,

His answer appeared to echo Harris’ own recent response to NBC News anchor Lester Holt, when he asked the vice president why she hadn’t visited the border region since taking office.
&#34;We’ve been to the border,&#34; Harris claimed, seeming to refer either to her time before the vice presidency, or to border visits by other Biden administration officials. &#34;I – and I haven&#39;t been to Europe. And I mean, I don’t – I don&#39;t understand the point that you&#39;re making.&#34;

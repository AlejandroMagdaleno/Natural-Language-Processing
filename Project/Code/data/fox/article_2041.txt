Washington, D.C. 
Mayor Muriel Bowser
 sparked backlash after posting a photo of herself without a mask indoors while her 
indoor mask mandate
 remains in effect.
The mayor attended a Jack and Jill summit in D.C. Thursday evening to help promote future Black leaders by bringing together children for social events. 
Bowser 
tweeted
 a picture of herself with a group of women at the indoor event and wrote, &#34;Tonight I spoke to students from around the country gathered for the Jack and Jill On the Hill Legislative Summit.&#34;
CRITICS SLAM DC MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER FOR VIOLATING HER OWN MASK MANDATE
&#34;It&#39;s the passion of our youth that gives me hope for the future of DC and our nation,&#34; she added. &#34;Their voices matter, and I will continue to work to give them a #FairShot.&#34;
But the event took second stage for social media followers who noticed that Bowser was forgoing a mask indoors, despite her own indoor mask mandate. 
&#34;No COVID here, move along folks,&#34; one 
social media user
 said in response to the mayor’s photo. 
Another 
follower
 asked, &#34;Hi, who do I call to report a violation of your mask mandate?&#34;
&#34;Indoor mask requirement suspended for 15 minutes? Did everyone else get that memo so they could partake?&#34; a user named 
Laura
 asked. &#34;Why do you not care that exactly THIS is why there is vaccine hesitancy? You’re vaccinated and not worried, so why should ANY vaccinated person be worried about anyone not?&#34;
Dozens of others asked the mayor where her mask was while others 
joked
 about &#34;invisible masks.&#34;
&#34;2 Things missing. No Jack&#39;s and no Masks!&#34; a user with the handle 
MikeLoud
 said.
Several commenters had the mantra &#34;Rules for thee, but not for me&#34; in their posts. 
Fox News could not immediately reach the mayor’s office for comment. 
On July 27, Bowser reinstated a mask mandate for all individuals while indoors in a public setting, including for those who have been fully vaccinated.
The 
mandate
 was based on guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as COVID-19 cases began to spike nationwide with the spread of the delta variant earlier this summer.

&#34;Choosing not to wear a mask puts your own health as well as the health of others at risk,&#34; read the guidelines issued by the mayor’s office. 
The order also noted that &#34;a mask is not a substitute for physical distancing.&#34;
The guidance does not note when the mask order will end in D.C.
Bowser previously faced criticism after being 
spotted without a mask
 at a wedding in D.C.

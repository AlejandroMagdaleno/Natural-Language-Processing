Former Michigan Senate candidate John James on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer getting an award for her coronavirus response.
Former Michigan Senate candidate John James told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
&#34; on Thursday that 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer
 getting an award for her coronavirus response was &#34;politically tone-deaf.&#34; The Republican joked that Whitmer should be in the running for a Florida real estate award as residents flee from &#34;draconian&#34; lockdowns and that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is far more deserving of a leadership award for his handling of the pandemic.
MICHIGAN GOV. WHITMER TO RECEIVE JFK &#39;PROFILE IN COURAGE&#39; AWARD DESPITE RECENT COVID-19 SURGE
JOHN JAMES: I actually understand that this is one of many awards that our governor has been winning recently. I heard that she&#39;s recently won two job creator jobs awards in Ohio and Indiana and the number one real estate developer in Florida. Joking aside, this is a very serious matter. And when you talk about profiles in courage, people who will put themselves in harm&#39;s way to do the right thing versus a politician who maybe is under draconian orders that have sacrificed livelihoods and lives, it looks politically motivated at worst, and tone-deaf at best. 
...
There are a lot of people who are struggling around Michigan. And I think that that&#39;s why we need leaders who have tested leadership experience like Governor Ron DeSantis. Governor Ron DeSantis is a military veteran. He understands what it&#39;s like to make life and death decisions. He&#39;s not one of these other politicians who moved through this COVID crisis, through polling and panic. I believe that we need more leaders like this. And I think that that&#39;s how you prevent this from happening. 
...
In fact, if you want a great recipient candidate for one of these personal courage awards, Governor Ron DeSantis will be on top of most people&#39;s lists, Democrat or Republican. He&#39;s even being acknowledged for his outstanding leadership in his results, which is a stark contrast in Michigan being among the worst recovering states during this covid crisis.

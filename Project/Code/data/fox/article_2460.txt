Cindy McCain tells ‘Outnumbered Overtime’ why she thinks some Republicans crossed over to vote for President-elect Joe Biden.
Cindy McCain, the widow of the late GOP Sen. John McCain, told prospective Arizona 
Republican
 candidates in a tweet that they should questions the 
party&#39;s leadership, philosophy and values
.
The social media post was a direct response to her expected censure by the state Republicans for her supposed ties to leftist, globalist causes and failure to support 
President Trump
 by endorsing President-elect Joe Biden. 
&#34;Time for some soul-searching in the Arizona GOP,&#34; she wrote in a 
tweet
, which included a link to 
The Arizona Republic
PHOENIX MAN IN CAPITOL RIOT DRESSED IN HORNS, BEARSKIN HEADDRESS IS ARRESTED, CHARGED
Arizona, a traditionally red state, played an important role in the 
Democrats&#39;
 victory in the 
U.S. Senate
 and 
Joe Biden&#39;s
 
presidential win
. 
The state&#39;s Republican Party, led by Chairwoman Dr. Kelli Ward, is seeking retribution -- starting with McCain, who 
endorsed the former vice president
 during the election and has since
 joined his transition team advisory board
.
The resolution will be up for consideration at the party&#39;s annual meeting on Jan. 23, according to the 
@AZGOP Twitter account
.
A draft of the text
 lists McCain&#39;s support of gay marriage, 
Biden
 and condemnation of Trump as reasons to &#34;dissolve any connections whatsoever&#34; with McCain, even going as far as to say that McCain acted &#34;in direct opposition to Republican values, the interests of the American people, and the 
Constitution of the United States
.&#34;
McCain&#39;s late husband was not a fan of Trump and vice versa. The two traded blows up until McCain&#39;s 
death in August 2018
.
The state&#39;s party issued a similar denouncement of the senator in 2014, but he went on to 
beat Ward in the 2016 Republican primary
. 
In an 
interview in The Arizona Republic
, one of a handful throughout the course of the last few months, McCain said she was not surprised by the resolution and &#34;continuous insults and personal attacks from Arizona GOP Chairman Kelli Ward.&#34;
McCain said Ward&#39;s assault was politically motivated and her involvement in both Senate elections to replace her husband and former Republican Sen. Jeff Flake &#34;resulted in Democrat wins.&#34; 
&#34;As Chairman of the AZGOP she managed to turn Arizona blue in November for the first time since 1996,&#34; she told the Republic. &#34;Maybe she should be reminded that my husband never lost an Arizona election since his first win in 1982; he and Governor [Doug] Ducey are the last two Republicans to win statewide races in Arizona.&#34;
McCain accused Ward of backing GOP Congressmen 
Paul Gosar
 and 
Andy Biggs
 -- two of the three lawmakers who 
activist Ali Alexander said
 helped organize the 
Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol
. 
In response, state Republican Party spokesman Zachery Henry accused McCain of pushing a &#34;false narrative&#34; about a &#34;perceived grudge&#34; and said that the censure is actually a &#34;tragic indictment by the Republican Party of Arizona at large of her own efforts to campaign for and support left-wing Democratic candidates.&#34;
McCain and the Arizona Republican Party did not immediately return messages from Fox News seeking comment.

The Arizona Republican Party will also meet to consider the censure of Republican Gov. Doug Ducey for his handling of the 
coronavirus pandemic
.
Flake, who faced criticisms similar to those against McCain, was 
successfully censured by Maricopa County Republicans
 earlier this month.
&#34;I&#39;m in good company,&#34; he 
tweeted last week
, referring to McCain.

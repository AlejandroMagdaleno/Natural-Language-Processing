FOX News correspondent Bryan Llenas joins &#39;The Story&#39; with the latest on bombshell allegations
A New York lawmaker took to Twitter late Wednesday to call for an independent investigation into sexual harassment allegations leveled against the 
state’s embattled governor.
Gov. Andrew Cuomo was accused by a former aide, Lindsey Boylan, of orchestrating  a &#34;pervasive&#34; culture of &#34;sexual harassment and bullying.&#34; She posted on 
Medium
 that Cuomo once suggested that they play &#34;strip poker&#34; during a flight in October 2017 and said he once kissed her on the lips.

&#34;The idea that someone might think I held my high-ranking position because of the Governor’s ‘crush’ on me was more demeaning than the kiss itself,&#34; she posted.
Boylan, a Democrat running for Manhattan borough president, said that during her more than three years in the Democrat’s administration, Cuomo &#34;would go out of his way to touch me on my lower back, arms and legs.&#34;
Cuomo’s office denied the allegations as &#34;simply false.&#34;
Assemblywoman Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, a Democrat from Queens, called the allegations &#34;abhorrent and heartbreaking.&#34;

&#34;We must hold even the highest officials of our state accountable if we expect to restore the public’s trust,&#34; she posted. She also called for new legislation to discourage harassment.

Boyland attributed her decision to say more to

 against two-term GOP 
Sen. John Boozman

And taking aim at Boozman without naming him, he argued that &#34;also part of the problem are the career politicians in the Republican Party who simply refuse to stand up and fight for what&#39;s right. I&#39;m not a career politician, OK? I&#39;m an outsider. I&#39;m a conservative. I&#39;m a veteran.&#34;

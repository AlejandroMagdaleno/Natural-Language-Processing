 alleged in a Twitter post on Monday night that the death of Daunte Wright &#34;wasn’t an accident&#34; as she appeared to call for an end of policing.

Her comments were posted in the aftermath of the death of Daunte Wright, a 20-year old Black man, at the hands of police at a routine traffic stop in Minnesota over the weekend.
The officer who shot Wright was described as a senior member of the force.
Released body camera footage appears to show the officer yelling &#34;Taser,&#34; which has led the officials to characterize the shooting as an &#34;accidental discharge&#34; after it was believed the officer meant to grab a Taser but instead fired her gun.
Wright drove off, crashed and died. He had been stopped for having expired tags on his car and he is also said to have had an outstanding warrant.
The officer has been put on administrative leave.

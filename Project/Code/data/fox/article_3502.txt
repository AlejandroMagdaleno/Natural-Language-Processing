West Virginia Attorney general Patrick Morrisey on 20 Republican state Attorney Generals slamming the Democrats’ voting reform bill. 
The massive 
election
 reform measure that 
House Democrats
 passed this week is &#34;welfare for politicians&#34; and &#34;seeks to undermine voter ID laws,&#34; among other &#34;dangerous and unconstitutional&#34; measures, West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey told &#34;
America Reports
&#34; on Friday.
Morrisey recently joined 20 Republican state attorneys general in signing a letter denouncing the &#34;For the People Act&#34; hours before it passed the House Wednesday. The measure aims to expand access to the polls, fight partisan gerrymandering and set up 
new public funding
 for congressional races.
MORRISEY: This is a very dangerous bill, and at its core, this is a major power grab by Congress and by Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi. If you look at the Constitution, the Constitution lays out how elections are going to be set forth. There&#39;s obviously some role for the federal government in a number of the elections. There&#39;s a primary role for the state government. This bill is trying to wipe out a significant amount of the state&#39;s role in managing elections. What is that going to do? Number one, it&#39;s going to undermine voter ID, which I think is critical, and it helps to reduce fraud. It&#39;s in place in 35 states.
..
Number two, it&#39;s actually going to limit the state&#39;s ability to take inactive voters off the rolls once again, to provide more confidence to the American public that people who shouldn&#39;t be voting aren&#39;t actually getting to the polls if they&#39;re ineligible. And it also will chill free speech. This is welfare for politicians. It should not pass the U.S. Senate. If it does, I&#39;m prepared to file a lawsuit to make sure that this unconstitutional legislation is struck down.&#34;
20 STATE AGS DENOUNCE DEMOCRATS&#39; H.R. 1 AS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
The 
For the People Act of 2021
, known as H.R. 1, passed by a vote of 220 to 210. No Republicans supported the bill.

House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
, D-Calif., said the legislation is needed to combat voter suppression efforts, to crack down on corruption and to diminish the influence of big money in politics. 
&#34;This is called the &#39;For The People bill,&#39;&#34; Pelosi said Wednesday. &#34;And in [passing it], we combat big, dark, special- nterest money in politics and amplify the voice of the American people.&#34;

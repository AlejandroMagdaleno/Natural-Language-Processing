More than two dozen protesters arrested; Ellison Barber reports.
A left-wing group is planning a protest next week outside of 
Supreme Court
 Justice Brett Kavanaugh&#39;s home in reaction to his decision to dismiss a challenge to Texas&#39; controversial 
abortion
 law. 
&#34;Brett Kavanaugh: You&#39;re going to hear from us directly,&#34; reads a Facebook event from 
ShutDownDC
. The group says they&#39;ll use Monday&#39;s event to tell him to &#34;keep your oppressive&#34; ideology &#34;out of our bodies&#34; and demand his resignation.
The Supreme Court&#39;s public information office did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.
ShutDownDC suggested Kavanaugh&#39;s decision was predictable and an affront to &#34;reproductive justice.&#34;
WHAT IS SHUTDOWNDC? THEY SAY THEY OPPOSE OPPRESSION, BUT SEN. HAWLEY DUBS THEM ANTIFA SCUMBAGS
&#34;Three years ago, hundreds of women, femmes, and allies undertook a month of bold direct action to stop the Senate from confirming accused sexual predator Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,&#34; he said. 
&#34;We warned what would happen. And now, in the dead of night, Kavanaugh and four of his colleagues have effectively overturned the right to an abortion. (Although we must acknowledge that the right wing had already succeeded in making abortion largely inaccessible for many people without means and people of color living in certain states.)&#34;
Although the Supreme Court didn&#39;t overturn Roe v. Wade, many have worried about the implications of its recent decision. It effectively allowed a ban on abortions after the point at which a fetal heartbeat can be detected, generally considered to be around six weeks.
&#34;Make no mistake, what&#39;s happening to reproductive justice and abortion rights is far bigger than one person. But Kavanaugh is playing a key role, and so far he&#39;s been protected from any backlash. No more.&#34;
JOSH HAWLEY&#39;S WIFE FILES CRIMINAL COMPLAINT AFTER VIRGINIA PROTEST OUTSIDE COUPLE&#39;S HOME
Judicial Crisis Network President Carrie Severino told Fox News that the protest followed a pattern of intimidating behavior on the left. &#34;By personally threatening Justice Kavanaugh and his family, the Left is resorting to its favorite tactic: intimidating the Court,&#34; said Severino, a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas who also helped push Kavanaugh&#39;s confirmation.
She added that &#34;the Left&#39;s objective is always to bully the Court into delivering the liberal policies that left-wing dark money groups demand.&#34;
Kavanaugh is the latest of many public figures to encounter backlash from ShutDownDC. The also 
protested
 outside of former Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf&#39;s home last year. They also claim to have held a vigil outside of Sen. Josh Hawley&#39;s Missouri home in January.
Hawley&#39;s wife, Erin, reportedly filed a criminal complaint against the group, which was charged with illegal protesting.
Erin Hawley and the couple&#39;s infant daughter Abigail were home during the protest, while the senator and the couple&#39;s two sons were back in Missouri, the Kansas City (Mo.) Star reported.
The Missouri senator described the protesters as &#34;Antifa scumbags&#34; and accused them of vandalizing his house.

On its website, ShutDownDC defended its actions. &#34;While we certainly cannot comment on any potentially pending criminal case, we believe it is outrageous that rich and powerful people – a United States Senator and his family – might attempt to silence peaceful citizens’ exercise of their First Amendment rights,&#34; a 
post read
.
&#34;Senator Hawley’s lies, both about the election and the candlelight vigil at his home, are dangerous and damaging to our democracy … These potential allegations are merely a false flag, intended to distract the public from Senator Hawley’s unconscionable behavior.

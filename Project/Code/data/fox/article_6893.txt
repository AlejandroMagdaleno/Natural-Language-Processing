An 
Ohio
 police officer has died after a shooting standoff with a suspect, the Toledo 
Police Department
 said Monday.
Chief George Kral identified the officer as 24-year-old Brandon Stalker. According to Kral, Stalker was hit once by the suspect, who brandished two firearms while leaving a house which he entered after an exchange with police.
&#34;This is a very dark and horrific day for the city of Toledo,&#34; Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz said at the press conference.
At around 3:53 p.m. ET, officers noticed the suspect, wanted in an earlier vandalization and arson at a city cathedral, having a cigarette on Fulton Street.
According to 
abc13
, the historic Rosary Cathedral was vandalized with graffiti that read &#34;Jesus is Black&#34; and &#34;Black Jesus.&#34; The damage was reportedly estimated to cost $5,100. Kral said police had warrants out for the suspect.

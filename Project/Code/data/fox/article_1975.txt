Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas appears before House Homeland Security Committee to discuss border, other concerns.
Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas got into a tense exchange over the migrant surge at the southern border, with the DHS chief calling a question by the congresswoman &#34;extraordinarily disrespectful.&#34;
Mayorkas was in the hot seat during a Wednesday House Committee on Homeland Security hearing entitled &#34;The Way Forward on Homeland Security.&#34; Cammack used her time to grill the secretary over the migrant crisis at the border. 
&#34;I just want to bring it home a little bit,&#34; said the Florida congresswoman about the border crisis. &#34;See, I’m from a small town out West and the month before I was supposed to graduate high school – which was 2006 – one of my classmates was kidnapped by an illegal who had been deported multiple times.&#34;
Cammack said she believes that when there are &#34;policies&#34; that &#34;incentivize&#34; illegal immigration and there are not &#34;proper mechanisms in place to protect our borders,&#34; the &#34;impact&#34; would have &#34;resounding effects.&#34;
The Florida congresswoman then asked &#34;how many more&#34; people like her friend &#34;have to be kidnapped across America&#34; before Mayorkas decides to &#34;take action.&#34;
FOUR MIGRANTS WITH NAMES ON TERROR WATCH LIST PICKED UP AT BORDER SINCE OCTOBER
Mayorkas responded to Cammack, saying that he found the Florida congresswoman’s question to be &#34;extraordinarily disrespectful.&#34;
&#34;Disrespectful not only to me, but disrespectful to the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security and to all the front-line personnel across this country who dedicate themselves to the safety and security of the American people,&#34; Mayorkas continued.
&#34;I’m sorry that you feel that way,&#34; Cammack fired back. &#34;I’m sure the American people feel very disrespected about the border situation they’re facing right now.&#34;
Earlier in the exchange, the congresswoman asked Mayorkas if &#34;it would stand to reason&#34; that the country was in an &#34;emergency&#34; since the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) had been deployed to the border.
Mayorkas said the agency was &#34;tackling&#34; the &#34;very serious challenge&#34; at the U.S.-Mexico border, but refused to call it an &#34;emergency.&#34;
&#34;So, FEMA being the emergency management administration, they deal with emergencies and they are now being deployed to the border,&#34; said Cammack. &#34;And it’s not an emergency? Is that what I’m hearing?&#34;
BIDEN TELLS MIGRANTS ‘DON’T COME’ TO US AS BORDER CRISIS SURGES
Mayorkas responded that &#34;the men and women of FEMA have tremendous operational capabilities&#34; to deal with the &#34;challenges&#34; that come up in missions.
The tense exchange came as the Biden administration faces down a growing crisis at the southern border – a situation the president and his homeland security chief refuse to call a &#34;crisis.&#34;

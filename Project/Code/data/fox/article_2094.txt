Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on prepping tax hikes to fuel the next spending plan.
Transportation Secretary 
Pete Buttigieg
 on Sunday said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&#39;s demand for a $10 trillion infrastructure spending package is a &#34;natural part&#34; of the debate over President Biden&#39;s $2 trillion-plus spending proposal. 
ABC&#39;s &#34;This Week&#34; host George Stephanopoulos asked Buttigieg to respond to progressives like Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who believe Biden&#39;s &#34;American Jobs Plan&#34; is not bold enough.
Buttigieg said both sides of the aisle have lodged objections over its price tag and scope, and that those differences are a &#34;natural part&#34; of the conversation.
Buttigieg then said the massive proposal is the &#34;biggest investment in American job creation&#34; since World War II, calling it a &#34;huge deal.&#34; He claimed that the spending plan will replace or improve 10,000 bridges, provide broadband to all Americans and create 19 million jobs.

AOC SLAMS BIDEN&#39;S $2.2T INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE: &#39;NOT NEARLY ENOUGH&#39;
Ocasio-Cortez 
reacted
 to Biden&#39;s infrastructure proposal last week, saying it &#34;needs to be way bigger.&#34; During a recent appearance on MSNBC, Ocasio-Cortez 
told
 host Rachel Maddow that the House should &#34;absolutely&#34; increase the scope of the package before it is sent to the Senate.
&#34;If we could wave a magic wand, and progressives in the House were able to name any number and get it through — which obviously isn&#39;t the case, but if we&#39;re looking at ideals ... we&#39;re talking about, realistically, $10 trillion over 10 years,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez said.
REPUBLICAN SENATORS LINE UP AGAINST BIDEN&#39;S MASSIVE $2T SPENDING BILL: &#39;FAR CRY&#39; FROM INFRASTRUCTURE
Republican senators are loudly 
voicing their opposition
 to Biden&#39;s proposal, including moderate Republicans who attempted to work with the Biden administration on the coronavirus stimulus bill.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., expressed concerns last week that Biden&#39;s proposal would add trillions to the national debt. He also said it addresses far more than infrastructure, despite the White House selling it as an infrastructure plan.

&#34;It contains sweeping far-left priorities like attacking blue-collar Americans’ right-to-work protections, a huge favor to big labor bosses,&#34; McConnell said.

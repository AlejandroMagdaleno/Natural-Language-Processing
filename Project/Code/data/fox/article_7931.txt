Wisconsin Republican says the president&#39;s bill is &#39;mortgaging our children&#39;s future&#39; on &#39;The Story&#39;
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told &#34;
The Story
&#34; Tuesday that the 
Biden
 administration is &#34;mortgaging our children’s future&#34; by driving up debt to pay for a proposed 
infrastructure bill.
 
JOHNSON: They [the Biden administration] are enacting a radical, 100% partisan agenda, and
 it&#39;s going to bankrupt this nation. When I came to Congress in 2001, we were $14 trillion in debt. Now we&#39;re $28 trillion in debt and this doesn&#39;t include $1.9 trillion they passed for the COVID relief bill. Now they are talking about over $2 trillion for an infrastructure bill, probably 5% of it is for roads and bridges. No more than 20% is for] what most people define as true infrastructure. The rest is going to be spent in not a very productive way from my standpoint.
Everybody loves free money.
 I realize that’s a very bipartisan thing to support, but the problem is we’re $28 trillion in debt. We don&#39;t have an unlimited checking account. We are mortgaging our children’s future. I think it&#39;s immoral. Nobody knows where this money gets spent. Remember, President Obama had the $800 billion stimulus, probably no more than $100 billion went to infrastructure. Those projects weren&#39;t all that shovel-ready. So this money will be frittered away and added to the debt burden of our children.
It&#39;s entirely possible [Democrats and Republicans come together] if it&#39;s [the infrastructure bill]
 reasonable, if we know exactly where the money is going to be spent, if it&#39;s spent on real infrastructure, places where it&#39;s needed and paid for with user fees and toll roads. There are a host of ways of paying for this. If you are going to borrow money, if you&#39;re borrowing money on real infrastructure that will last for twenty, thirty, forty years, that makes sense. The problem is we have already committed to borrowing about $6 trillion since the COVID recession began and there&#39;s no end in sight. It&#39;s completely irresponsible.

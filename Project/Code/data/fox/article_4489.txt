Fox &amp; Friends Weekend co-host Pete Hegseth weighs in on South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem&#39;s lawsuit against the Biden administration, calls for an investigation into the allegations against John Kerry and the latest news on Hunter Biden.
South Dakota Gov. 
Kristi Noem
&#39;s decision to wave an 
American flag
 in a parade (in a picture that went viral on Saturday) explained why the Taliban is winning in 
Afghanistan
, one Harvard professor claimed on Twitter. 
Tom Nichols, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College and at the Harvard Extension School who writes for USA Today and The Atlantic, claimed that Noem&#39;s American flag parade was &#34;unserious, self-destructive, faux patriotic.&#34;
Nichols posted a picture of Noem&#39;s parade – which took place on Monday, August 9, but which resurfaced on Twitter on Saturday – with the caption, &#34;Meanwhile, as Kabul falls.&#34; He deleted the tweet, but then reposted it, explaining his reasoning.
&#34;I deleted this because it was too short. I wanted to make the point even more directly, as I did here. A charlatan like Noem riding through a superspreader event with a flag while Kabul falls is America, 2021: Unserious, self-destructive, faux patriotic,&#34; Nichols claimed.

&#34;How does something like Kabul happen? It happens when you are no longer a serious country - when you cannot even deal with a pandemic and you think this nitwit waving a flag is a great idea. This is not a public that will engage in reasoned debate about the future of Afghanistan,&#34; the professor argued.
Sal LaBarbera
, a retired 33-year veteran of the Los Angles Police Department, mocked Nichols&#39; take.
&#34;Yes the governor of a state can take care of foreign affairs,&#34; LaBarbera tweeted, sarcastically. &#34;Our president is asleep our southern border is wide open. Great observation Tom.&#34;
Andrew Follett, a senior analyst at the conservative organization Club for Growth, responded to Nichols by noting that President Biden went on vacation this weekend.

Gov. Noem&#39;s office told Fox News that the governor carried the flag on horseback on August 9. She auctioned off a painting of herself on horseback and the American flag that she carried. The auction supported Treasured Lives, an organization that helps victims of sex trafficking. The painting sold for $55,000 and the flag for $25,000.

Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr was one of the 14 state attorneys general who wrote a letter to President Biden, calling for a reversal on the cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline project. 
Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr argued on &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
&#34; on Thursday that 
President Biden&#39;s
 move to cancel the 
Keystone XL oil pipeline project
 was a &#34;political reward for those that supported the Biden-Harris administration.&#34;
He also warned the &#34;political symbolism&#34; of cancelling the project will have a &#34;real-world impact.&#34; 
Carr was one of the 14 state attorneys general who 
wrote a letter
 to President Biden on Tuesday, calling for a reversal of the cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipeline project. The group accused the president of a &#34;unilateral and rushed decision to revoke the 2019 Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.&#34;
AFL-CIO PRESIDENT&#39;S REACTION TO KEYSTONE XL SHUTDOWN SHOWS DIVIDE BETWEEN UNION LEADERSHIP, MEMBERS: EXPERTS
The 
letter 
warns that Biden’s &#34;decision will result in devastating damage to many of our states and local communities.&#34; 
In a series of orders aimed at combating 
climate change,
 President Biden revoked the permit for the 1,700-mile pipeline on his first day in office, ending a project that was expected to employ more than 
11,000
 Americans this year. 
Carr said he was &#34;concerned&#34; and explained that he believes a consequence will be &#34;higher fuel costs for families and for businesses in
 Georgia
 and around the country.&#34; He also stressed that the move will &#34;disrupt industries like agriculture, which is our number one industry in Georgia, and manufacturing and consumer products.&#34; 
&#34;But the biggest impact it’s going to have is on the jobs that were going to be created by this particular project,&#34; Carr continued, noting that that would include &#34;10,000 construction jobs.&#34; 
&#34;That&#39;s families that are going to be devastated by the decision to pull this permit,&#34; he stressed. 
He added that &#34;this is an issue where we in the United States have done a great job of becoming more energy independent and if this pipeline gets shut down, instead of dealing with one of our great allies and trading partners in 
Canada
, we&#39;re going to be relying more on crude oil from 
Russia
 and from 
Venezuela 
and from the 
Middle East.
&#34;
Carr said that Biden’s move to halt the project &#34;doesn&#39;t make any sense to me&#34; because &#34;this is going to impact folks here at home, real families, real jobs.&#34;
In 
remarks
 made by Biden last month before signing executive actions on tackling climate change, the president pointed to &#34;a key plank&#34; of his
 Build Back Better Recovery Plan,
 which he noted &#34;is building a modern, resilient climate infrastructure and clean energy future that will create millions of good-paying union jobs.&#34;
&#34;What they&#39;re talking about is theoretical jobs that they haven&#39;t produced, they have no plan for,&#34; Carr said on Thursday.  
He then pointed out that the Keystone XL oil pipeline project &#34;was a safe, reliable project that was going to employ people now.&#34;

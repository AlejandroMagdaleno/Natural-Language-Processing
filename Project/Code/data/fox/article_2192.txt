Jody Jones calls on Biden to fix immigration policy during an appearance on ‘Fox &amp;amp; Friends.’
A 
California
 man whose brother was killed by an 
illegal immigrant
 slammed the 
Biden
 administration for refusing to admit that there is a crisis at the southern 
border
 and said the situation is getting worse by the minute.
&#34;If it walks like a duck, talks like a duck, it’s not a cow, it’s a duck,&#34; Jody Jones said. &#34;So don’t sit there and tell me there’s not a crisis down at the border, because there is.&#34;
During an appearance on 
&#34;Fox &amp; Friends,&#34;
 Jones said that the influx of migrants is &#34;destroying&#34; communities in California, with border crossings in the month of March hitting 
historic levels.
He added that the administration’s policies have driven a wedge between local 
law enforcement
 and immigration officers, making it difficult for them to communicate.
SOTU GUEST WHOSE BROTHER WAS MURDERED: PELOSI &#39;RIPPED OUR HEARTS OUT&#39; WITH HER ACTIONS
&#34;All you hear is law enforcement agencies screaming for help and there’s nothing being done,&#34; Jones said. 
Jones claimed that recently proposed legislation in the state of California, specifically bill 
AB 937,
 would essentially make it nearly &#34;impossible&#34; to deport illegal immigrant felons.
&#34;These illegal immigrants are committing crimes—felonies. Getting caught with pounds methamphetamines, weapons on them, firearms, nothing’s happening to them. I mean they’re doing literally hours in jail and getting released,&#34; Jones said.
&#34;When you’re protecting [illegal immigrants] you stop protecting our community.&#34;
Jones&#39; eldest brother, Rocky Jones, was shot and killed at a Tulare County gas station in 2018. He was 51.

&#34;He was murdered by Gustavo Garcia,&#34; Jones said. &#34;He was an illegal immigrant. He was a criminal. He was deported twice before. The second time, he actually did federal time. He was arrested two days prior for being under the influence.&#34;
Jones said that because the last arrest only warranted a misdemeanor charge in California, the county sheriff&#39;s department released Garcia within 10 hours.
Two days later, Garcia went on a &#34;reign of terror,&#34; killing Rocky and several others.

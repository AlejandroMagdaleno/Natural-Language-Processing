Denmark’s
 intelligence service worked with its U.S. counterpart to collect information on European leaders including 
German
 Chancellor 
Angela Merkel
, according to several reports in Danish media. 
According to Danmarks Radio (DR), the Danish foreign secret service helped the U.S. collect intelligence on European leaders, including Merkel, from 2012 to 2014 under the codename &#34;Operation Dunhammer.&#34; 
Efforts by the U.S. government to collect such intelligence during that timeframe were previously reported. But the role of Denmark&#39;s Defense Intelligence Service, known in Denmark by its acronym FE, was not previously known.
The U.S. National Security Agency reportedly worked with FE to gain access to text messages and phone calls with officials from European countries.

A Danish lawmaker in the left-wing Socialist People&#39;s Party said that he plans to press Denmark&#39;s defense and justice ministers on the alleged assistance to the United States&#39; spying efforts. 
&#34;The government must explain how come Denmark has been acting as a willing tool for a U.S. intelligence service, and what it will mean for cooperation with Denmark’s neighboring countries,&#34; that lawmaker, Karsten Hoenge, said.

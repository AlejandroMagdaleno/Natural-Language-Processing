Texas senator joins &#39;Hannity&#39; to discuss what he saw on his trip to the border
Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y., is condemning the use of the term &#34;surge&#34; when discussing the ongoing border crisis at the southern border. 
&#34;They wanna say, &#39;But what about the surge?&#39;&#34; Ocasio-Cortez said on Tuesday night during an Instagram Live session. &#34;Well, first of all, just gut check, stop. Anyone who&#39;s using the term &#39;surge&#39; around you consciously is trying to invoke a militaristic frame.&#34;

, &#34;Yes, there are kids here, often by themselves. It’s emotionally taxing to see that night after night because God only knows what they’ve been through. Funny how AOC raced down to TX for the winter storm but she can’t be bothered to come down now to see what’s happening.&#34;

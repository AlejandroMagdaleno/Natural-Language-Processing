House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
, D-Calif., on Sunday insisted that the Jan. 6 select committee should have &#34;no partisanship,&#34; despite rejecting two Republican House members this past week.
During an interview on ABC&#39;s 
&#34;This Week,&#34;
 Pelosi told anchor George Stephanopoulos that she believes that the only way the committee can &#34;retain the confidence of the American people&#34; is through &#34;no partisanship&#34; and &#34;patriotism.&#34;
AP REPORTER PUTS BLAME ON GOP, SUPPORTS DEMS, PELOSI IN JAN. 6 COMMITTEE CHAOS
&#34;We have to, again, ignore the antics of those who do not want to find the truth,&#34; Pelosi said. &#34;We will find the truth. That truth will have the confidence of the American people because it will be done patriotically and not in a partisan way.&#34;
Stephanopoulos followed up to ask Pelosi whether she will be appoint Republicans like Rep. 
Adam Kinzinger
, R-Ill., prompting her to say, &#34;That&#39;s my plan.&#34; When asked about the announcement, Pelosi said that &#34;perhaps&#34; she will make an announcement after she talks to the Illinois Republican.
On Wednesday, Pelosi 
announced
 she was rejecting Reps. 
Jim Jordan
 from Ohio and 
Jim Banks
 from Indiana – two strong allies of former President Donald Trump – from joining the Jan. 6 committee due to past statements that she claims will hurt the &#34;integrity of the investigation.&#34;
PELOSI BANS GOP REPS. JIM JORDAN, JIM BANKS FROM SERVING ON JAN. 6 COMMITTEE, MCCARTHY THREATENS TOTAL BOYCOTT
&#34;With respect for the integrity of the investigation, with an insistence on the truth and with concern about statements made and actions taken by these Members, I must reject the recommendations of Representatives Banks and Jordan to the Select Committee,&#34; Pelosi said in a statement. &#34;The unprecedented nature of January 6th demands this unprecedented decision.&#34;
Pelosi&#39;s decision immediately sparked backlash from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who threatened a Republican boycott of the committee over the &#34;unprecedented&#34; decision.
&#34;Unless Speaker Pelosi reverses course and seats all five Republican nominees, Republicans will not be party to their sham process and will instead pursue our own investigation of the facts,&#34; McCarthy said in a statement.

Jordan said Pelosi&#39;s Jan. 6 committee is &#34;nothing more than a partisan political charade&#34; and Banks said it is &#34;purely partisan exercise by the Democrats.&#34;

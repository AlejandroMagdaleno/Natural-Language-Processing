Senate Energy Committee GOP member Steve Daines argues President Biden&#39;s &#39;outrageous&#39; decision yields to the Democrat Party&#39;s &#39;far-left radical extremists&#39; and hurts the pocketbooks of the American people.
Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., believes 
President Biden
 killing the 
Keystone XL pipeline
 shows he’s putting &#34;Saudi Arabia first,&#34; not American workers.
&#34;It looks like he cares more about workers in Saudi Arabia than the 
workers
 in America,&#34; Daines said on &#34;
America&#39;s Newsroom
.&#34; 
&#34;This is going to have a direct effect [on] the pocketbooks of the American people here in the middle of a pandemic.&#34;
OBAMA PRAISES BIDEN&#39;S EXECUTIVE ORDER BLITZ: &#39;THIS IS A TIME FOR BOLDNESS&#39;
Biden signed a total of 17 
executive orders
 within minutes of entering the Oval Office for the first time on Wednesday. The orders reversed a number of 
Trump administration
 policies and covered areas Biden identified as his priorities on the campaign trail, including the coronavirus pandemic and 
climate change
.
In addition to halting the Keystone XL oil pipeline project, Biden renewed the U.S. commitment to the Paris climate agreement, just three years after President Trump withdrew support.
&#34;This is a major infrastructure project that President Biden killed six hours into his presidency,&#34; Daines said. &#34;It&#39;s outrageous and it&#39;s going to get worse.&#34;
Daines is also worried about the Biden administration’s plans to put a pause on any new oil and gas leases on federal lands. He said the administration is yielding to &#34;the far-left radical extremists&#34; who are pushing the Green New Deal.
BIDEN TO SIGN 17 EXECUTIVE ACTIONS, ORDERS TO REVERSE TRUMP POLICIES, RESTORE OBAMA-ERA PROGRAMS ON FIRST DAY
&#34;It&#39;s already beginning to be implemented,&#34; he said. &#34;We&#39;re seeing it before our very eyes -- it&#39;s going to kill jobs. It&#39;s going to raise energy prices.&#34;
Daines added this action brings up national security issues as well.
&#34;Thank God that we&#39;ve had this revolution in 
energy
 in America to reduce our dependency on the Middle East,&#34; he said. &#34;[Biden’s action] reverses that course and places the dependence back on the 
Middle East
. That is terrible policy for our country.&#34;
Daines said he believes these policies show Democrats are &#34;no longer a friend&#34; to the American worker.

&#34;They are friends with the radical left, Green New Deal side of the party. This is a huge mistake,&#34; he said.

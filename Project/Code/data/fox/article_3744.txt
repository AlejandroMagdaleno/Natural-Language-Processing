First lady 
Jill Biden
 underwent a &#34;successful&#34; medical procedure Thursday at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to remove an object logged in her foot, her office announced.

 last weekend while walking on a beach when an indeterminate &#34;object&#34; lodged itself in her foot, according to the 
White House

The first lady &#34;underwent a successful procedure on her left foot to flush out debris from a puncture wound. After inspection of the wound by medical staff, it is unclear what object caused the puncture,&#34; press secretary for the first lady, Michael LaRosa, said in a statement.
The wound is &#34;clean, free of infection&#34; and anticipated to &#34;heal nicely.&#34;
The president is expected to depart with the first lady for the White House late Thursday night.

&#34;I’m here to ask everyone listening right now, to choose to get vaccinated,&#34; the first lady said.

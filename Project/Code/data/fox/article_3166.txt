Democratic 
Illinois
 Gov. JB Pritzker and 
Chicago
 Mayor Lori Lightfoot got a nasty reception from fans Thursday when they appeared for the Chicago White Sox’s home opener at Guaranteed Rate Field.
Pritzker and Lightfoot were greeted by a chorus of boos as they walked onto the field ahead of the first pitch. A reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times noted that the Democratic politicians drew more boos while walking onto the field than the White Sox opponent, the Kansas City Royals.
About 9,000 fans were slated to attend the team’s first home game of the 2021 season. Attendance at White Sox home games is currently limited to 22% capacity in order to comply with coronavirus-related restrictions.
Lightfoot, who has served as Chicago’s mayor since 2019, is a White Sox season ticket holder. She was also booed while attending the crosstown Chicago Cubs’ home opener at Wrigley Field last week.
Lightfoot has faced criticism from both sides of the aisle during her tenure. In a recent column, the 
Chicago Tribune
 noted the mayor &#34;hasn’t yet fulfilled key campaign promises,&#34; such as a pledge to implement an elected school board.

Chicago Tribune

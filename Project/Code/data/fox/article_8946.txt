Maybe they’ll start calling him &#34;Flyin’ Ted.&#34;
Texas
 Sen. 
Ted Cruz
 retweeted a news story from Houston’s 
ABC affiliate
 about cheap flights to &#34;sunny Cancun or even Las Vegas.&#34;
&#34;Awesome!&#34; he wrote, a wink at a scandal over the winter involving a poorly timed family vacation to Cancun.
Cruz had flown with his kids to the resort town in February as severe winter weather battered his home state, leaving hundreds of thousands without power as temperatures plummeted to record lows. And almost 200 people died, according to the 
Houston Chronicle

CRUZ ADMITS CANCUN TRIP ‘OBVIOUSLY A MISTAKE’ AS HE RETURNS TO FIND PROTESTERS OUTSIDE HIS TEXAS HOME
Critics blasted the move, and Cruz returned to Texas within 24 hours.

It’s not the first time the Texas senator has taken his sense of humor to Twitter.
Last week, when &#34;Tiger King&#34; star Carole Baskin alleged that he had some responsibility for Houston’s missing tiger case, he posted a gif of Joe Exotic doing a double-take.
And when Britain’s Prince Harry said during a podcast that America’s First Amendment is &#34;bonkers,&#34; Cruz reacted with another tweet: &#34;Wait till he finds out what’s in the Second Amendment...&#34;
And when video appeared to show him falling asleep during President Biden’s address before a joint session of Congress last month, Cruz retweeted it with the caption, &#34;#BoringButRadical.&#34;

President Biden addresses the press after a one-on-one with Vladimir Putin.
President Biden
 raised eyebrows with an odd gaffe during his press conference following a summit with Russian President 
Vladimir Putin
, in which he appeared to mistakenly use the name of his own predecessor when discussing the Russian leader.
Biden spoke after Putin gave a separate press conference, and was reflecting on what he said about the Arctic.
BIDEN, AT G-7, SAYS US, RUSSIA CAN WORK TOGETHER TO HELP PEOPLE OF ‘LIBYA’ – MEANT TO SAY ‘SYRIA,’ AIDES SAY
&#34;I caught part of President, uh, Tru-- uh, Putin&#39;s press conference, and he talked about the need for us to have some kind of modus operandi where the Arctic was in fact a free zone,&#34; Biden said.
House Republicans were quick to point out the error.
Twitter users quickly took notice, with more than 2,900 likes and 1,100 retweets. A 
tweet
 observing the mix-up posted by CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins drew more than 17,000 likes and 1,400 retweets.
TRUMP RAILS AGAINST BIDEN&#39;S ‘GOOD DAY FOR RUSSIA’ SUMMIT WITH PUTIN, HIGHLIGHTS HUNTER&#39;S ALLEGED TIES
This was not the president&#39;s first goof of the week. At the G-7 summit Sunday, Biden mixed up 
Libya and Syria
 – not once, but three times – while discussing humanitarian aid to countries torn apart by civil war. 
He first discussed possibly working with Russia in providing &#34;vital assistance&#34; to &#34;Libya&#34; – a &#34;population that’s in real trouble.&#34; Then he said Russia had bitten off more than it can chew with its intervention in &#34;Syria&#34; but then added &#34;Libya&#34; to the mix.

&#34;As long as they’re there without the ability to bring about some order in the region, you can’t do that very well without providing for the basic economic needs of people,&#34; Biden said soon after. &#34;So, I’m hopeful that we can find an accommodation where we can save the lives of people in, for example, in Libya.&#34; 
Biden&#39;s aides later brushed off the apparent gaffe, saying he had meant to say Syria when saying Libya.

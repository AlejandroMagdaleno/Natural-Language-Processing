President Biden&#39;s
 nominee for director of the 
Bureau
 of Land Management. Tracy Stone-Manning, is under fire from 
Republicans
 for receiving an allegedly unethical loan while working as a congressional staffer.
&#34;The Senator has concerns with something raised by another senator at the hearing on an ethics issue about Ms. Stone-Manning receiving a heavily discounted personal loan while serving as a congressional staffer,&#34; a spokesperson for Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., told Fox News. &#34;He believes before we can move forward with consideration of Ms. Stone-Manning’s nomination, we need clarity on terms and circumstances.&#34;
Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., pressed Stone-Manning on a personal loan of between $50,000 and $100,00 that she took out during her time as the state director for Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., during a Tuesday hearing.
Marshall said that her loan&#39;s interest rate was significantly below the market rate and asked Stone-Manning if she believed it may have posed an ethical problem. Stone-Manning replied that she values ethics and defended the loan as help from a friend when her family was struggling in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

&#34;According to your disclosure it looks like you received that [loan] at an interest rate of 6% but the going rate for a consumer loan was 11%,&#34; Marshall said in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. &#34;Do you feel like that&#39;s some type of conflict of interest?&#34;
&#34;Ethics are deeply important to me,&#34; Stone-Manning said. &#34;Like many families in 2008, we got smacked by the recession and a friend loaned us some money to make sure that we could get through it. And we came to terms and we honored the loan.&#34;

The individual who gave the loan to Stone-Manning is Stuart Goldberg, a 
Montana developer
. Marshall&#39;s concerns about the loan were not eased by Stone-Manning&#39;s answers, Fox News is told, and he plans to submit further questions for the record to Stone-Manning about her history with Goldberg. 
Those questions will press Stone-Manning on whether she was aware the interest rate on the loan was below the market rate; whether she interacted with Goldberg in an official capacity when she worked for Tester; whether Goldberg sought assistance from Tester&#39;s office &#34;around the time&#34; of the loan; whether Stone-Manning ceased her official interactions with Goldberg after she got the loan; and whether Goldberg and Stone-Manning previously exchanged gifts. 
Under Senate ethics rules, loans are considered a form of gift. Gifts from friends are expressly allowed under Senate ethics rules. But there are factors that are considered to confirm that such gifts are given due to a personal friendship and not a person&#39;s position in the Senate. 
According to the loan calculator from 
Bankrate
, a $50,000 loan at a 6% interest rate would cost just over $70,000 over the 12-year term of the loan while a $100,000 loan would cost $140,000. The same loans at an 11% interest rate would cost just over $90,000 and $180,000, respectively.

This means that Stone-Manning may have benefited between $20,000 and $40,000 from the loan arrangement with Goldberg.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story. 
Stone-Manning gave a brief answer to a follow-up question from Marshall at the Tuesday hearing, refusing to say whether she believed she &#34;gained something&#34; through the loan arrangement. 
&#34;Do you feel like that you gained something by that by not paying the standard interest rate?&#34; Marshall asked. &#34;That you were given an interest rate less than the average consumer interest rate was there?&#34;
&#34;I was grateful for the help from a friend,&#34; Stone-Manning said.

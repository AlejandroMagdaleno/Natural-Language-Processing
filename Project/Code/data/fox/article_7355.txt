Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, joins ‘America’s News HQ.’
White House
 Press Secretary Jen Psaki indicated on Tuesday that 
President Biden
 agreed with U.S. climate envoy John Kerry’s assessment that climate policies need to be a priority, but stopped short of saying whether he is on board with the idea that there are less than ten years left to thwart the worst consequences of a global climate crisis.
Psaki said during a press briefing that she did not have a new timeline to offer up from here, but acknowledged that Biden agreed with the former U.S. Secretary of State on the urgency of climate change.
&#34;The president agrees with former Secretary Kerry that it’s a crisis, that time is of the essence, we need to act quickly and that’s why climate is a key part of his agenda,&#34; Psaki said.
U.S. special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry noted during an interview with 
CBS
 last week that scientists said 3 years ago that there were 12 years remaining to avoid the worst of a global climate crisis.
&#34;We are now 3 years gone, so we have 9 years left,&#34; he said.
Those predictions are based on a report issued in 2018 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which does not suggest that anything bad will happen in 2030 – but rather that measurable effects on warming would occur between 2030 and 2050 unless mitigation efforts were undertaken to cut emissions.

Kerry said that more needs to be done – and even pledges agreed to in the Paris Climate Accord may not be enough.
&#34;Even if we did everything that we said we were going to do when we signed up in Paris we would see a rise in the Earth&#39;s temperature to somewhere around 3.7 degrees or more, which is catastrophic,&#34; Kerry told CBS.

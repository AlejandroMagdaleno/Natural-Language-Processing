The new Senate maverick bucks some of his Democratic colleagues on the filibuster
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., will co-sponsor the Senate version of House Democrats&#39; PRO Act, which would negate state right-to-work laws and force some workers to pay 
union
 dues in order to keep their jobs.
&#34;I look forward to working with my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to move this bill through a legislative process,&#34; Manchin said on Monday, Politico&#39;s Corbin Hiar 
reported
.
PRO ACT WOULD REQUIRE WORKERS TO JOIN UNIONS, FACES OPPOSITION FROM 14 STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL
Manchin was speaking at a National Press Club 
event
 with United Mine Workers of America head Cecil E. Roberts Jr.
West Virginia
 passed right-to-work legislation in 2016, according to the 
National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation
. Roughly 10% of West Virginia workers are union members, according to data from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics

The PRO Act (which stands for &#34;Protecting the Right to Organize&#34;) passed in the 
House of Representatives
 last year-- 
225-206
 -- but was never taken up by the then-Republican majority 
Senate
.
Manchin&#39;s support of the PRO Act was not guaranteed since he often breaks with his party. Still, the bill is not expected to be able to overcome a filibuster in the Senate.
The Coalition for a Democratic Workplace, which represents groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Restaurant Association, criticized Manchin.
&#34;It is very disappointing that Senator Manchin has chosen to side with union bosses over West Virginia’s workers and small businesses, especially during a time of economic turmoil,&#34; CDW Chair Kristen Swearingen said in a statement.
&#34;We hope Manchin will reconsider co-sponsoring this legislation as his legacy of bipartisanship will be irrevocably tainted if he supports anti-worker legislation that invades employees’ privacy and will kill West Virginia jobs, while taking the hard-earned income away from small businesses and employees to boost the coffers of organized labor.&#34;
Advocates of the measure say it would bolster collective bargaining rights. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told 
NPR
 last month the bill would be a &#34;game changer.&#34; 
&#34;If you really want to correct inequality in this country – wages and wealth inequality, opportunity and inequality of power – passing the PRO Act is absolutely essential to doing that,&#34; Trumka said.

Meanwhile, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson is 
leading a coalition
 of state attorneys general in opposition to the bill.
&#34;Our nation has always been one of opportunity that rewards individual choice, ingenuity, and initiative,&#34; Wilson said in a 
letter
. &#34;Our laws have long preserved the ability of employees to speak for themselves, to make informed decisions, and to work without being forced to pay fees to third parties.&#34;

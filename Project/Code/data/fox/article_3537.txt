An investigator general report found that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) &#34;improperly&#34; doled out and managed millions of dollars worth of taxpayer dollars in information technology contracts between 2017 and 2019.
The EPA&#39;s Office of Inspector General reported Wednesday that the agency had spent $52.5 million in taxpayer money on the deals, which the watchdog had investigated following a complaint about &#34;contract and bidding irregularities with three major information technology contracts.&#34;
The report said the EPA violated &#34;Federal Acquisition Regulation requirements and contract clauses&#34; when they &#34;purchased 23 pieces of hardware and software equipment&#34; through an &#34;expiring&#34; IT contract with Canadian IT company CGI Federal.
&#34;This purchase was outside the scope of the contract and was ultimately never used for that contract,&#34; wrote the IG’s office. &#34;The EPA then improperly solicited bids for one of two subsequent contracts and transferred the equipment to use on the new contract.&#34;

&#34;By approving the purchase, the EPA improperly spent $641,680 in federal funds,&#34; the report continued.
The report went on to reveal that the EPA &#34;issued task orders&#34; under the three contracts &#34;without approval&#34; from the agency’s CIO – which the watchdog says is &#34;required under the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA).&#34;
These tasks orders &#34;resulted in the EPA spending $52.5 million in taxpayer funds without proper approvals,&#34; the report read.
&#34;The agency also mismanaged these contracts with respect to monitoring property and licenses,&#34; the report continued. &#34;For example, the EPA underreported and incorrectly identified purchased equipment in the agency’s property reporting system and did not record $1.18 million in software licenses in the agency’s asset management system.&#34;

The IG said in the conclusion of the report that the EPA &#34;CIO was unaware of significant acquisitions made by the agency and was unable to appropriately review price competitions, cost reductions and duplicate equipment.&#34;
&#34;As a result, the EPA spent $52.5 million in taxpayer dollars without the CIO’s oversight,&#34; the IG concluded.
The watchdog recommended that the agency’s assistant administrator for mission support &#34;[r]eview all active contracts for acquisitions of information technology hardware, software and services in fiscal year 2016 and later&#34; to see if the &#34;required&#34; FITARA approvals had been &#34;obtained.&#34;
The IG also called on the assistant administrator to &#34;identify cost findings in the process from hardware and software purchases that were either duplicates or unnecessary&#34; and to &#34;[r]equire contracting officers to maintain records&#34; of CIO approvals, &#34;including those under&#34; FITARA.
When pressed for comment, a spokesperson for the EPA pointed Fox News to their response in the IG report, where the agency said it &#34;agreed&#34; with the IG’s recommendations in the report.

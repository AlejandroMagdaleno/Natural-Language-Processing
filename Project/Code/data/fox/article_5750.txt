Fight for Schools executive director Ian Prior blasts woke study, says they should offer scholarships instead of payments to students
ASHBURN, Va. – The 
Loudoun County
 
School Board
 elected on Tuesday a new member to replace the late Leslee King, who 
died at age 74
 in August.
The board selected 
Andrew Holyer
, who lost the 2019 school board election to King. 
Patti Hidalgo Menders, a Loudoun County mother and president of the Loudoun County Republican Women&#39;s Club, told Fox News that she was pleasantly surprised the board selected Holyer.
&#34;It&#39;s better than we thought they were going to pick, so it&#39;s half a celebration,&#34; she said.
Menders referred to Holyer as a &#34;moderate,&#34; suggesting that he would take seriously parents&#39; concerns about critical race theory, transgender activism and strict COVID-19 policies in schools.

Loudoun County has become ground zero in the ideological conflict over schools. In September, the county board of supervisors 
took up a proposal
 to study reparations to rectify historic racial segregation. Teacher 
Tanner Cross
 spoke publicly against a transgender policy and briefly got suspended by the school. He is fighting to keep his job in a months-long legal battle.
In a 
Facebook post
 at the time of King&#39;s passing, Holyer noted that &#34;while we were opponents on paper, Leslee and I were never opponents in life. Hearing of her passing today is shocking, saddening, and the worst news I have heard in a very long time.&#34;
Holyer noted that he was unopposed in his campaign for nearly five months and was surprised to see King defeat him on Election Day. 
&#34;I was critical of Leslee at times, and openly disagreed with many votes and decisions. Despite this, she still showed a willingness to listen to me and return messages,&#34; he said. 
He ended the message by telling King, &#34;You will be missed.&#34;

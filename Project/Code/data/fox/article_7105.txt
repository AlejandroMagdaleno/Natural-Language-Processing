A 
Pennsylvania
 state lawmaker who made national headlines in 2019 for harassing pro-life demonstrators announced he is running for lieutenant governor on Monday.
&#34;I think every day about the values my Army officer parents instilled in me. To take responsibility, to show empathy, to have courage and to be authentic,&#34; Brian Sims said in his 
launch video
. &#34;I want to put those values to the direct service of the commonwealth.&#34;
PENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRAT JOHN FETTERMAN FILES PAPERWORK TO RUN FOR SEAT BEING VACATED BY TOOMEY
The Democrat 
faced backlash
 in 2019 for harassing an elderly woman and offering $100 to anyone who doxed teen girls praying outside a 
Philadelphia
 Planned Parenthood.
&#34;What we&#39;ve got here is a bunch of protesters, a bunch of pseudo-Christian protesters, who&#39;ve been out here shaming young girls for being here,&#34; Sims said in a 2019 video he recorded of himself. &#34;So here&#39;s the deal, I&#39;ve got $100 for anyone who will identify any of these three I&#39;m going to donate to Planned Parenthood. A bunch of White people ... shaming people.&#34;
Sims apologized -- but not to the teen girls or the elderly woman -- in a Planned Parenthood fundraising email 
posted
 by New York Post columnist Salena Zito on Twitter.
&#34;I wanted to send an apology,&#34; Sims wrote. &#34;I recognize my behavior was aggressive and that I acted in an inappropriate way. For that, I am truly sorry.&#34;
The state representative then went after pro-life supporters.
&#34;I&#39;m angry that pro-life protesters use white privilege and racism to attack people of color in my district and across the nation,&#34; Sims said. &#34;I&#39;m angry that despite abortion being legal everywhere, anti-choice zealots are causing panic, anger, confusion, and rage for so many women.&#34;

Joe and Ashley Garecht, the parents of two of the teen girls — ages 13 and 15 — targeted by Sims ended up 
raising over $125,000
 for the Pro-Life Union of Greater Philadelphia as a response to the cash offer to find the names of the teen girls peacefully praying during Holy Week.
Garecht weighed in on Sims&#39; candidacy on Monday.
&#34;Brian Sims is a disgrace, and our commonwealth deserves better,&#34; he wrote on 
Twitter
. &#34;Any governor candidate who allies with him should be prepared. We held a rally with 2000 people in Philly when Sims did this. We will be just as vocal against your candidacy if you team up with Sims.&#34;
Pennsylvania&#39;s current lieutenant governor, Democrat John Fetterman, announced earlier in February that he is 
running
 for the state&#39;s open Senate seat. 
Sims has represented his Philadelphia district in the state legislature since 2013. He ran for Congress in Pennsylvania&#39;s 2nd Congressional District in 2016 but dropped out, according to 
Ballotpedia

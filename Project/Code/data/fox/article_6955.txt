Former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman calls the Kabul airport a &#39;kill zone&#39; as Americans are told to avoid it
A new national poll indicates that most Americans want U.S. troops to remain at the airport in

&#39;s capital city of Kabul until all Americans, as well as Afghans who aided the U.S. during the 20-year conflict in the war-torn central Asian country, are evacuated.
More than 8 in 10 (84%) Americans say that  U.S. troops should remain in the country until all Americans are evacuated, according to a

released on Sunday. And 71% of those questioned said the troops should stay until all Afghans who helped the U.S. are evacuated as well.

U.S. CARRIED OUT DEADLY AIRSTRIKE AGAINST ISIS-K TERRORISTS IN KABUL
President Biden 
has remained firm that all U.S. forces should be out of Afghanistan by a Tuesday deadline.
The poll was conducted Friday and Saturday, after Thursday’s terrorist attack on the international airport in Kabul, which left 13 U.S. troops and scores of Afghan civilians dead, with hundreds more wounded. ISIS-K, an affiliate of the Islamic State terrorist group, claimed responsibility for the horrific attack.

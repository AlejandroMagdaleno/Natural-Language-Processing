The Democratic opponent who lost to Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., in the 
general election
 appeared on Monday to compare Cawthorn to a Guantanamo Bay detainee. 
Retired U.S. Air Force Col. Moe Davis, who served as the Chief Prosecutor of the Guantanamo military commissions between 2005 and 2007, tweeted that there is &#34;far more evidence of Congressman Madison Cawthorn’s guilt than there was of guilt for 95+ percent of the detainees.&#34; 
&#34;It’s time we start a domestic war on sedition by American 
terrorists
,&#34; Davis said. 
Davis appeared to be referring to the fact that Cawthorn spoke at a Trump rally moments before a mob 
attacked the Capitol
 on Jan. 6, and refused to accept Joe Biden’s presidential victory. 
Cawthorn told the crowd that &#34;Democrats, with all the fraud they have done in this election, the Republicans, hiding and not fighting, they are trying to silence your voice.&#34; 
CAPITOL POLICE’S PREPARATION FOR DEADLY RIOT REMAINS SHROUDED IN SECRECY, THANKS TO FOIA EXEMPTION
Cawthorn’s involvement in the rally prompted state Democrats from Cawthorn’s 11th Congressional District to write a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., asking for an investigation into the Republican congressman. They claim there was an ethics violation for &#34;violent language&#34; he used leading up to the Capitol riots.

Cawthorn said he had a constitutional duty to vote against Biden. He condemned the violence in Wednesday&#39;s attack, but compared it to last summer&#39;s protests over police brutality.

FIRST ON FOX:
 Gov. Gavin Newsom removed his children from a summer camp after photos surfaced of his son attending the camp indoors maskless. 
&#34;​​The Newsoms were concerned to see unvaccinated children unmasked indoors at a camp their children began attending yesterday. Their kids will no longer be attending the camp,&#34; the governor’s communications director, Erin Mellon, told Fox News in a statement Tuesday when asked about the photos. 
CDC SAYS SCHOOLS SHOULD OPEN IN FALL, RECOMMENDS MASKS FOR UNVACCINATED
California
’s current guidance for children aged 2-11 states they must wear masks during &#34;
camps for youth, youth sports and other youth activities
, including theater and music performances and band. Updated CDC guidance is forthcoming for youth settings.&#34;
California officials announced July 9
 that students and teachers returning to the classroom this year will also be required to wear masks, regardless of vaccination status. 
&#34;We’re going to start with a requirement K through 12 that the year begins with masks,&#34; California Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly said at the time. &#34;At the outset of the new year, students should be able to walk into school without worrying about whether they will feel different or singled out for being vaccinated or unvaccinated — treating all kids the same will support a calm and supportive school environment.&#34;
The photos of Newsom’s son sparked the ire of some social media users, including the Twitter account Reopen California Schools, 
a group that recently filed a lawsuit against the governor over the update
 requiring students wear face masks in the classroom. 
&#34;This is in clear violation of his own mask mandates. Why can his kid be maskless, but not ours?&#34; Reopen California Schools posted on Twitter, noting it would not publish photos of Newsom’s son.

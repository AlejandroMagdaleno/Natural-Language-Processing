Senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports on US soldiers being pulled out of Afghanistan on &#39;America Reports.&#39;
President Biden
 won&#39;t be taking any victory lap on the withdrawal of troops from 
Afghanistan
, and instead the 
White House
 offered a sober reality that America&#39;s longest war just can&#39;t be won militarily. 
&#34;We&#39;re not going to have a mission accomplished moment in this regard,&#34; White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday referring to the premature &#34;Mission Accomplished&#34; banner that served as the backdrop of former President George W. Bush&#39;s 2003 speech on an aircraft carrier. &#34;It&#39;s a 20-year war that has not been won militarily.&#34;
Biden addressed the nation Thursday about his decision to remove U.S. troops from Afghanistan despite the growing threat from the Taliban. During a White House news briefing prior to his remarks, Psaki said while there may be drawbacks to the decision, Biden didn&#39;t want to sacrifice more lives and treasure on a war that has gone on for too long.

&#34;He is not going to ask another generation of kids to go and serve in Afghanistan in a war that he does not feel can be won militarily,&#34; Psaki said. &#34;That is the core driver of his decision here.&#34;
With the 
Taliban surge
 occurring in Afghanistan as the U.S. troops are already 90% gone, the White House sought to focus on some of the positives of the last 20 years – such as finding and killing Usama bin Laden and ensuring Afghanistan can&#39;t be used as a home base for terrorist attacks on the United States and its allies.

&#34;We did exactly what we intended to do … however, there is not a benefit, in our view, in continuing to fight this war militarily,&#34; Psaki said.

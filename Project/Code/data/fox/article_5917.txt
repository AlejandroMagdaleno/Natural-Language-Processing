New York City
 mayoral candidate Fernando Mateo said he believes Republicans have &#34;not a fighting chance, a winning chance&#34; in the mayor’s race this year given what he sees as ineptitudes from Mayor 
Bill de Blasio
 and Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo.
 
Mateo, a native of the Dominican Republic, has long served as head of the state Federation of Taxi Drivers, and more recently took a leadership role with the Bodegas Association of America 
&#34;There’s a turning point going on right now, but we need to have the right Republican running for office,&#34; the taxi and bodega advocate told Fox News in an interview Saturday.
In the 2017 race for mayor, de Blasio won a second term with 66.17 percent of the vote. Republican Malliotakis, now serving in the House, earned only 27.59 percent.

&#34;The guy has been clueless since he took office,&#34; Mateo said of the city’s Democrat mayor. &#34;He has had no leadership, he has been bullied and pummeled by Cuomo. Cuomo has been the governor and he’s also been the mayor.&#34; The two New York Democrats have a long-running feud that boiled over during the coronavirus pandemic.  
Meanwhile, Mateo said that Cuomo’s career in politics is &#34;done&#34; after the revelations of his mishandling of nursing homes. 
He said he jumped into the race because the Democratic candidates are &#34;basically a continuation of de Blasio.&#34; 
&#34;We don’t need that, our city is in shambles-- crime is through the roof, our economy is underground right now, we need to get small businesses back,&#34; he said, noting that 80,000 had closed as a result of the pandemic. 
&#34;First thing we need to do is get public safety back. No one wants to be in a city that isn’t safe,&#34; he continued. 
Mateo said he would add &#34;thousands&#34; of NYPD officers to the streets and work to restructure the city’s bail reform law. 
Under New York City’s bail laws enacted last year, a slew of ‘non-violent’ offenses are not bail-eligible, allowing those who allegedly commit crimes such as burglaries, domestic abuse cases and even second-degree manslaughter, to walk free until their trial dates.

&#34;It&#39;s not helping those who commit minor crime and deserve bail reform. This was not put together the right way, we opened up the jails and let every gun-toting criminal out on the street,&#34; said Mateo. 
Mateo said he believes Cuomo’s career in politics is &#34;over.&#34; He said that Cuomo has been &#34;out of touch,&#34; throughout the pandemic, recalling when the governor implored rich New Yorkers to return to the city. &#34;I’ll buy you a drink!&#34; he told them in August. &#34;First of all there’s nowhere to buy them a drink because he shut everything down so that’s very hypocritical of him,&#34; Mateo said.  
Mateo said that Cuomo &#34;deserves everything that’s happening to him,&#34; with the firestorm he’s facing for the nursing home scandal after shutting down businesses that had broken his stringent protocol for restaurants. &#34;‘Why would you do that? People are struggling, don’t kick them while they’re down.&#34;
&#34;I believe his career in politics is done, it is over. When you can’t admit that you made a mistake that cost thousands of people their lives, this will follow him and haunt him for the rest of his career, the rest of his life.&#34;

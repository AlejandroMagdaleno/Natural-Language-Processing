California gubernatorial candidate joins &#39;Hannity&#39; to discuss immigration stance
Caitlyn Jenner, who wants to be 
California’s
 next governor, said undocumented 
immigrants
 should have a chance to become citizens – but &#34;the bad ones&#34; have to leave.
&#34;What’s been happening on the border was honestly one of the reasons I decided to run for governor,&#34; the Republican reality star said in a CNN clip released Sunday.

&#34;I was watching people dying come across the river, kids in cages – whatever you want to call them,&#34; she told Dana Bash in the interview that’s scheduled to air in its entirety on &#34;Anderson Cooper 360&#34; Monday night.
The Olympic medalist had recently said she was in favor of a wall along the Mexican border, but in the clip she tells Bash there should &#34;absolutely&#34; be a path to citizenship after the broadcaster says there are 1.75 million undocumented workers in the Golden State.

&#34;There’s a lot of people, but personally I have met some of the most wonderful people who are immigrants, who have come to this country – and they are just model citizens, they are just great people – and I would fight for them to be U.S. citizens and I think it would be the greatest day of their life,&#34; Jenner said.
But &#34;the bad ones have to leave,&#34; Jenner said when asked about deportation. Bash pressed Jenner on what she meant by bad ones.
&#34;Criminal records, MS-13, the list goes on,&#34; Jenner said. &#34;There’s a lot of bad people that are trying to cross our border illegally. I don’t want those people in our country.&#34;

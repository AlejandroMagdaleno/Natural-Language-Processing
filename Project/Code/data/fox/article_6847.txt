The cost of former 
President Obama
&#39;s library in 
Chicago
 will be a bit heftier than initially anticipated. 
Valerie Jarrett, president of The Obama Foundation, said during an

 with The Economic Club of Chicago last week that the informal presidential library will cost slightly &#34;less than&#34; $700 million – $200 million more than an initial estimate of 
$500 million

told
 the Economic Club in an April 4 interview that he envisions the library as both a cultural and teaching institution, as well as a museum, in the city &#34;at a time when Chicago, like much of the country, sometimes feels divided,&#34; he said.
The foundation is planning a groundbreaking by this fall.

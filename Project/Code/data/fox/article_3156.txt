Former Trump advisory board member Jason Meister and Manhattan Institute adjunct fellow Judy Miller debate Rep. Ilhan Omar&#39;s comments comparing the U.S. and Israel to Hamas and the Taliban.
Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., tore into Rep. 
Ilhan Omar
, D-Minn., on Wednesday for making &#34;outrageous and clearly false statements&#34; about the 
United 
States
 
and 
Israel
.
Sherman blasted his colleague for a recent tweet in which the congresswoman claimed that America and Israel had committed &#34;unthinkable atrocities&#34; akin to the Taliban and Hamas.
ILHAN OMAR SAYS AMERICA, LIKE HAMAS AND THE TALIBAN, HAS COMMITTED ‘UNTHINKABLE ATROCITIES’
Sherman — a senior Democrat who has served since 1997 — torched Omar in a press release retorting the second-term representative&#39;s tweet, saying what is &#34;newsworthy&#34; is Omar admitting Hamas &#34;is guilty of ‘unthinkable atrocities.’&#34;
&#34;It&#39;s not news that Ilhan Omar would make outrageous and clearly false statements about America and Israel,&#34; Sherman wrote. &#34;What&#39;s newsworthy is that she admits Hamas is guilty of ‘unthinkable atrocities.’&#34;
&#34;It&#39;s time for all of Israel&#39;s detractors to condemn Hamas,&#34; Sherman continued. &#34;And it’s time for all those of good will to reject any moral equivalency between the U.S. and Israel on one hand, and Hamas and the Taliban on the other.&#34;
Omar’s office did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.
Known for being part of so-called 
&#34;Squad&#34; 
of new and progressive House members, Omar posted her controversial tweet on Monday that directly grouped the U.S. and Israel with the terror organizations, sparking the backlash from Sherman.
&#34;We have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban,&#34; the congresswoman wrote. &#34;I asked [Secretary of State Antony Blinken] where people are supposed to go for justice.&#34;
The former member of the Minnesota House of Representatives is no stranger to controversy. 
She recently accused Israel of committing &#34;war crimes&#34; following days of conflict between Israel and Hamas that saw thousands of missiles fired indiscriminately at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.

&#34;We should all be grateful that a ceasefire will prevent more civilians and children from being killed,&#34; Omar tweeted in May. &#34;But now what? We need accountability for every war crime committed.&#34;
&#34;And we need to stop underwriting crimes against humanity while doing nothing to end the occupation,&#34; she continued.

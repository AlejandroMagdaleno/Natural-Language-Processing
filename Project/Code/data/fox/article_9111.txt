FOX News contributor Judith Miller and former Deputy Independent Counsel Sol Wisenberg weigh in on &#39;America&#39;s News HQ&#39;
They didn’t just win the Super Bowl but 
Donald Trump
’s impeachment defense team appear to be feeling that way after getting the former president a second 
impeachment
 acquittal.
&#34;We’re going to Disney World,&#34; Trump lawyer Michael van der Veen joked to reporters, repeating a line uttered by a litany of Super Bowl MVPs since Giants quarterback Phil Simms first said it following Big Blue’s win in 1987.
TRUMP CELEBRATES ACQUITTAL IN SENATE TRIAL, FORESHADOWS POLITICAL FUTURE: &#39;MUCH TO SHARE&#39;
Van der Veen uttered the phrase as he departed the Capitol after the Senate voted 57-43 against convicting the former commander-in-chief Saturday.
Van der Veen then fist-bumped a colleague as they kept walking.
Prior to departing, the group of lawyers were seen looking jovial as they celebrated their win. All were seen posing for pictures and joking around with one another.
Earlier in the day, Van der Veen maintained in his closing arguments that impeaching Trump over a heated pre-riot speech would violate his First Amendment rights and called the proceeding unconstitutional.
Two thirds of the Senate, or 67 votes, was needed for conviction. Only seven Republicans joined Democrats in voting to convict, leaving them 10 short.

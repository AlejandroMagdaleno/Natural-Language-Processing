Sen. Tom Cotton R-Ark. says Colin Kahl’s past tweets and attacks on his critics make him unfit for the position. 
Sen. 
Tom Cotton
 R-Ark. said Friday that President 
Joe Biden’s
 nominee for the No. 3 civilian position at the 
Pentagon
 doesn’t have the &#34;temperament&#34; for the job, citing &#34;vicious&#34; verbal attacks against people criticizing his position on the Iran nuclear deal and past tweets about 
Republicans
.
Cotton, during an appearance on 
&#34;America’s Newsroom,&#34;
 explained 
Colin Kahl’s
 support for the Iran nuclear deal, &#34;weak&#34; position on 
Israel
 and long record of &#34;volatile outbursts&#34; against people that disagree with him shows that the former Pentagon official isn’t fit for the &#34;critical&#34; role of Undersecretary of Defense for Policy.
&#34;Most of [Kahl’s] social media posts were happening in the middle of the night when he was presumably sitting at home reading the news,&#34; Cotton said.
&#34;If that’s his reaction under such conditions what is he going to be like in the Pentagon when Iran hijacks another American boat or China shoots down an American aircraft?&#34;

During his Senate confirmation hearing Thursday, Kahl apologized for some of his past statements, calling his own language &#34;disrespectful.&#34;
&#34;There were a number of positions that President Trump took that I strongly oppose – I think the language that I used in opposing those was sometimes disrespectful and for that, I apologize,&#34; Kahl said.
&#34;I understand that the position of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, while it’s a political appointment it is not a political job- it’s a policy job.&#34;
Kahl is also facing concern from Republicans about his views on Iran and his ties to a progressive group called the Ploughshares Fund that played a key role in creating an &#34;echo chamber&#34; to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the American public.
The Ploughshares Fund gave the center at least $165,000 in grants for Iran-related research while Kahl was a fellow there between 2012 and 2014, according to Ploughshares&#39; annual tax filings from that time.

Ploughshares is also a longtime supporter of the 
National Iranian American Council
 (NIAC), which critics claim lobbies in Washington, D.C., 
on behalf of the Iranian government

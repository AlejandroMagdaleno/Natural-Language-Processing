FOX News senior meteorologist Janice Dean joins &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39; with her reaction
A 2015 tweet from House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
, D-Calif., is coming back to haunt her as Democratic New York Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 is facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment. 
The New York Times reported on Monday of a third accuser who alleged that Cuomo touched her bare lower back and asked if he could kiss her at a 2019 wedding the two of them attended. This comes after two former aides came forward with other misconduct allegations. 
However, an old tweet from the speaker showed her participating in a panel discussion with the now-embattled governor addressing sexual assault on college campuses. 
NANCY PELOSI CALLS CUOMO SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS &#39;CREDIBLE&#39;
&#34;Too many women are sexually assaulted while in college. Joined @NYGuvCuomo to discuss why #EnoughIsEnough!&#34; Pelosi exclaimed. 
Critics mocked the poorly-aged tweet on social media. 
&#34;This aged like milk,&#34; Beck &amp; Stone brand strategist Nick Lindquist reacted. 
NEW YORK GOV. ANDREW CUOMO ACCUSED BY THIRD WOMAN OF UNWANTED SEXUAL ADVANCES
&#34;Correct. So when are you calling for his resignation, Madam Speaker?&#34; Reagan Batallion asked.
Before Cuomo&#39;s third accuser came forward, Pelosi called the allegations made by the governor&#39;s former aides &#34;credible.&#34;
&#34;The women who have come forward with serious and credible charges against Governor Cuomo deserve to be heard and to be treated with dignity,&#34; Pelosi said in a statement provided exclusively to Fox News. &#34;The independent investigation must have due process and respect for everyone involved.&#34;
Last Wednesday, Lindsey Boylan, the former deputy secretary for economic development and a special adviser to Cuomo, accused the governor in a damning essay published on Wednesday of going &#34;out of his way to touch me on my lower back, arms and legs,&#34; forcibly kissing her on the lips during a one-on-one briefing, and suggesting that they &#34;play strip poker&#34; during a plane ride.

Charlotte Bennett, who is described in a bombshell report from The New York Times on Saturday as &#34;an executive assistant and health policy adviser in the Cuomo administration until she left in November,&#34; alleged that Cuomo &#34;asked her questions about her sex life, whether she was monogamous in her relationships and if she had ever had sex with older men.&#34;
The third woman, Anna Ruch, told the Times that Cuomo touched her bare lower back and asked if he could kiss her during a wedding reception.

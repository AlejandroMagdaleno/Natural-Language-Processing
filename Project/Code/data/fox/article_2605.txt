Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on Secretary Antony Blinken testifying on Afghanistan withdrawal.
FIRST ON FOX: 
Republican Sen. 
Tom 
Cotton
 
of 
Arkansas
 
is dropping a new bill taking aim at public school policies that &#34;subvert parental authority&#34; when it comes to students’ gender identities and gender changes. 
Cotton is introducing the Empower Parents to Protect Their Kids Act on Thursday to address numerous U.S. 
public school
 &#34;policies to allow students of any age to change their name, pronouns, gender identity and even sex-based accommodations (e.g. locker rooms) without parental notice or consent,&#34; according to a bill summary exclusively obtained by Fox News.
&#34;Schools should work with parents to support kids,&#34; Cotton told Fox News in a Thursday email. &#34;But when it comes to ‘gender transition,’ many educators believe they know better and have undermined or even outright lied to parents about their own children’s welfare.&#34;
TOM COTTON: BIDEN ADMIN TRYING TO HIDE THE CONSEQUENCES OF DISASTROUS OPEN BORDER POLICIES
&#34;That’s wrong – my bill will help moms and dads fight back against schools that try to take away parents’ responsibility for their children,&#34; the senator continued.
The summary points to 
New Jersey
 state policy stating a &#34;school district shall accept a student’s asserted gender identity&#34; without requiring &#34;parental consent&#34; as well as the Madison, Wisconsin, school district’s policy that disallows school staff sharing &#34;any information that may reveal a student’s gender identity to others, including parents or guardians.&#34;
&#34;These policies subvert parental authority and subject children to an experimental psychological intervention that has a high likelihood of changing their life path,&#34; the summary reads. &#34;Schools should never be allowed to infringe upon the sacred bonds of family life and confuse children.&#34;
Legislatively, Cotton’s bill would stop federal funds from going to public schools if they do not follow three &#34;requirements regarding minor students&#34;: obtaining &#34;parental consent before facilitating a student’s gender transition in any way,&#34; not withholding &#34;information from parents or coerce students to withhold information from their parents about their purported gender identity,&#34; and not pressuring &#34;parents or students to proceed with any specific treatment for gender dysphoria.&#34;

In addition to barring taxpayer dollars from going to public schools that do not comply with the requirements, the bill would establish a &#34;private right of action to empower parents to enforce these policies in court, with attorney’s fees granted to the prevailing plaintiff.&#34;
The new legislation would also require schools to give parents a copy of their policies to parents as well as publish said policies on school websites, and report their compliance to the secretary of education.

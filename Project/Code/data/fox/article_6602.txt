Radio host targeted in California recall
A 
California
 professor campaigning for 
Gov. Gavin Newsom
 reportedly called Republican gubernatorial candidate Larry Elder &#34;a Black face on White supremacy&#34; during an event with the governor Monday.
Newsom appeared at a get out the vote event with Black elected leaders in Crenshaw ahead of the Sept. 14 recall 
election
, in which Californians will decide whether to recall the governor or keep him in office. Voters who choose &#34;yes&#34; to recall will also be able to pick one of 46 candidates to replace the governor.
LARRY ELDER COULD MAKE HISTORY AS CALIFORNIA&#39;S FIRST BLACK GOVERNOR
Elder, a conservative radio host, is the clear front-runner among the candidates and could make history as 
California’s
 first Black governor. But according to LAist reporter Kyle Stokes, speakers at Monday’s rally tried to paint him as a racist.
Without mentioning Elder by name, state Sen. Sydney Kamlager said there&#39;s a recall challenger who &#34;thinks he might have an edge because of his color. But racism … comes in all shapes and sizes, and we’re not stupid,&#34; Stokes 
reported
.
Melina Abdullah, a professor at California State University, Los Angeles, followed up by saying, &#34;She didn’t say his name, but I will: Larry Elder is a Black face on White supremacy,&#34; Stokes reported.
The event was hosted by African American Voter Registration and Education Project (AAVREP) with U.S. Rep. Karen Bass
&#34;I really want to express to all of you that I have your back,&#34; Newsom 
told supporters
. &#34;This is an attack on our values, the things we hold dear as a state.&#34;
&#34;Just consider the prospect if we don&#39;t vote ‘no’ on this election,&#34; he said, painting a dire picture for California policies on climate change, labor, and social justice if Elder is elected.
Elder has repeatedly faced racism claims by the left because of his political views. 
A recent column by The Los Angeles Times
 called him &#34;the Black face of White supremacy.&#34;
&#34;I anticipated that would happen. This is why a lot of people don’t go into politics because of the politics of personal destruction,&#34; Elder 
told Fox News
 late last month.

&#34;This is not the first time the L.A. Times has attacked me, there is another writer who all but called me a Black David Duke,&#34; he added. &#34;They are scared to death.&#34;
Elder has also 
forcefully denied a recent claim
 from his former fiancée that he brandished a gun during an argument the two had in 2015. Republican candidates Kevin Faulconer and Caitlyn Jenner called on him to drop out of the race over the allegations.

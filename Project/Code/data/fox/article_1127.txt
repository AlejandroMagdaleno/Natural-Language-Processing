President Biden
 on Monday had his first known sit-down visit to a DC restaurant since becoming president — joined by Vice President 
Kamala

In honor of Jill Biden, the restaurant this year had lobster risotto, her favorite dish, as a menu special to celebrate her return to DC.

Biden received an enthusiastic welcome. He arrived after visiting military graves and warning in a speech that democracy is &#34;in peril&#34; within the US.
The overwhelmingly Democratic DC handed Biden a more than 92 percent victory over Trump in November and spectators cheered as Biden entered and as he exited about 70 minutes later.
Bettina Weiss, executive director of the group Elect Democratic Women, tweeted a video of Biden’s arrival. &#34;POTUS &amp; FLOTUS at Le Diplomate! Featuring my mother who is visiting from out of town. I couldn’t have planned this better,&#34;

A different Twitter user shared footage of Harris’ arrival with her husband, Doug Emhoff.
&#34;Thank you so much, you are amazing!&#34; a star-struck diner
 told Harris
.
&#34;We love you!&#34; someone else shouted toward Harris.

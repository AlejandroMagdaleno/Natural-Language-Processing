LOS ANGELES—Eric Garcetti, the Democrat mayor of Los Angeles, outlined the city’s budget that takes effect on July 1 and includes $24 million earmarked for a Guaranteed Basic Income pilot program that will provide 2,000 low-income families with $1,000 a month for the year.
Fox 11 
reported
 that Garcetti called the program the largest in the country and said the families will receive the funds, &#34;no questions asked.&#34;

The Los Angeles Times 
reported
 that the budget will be released on Tuesday. The paper said the Los Angeles City Council also plans to send more than $11 million in funds from the police department to new initiatives in poorer areas of the city. The paper pointed out that the budget needs to be approved by the City Council.

More than 160 federal and state lawmakers from both parties call for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo&#39;s resignation. Reaction from Assemblyman Angelo Santabarbara and New York State Senator Thomas O&#39;Mara.
New York
 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo
 was physically &#34;aroused&#34; when he allegedly 
hugged a press aide
 more than two decades ago, the woman said Monday.
Karen Hinton — who first went public against Cuomo on March 6 — detailed the alleged incident during an interview on WNYC radio.
&#34;He approached me, embraced too tightly, too long and was aroused,&#34; Hinton said. &#34;I felt extremely uncomfortable and actually shocked. Nothing had ever happened that way between the two of us.&#34;
Hinton — who’s married to lobbyist and former Cuomo administration official Howard Glaser — has said Cuomo twice hugged her inside a 
Los Angeles
 hotel room in December 2000.

At the time, Cuomo was 
then-President Bill Clinton’s housing secretary
 and Hinton was working as a consultant after having been employed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development from 1995 to 1999, she said Monday.
In the wake of Hinton’s initial accusation, Cuomo 
responded with a vehement denial
, insisting, &#34;What she said is not true.&#34;
Cuomo also pointed to the fact that she was formerly the press secretary for 
Mayor Bill de Blasio
, a political rival.
&#34;As everybody who has been involved on any level in New York politics knows, she has been a longtime political adversary of mine, highly critical for many, many years and has made many, many accusations,&#34; Cuomo said during a conference call with reporters on March 7.
Hinton then fired back with a statement saying, &#34;Truth is the ‘longtime adversary’ that Cuomo fears the most.&#34;

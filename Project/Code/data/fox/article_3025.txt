FOX News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the details on &#39;The Story&#39;
Members of the 
Washington D.C. City Council
 called Wednesday for the removal of three miles of security fencing placed around the U.S. 
Capitol
 as a defensive measure in the wake of the Jan. 6 riot.
In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the councilmembers said a &#34;hardened security perimeter,&#34; with fencing and razor wire, was the &#34;wrong solution.&#34; The security fencing has created logistical problems within the city, impacted local legislative operations and limited public access to the Capitol complex, they added.
&#34;We offer our full support and partnership to both investigate the deficiencies that led to the failures on January 6 and implement any changes in command or planning needed to ensure those events will never be repeated,&#34; the councilmembers said in the letter obtained by 
Fox 5 DC
. &#34;But permanent fencing, blocked streets, or diminished public access is not the way to secure the Capitol.&#34;
The city council expressed support for Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C, who introduced legislation earlier this month that would block Capitol authorities from installing a permanent fence around the area. Norton likened the concept to &#34;security theater based on 19th-century ideas&#34; and, like the local lawmakers, argued it would limit public access.

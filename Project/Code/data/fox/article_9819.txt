FOX News White House correspondent Peter Doocy joins &#39;Special Report&#39; with more from Washington
The process by which the White House addresses potential conflicts of interest like Vice President Kamala Harris’ niece using her aunt’s name to boost her brand has not been made public, but it possibly could be in the future, Fox News has learned.    
A White House official told Fox News on Tuesday there is a procedure involving the Counsel’s office and family representatives to deal with such matters as they arise.

White House aides have grown concerned about the ethical implications of the vice president’s niece, Meena Harris, leveraging her aunt’s name to boost her brand.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp reacts on ‘Fox and Friends Weekend’ to Major League Baseball announcing it&#39;s pulling the All-Star game from the state over its new voting law.
Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie Sunday called out Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams for praising a New Jersey in-person early voting law that provides fewer days of pre-Election Day in-person voting than a Georgia measure President Biden has compared to Jim Crow laws.
The New Jersey bill was signed last week by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, while the Georgia bill became law with the signature of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp on March 25.
&#34;Stacey Abrams was in New Jersey, in my state, praising Phil Murphy this week for a voting law where New Jersey early voting is nine days — half of what Georgia’s is,&#34; Christie said during an appearance on &#34;This Week with George Stephanopoulos.&#34;
&#34;Yet she’s on TV in New Jersey — I saw it myself — saying that this is one of the greatest voting expansion bills we’ve ever seen,&#34; Christie said.
The New Jersey legislation allows nine days of in-person early voting at a limited number of polling places, beginning on the tenth day before an election and ending on the Sunday before Election Day.
GEORGIA GOV. KEMP HITS MLB, BIDEN AFTER ELECTION LAW PROMPTS ALL-STAR MOVE: NOTHING MORE THAN &#39;POLITICAL PLAY&#39;
Georgia&#39;s new voting law provides a minimum of 17 days of early in-person voting and a maximum of nineteen days, according to 
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
.
Abrams, who waged a failed campaign for governor against Kemp in 2018, did a virtual appearance with Murphy Tuesday, the day he signed the voting bill into law. She praised the state for &#34;leading the way on automatic voter registration.&#34;
Abrams touted the benefits of in-person early voting.
&#34;I am so excited to be looking up, looking at New Jersey, knowing that New Jersey is taking us in the right direction,&#34; she said.

&#34;To Governor Murphy, to the state legislature, to the secretary of state, and to all the allies who made this possible, you have my heartiest not only congratulations, but you have my gratitude because you are showing the way to a better democracy and a better future for us all.&#34;
&#34;While it is difficult for some folks to comprehend, leaders in states who expand rights should be praised, and leaders in states who restrict rights should not be,&#34; said Seth Bringman, spokesman for Fair Fight Action, a voting rights group launched by Abrams in 2018. 
&#34;I missed the part of the New Jersey bill that criminalized handing a voter a bottle of water,&#34; he said. &#34;We are thrilled Republicans now believe access to democracy should not depend on the state in which Americans live, so we look forward to their support of the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.&#34;

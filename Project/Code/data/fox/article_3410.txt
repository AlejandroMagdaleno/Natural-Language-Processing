The disclosure came on the same day that U.S. officials enacted sweeping sanctions against 32 Russian entities and individuals for a variety of infractions. The Biden administration said the Kremlin sought to interfere in the 2020 election and blamed Russian intelligence services for the SolarWinds hack, which breached many prominent federal agencies, including the Treasury and DOJ, as well as U.S. companies.
Russian hackers exploited vulnerabilities in the private supply chain as well as weaknesses in federal cyber defense, according to the government’s findings.
The sanctions block U.S. banks from buying bonds from the Russian Central Bank, hindering Russia’s ability to borrow money. Sanctions were imposed on six Russian companies that support the country’s cyber initiatives, and 10 Russian diplomats were expelled.

US officials warned they could take further action if Russia engages in similar behavior in the future.

George Washington University law professor provides insight as impeachment trial begins.
The Senate 
impeachment
 trial of former President Donald Trump began on Tuesday with opening statements and debate between House impeachment managers and Trump&#39;s defense lawyers.
The trial started just after 1 p.m. and saw four hours of debate total, divided between the House impeachment managers and Trump&#39;s counsel about whether the impeachment trial is constitutional.
The Senate then voted by simple majority on if the trial is constitutional.
Democrat officials have pushed to hold the trial, even though many Republicans have dubbed their efforts unconstitutional now that Trump has left office.

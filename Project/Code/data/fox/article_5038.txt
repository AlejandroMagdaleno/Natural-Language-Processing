Rep. 
Jamaal Bowman
, D-N.Y. has been accused of suggesting minorities are  incapable of successfully undergoing &#34;
standardized testing
.&#34;
Bowman, a former middle school principal who earlier this month called testing &#34;a pillar of systemic racism,&#34; shared a political cartoon on 
Twitter
 Monday that depicts a 
row of animals
 in front of a tree. The animals include a bird, a monkey, a penguin, an elephant, a fish, a seal, and a dog.
In front of them, a man sitting behind a desk tells the animals, &#34;For a fair selection everybody has to take the same exam: please climb that tree.&#34;
&#34;Our education system and the problem with standardized testing,&#34; Bowman tweeted alongside the cartoon.

Bowman&#39;s tweet was widely blasted on social media, with some calling it &#34;racist&#34; and comparing it to rhetoric from White supremacist David Duke. 
&#34;You&#39;re suggesting different students given a standardized test are like ... different species? Are you kidding me with this?&#34; Atlantic staff writer Conor Friedersdorf asked.
&#34;The neo-racism of &#39;anti-racism,&#39;&#34; journalist Bari Weiss reacted.
&#34;There are issues with standardized testing. This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, it,&#34; New York Times journalist Jane Coaston wrote. 
&#34;the woke spectrum: woke, extremely woke, ludicrously woke, alt-right,&#34; writer Allahpundit reacted.
&#34;&#39;Asking a [B]lack person to pass a test is like asking a goldfish to climb a tree.&#39; Who said it: David Duke or Jamaal Bowman?&#34; PJ Media columnist Jim Treacher tweeted.
&#34;Someone please explain to me how this isn&#39;t the most racist thing they&#39;ve seen on their feeds all day,&#34; Washington Examiner commentator Tiana Lowe said.

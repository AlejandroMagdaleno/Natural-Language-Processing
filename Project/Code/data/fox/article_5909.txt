FOX News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram recaps the memorial for officer who died in Jan. 6 Capitol riot
Democratic Rep. 
Maxine Waters
 of 
California 
Tuesday said she thinks former President 
Donald Trump
 should be charged with &#34;premeditated murder&#34; over the deadly 
riots at the U.S. Capitol 
on Jan. 6.
&#34;He absolutely should be charged with premeditated murder because of the lives that were lost for this invasion with his insurrection,&#34; she told MSNBC. &#34;For the president of the United States to sit and watch the invasion and the insurrection and not say a word because he knew he had absolutely initiated it – and as some of them said, ‘he invited us to come. We’re here at the invitation of the President of the United States.&#39;&#34;
Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died amid the chaos.
Waters voted with other House Democrats and 10 Republicans on Jan. 13 to 
impeach 
Trump for &#34;inciting an insurrection.&#34;
While arguing for Trump to be impeached last month, Waters, who was an outspoken critic during his entire presidency, said she believed he was capable of starting a &#34;civil war.&#34;
TRUMP IMPEACHMENT LAWYER CALLS OUT SENATE DEMS, SAYS EX-PRESIDENT HAS NO CHANCE OF &#39;FAIR AND FULL TRIAL&#39;
The Los Angeles-area congresswoman said she was locked in her office while rioters roamed through the Capitol and added that &#34;Because I took on this president early, I called for his impeachment early, I have been threatened time and time again.&#34;
She claimed the rioters had followed Trump’s lead before and during his Jan. 6 rally that questioned the Electoral College results and preceded the breach. 
MAXINE WATERS HAS GIVEN OVER $1 MILLION IN CAMPAIGN CASH TO DAUGHTER 
&#34;And even there’s information that some of the planning came out of individuals working in his campaign,&#34; she told 
MSNBC
. &#34;We have to fight as hard as we can to see to it that there’s some justice.&#34;
Republicans have also blamed Waters for her own heated rhetoric when she encouraged people to harass Trump administration officials in 2018 over its &#34;zero tolerance&#34; policy at the border.

&#34;Let’s make sure we show up wherever we have to show up,&#34; she told a California crowd. &#34;And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere. We’ve got to get the children connected to their parents.&#34;

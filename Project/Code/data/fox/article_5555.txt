Rep. Bob Good will introduce legislation Wednesday that would make teaching critical race theory in federally funded schools a civil rights violation, the Virginia Republican told Fox News.
&#34;We are introducing a bill that will make it a civil rights violation to teach critical race theory or anything resembling it by any other name in our schools,&#34; Good said of his legislation, the Protecting Students Civil Rights Act. &#34;It is judging students by their race, it&#39;s saying that their face determines their future, so we&#39;re trying to put a stop to that.&#34;
&#34;What we hope to accomplish is to advance Martin Luther King&#39;s principles, which were to judge people by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin,&#34; he continued. &#34;We don&#39;t believe that race defines a person.&#34;
Critical race theory
 has become a battleground issue in local school districts nationwide. Critics argue that it teaches students to view the world through a racial lens and divides the world into oppressors and the oppressed. Proponents say the theory details the role racism has played in America&#39;s history and isn&#39;t being taught to younger students.

&#34;We&#39;re not responsible for the sins of our past,&#34; Good told Fox News. &#34;Our race doesn&#39;t determine our future.&#34;

      Critical race theory has become a battleground issue in local school districts nationwide.
      
&#34;Our actions, our values, and the things we achieve as individuals determine our future,&#34; he added.
Good said his constituents&#39; concerns over what schools are instructing children, including teaching White kids that they are &#34;undeniably racist&#34; and oppressors, led to the bill. In contrast, Good said that schools teach Black students that they&#39;re &#34;undeniably a victim&#34; because of their race.
&#34;We don&#39;t believe that kids look at each other that way,&#34; Good told Fox News. &#34;We don&#39;t believe that most parents want their kids to be judged that way, so we&#39;re trying to stand up for our parents and our children.&#34;
In a press release provided to Fox News, Good&#39;s office said that over 5,000 educators have already signed a pledge to teach critical race theory in their schools. It further states that &#34;leftists have asserted made-up crisis, alienating those who are concerned by these profoundly divisive and un-American ideas.&#34;
The press release adds that the Biden administration&#39;s priorities for the 
Department of Education&#39;s
 American History and Civics Educations programs &#34;directly encourages the propagation of radical ideals, including the 1619 Project, as well as Ibram X. Kendi&#39;s ‘How to Be Anti-Racist,’ which directly advocates for discrimination.&#34;

Good will hold a press conference Wednesday afternoon on the bill with Citizens for Renewing America, a group led by 
Russ Vought
, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget under 
President Trump
.
&#34;Congressman Good&#39;s bill is the next key line of attack that both Washington and the states must take in the fight against state-sanctioned racism,&#34; Vought told Fox News. &#34;Teaching our children that they are less-than because of their skin color is indoctrination and a classic civil rights violation.&#34;
&#34;It&#39;s high time any school that behaves in this manner be held accountable,&#34; he continued.

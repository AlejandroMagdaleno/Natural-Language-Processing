Dan Quayle joins &#39;Special Report&#39; to discuss Biden inauguration 32 years after swearing-in as vice president
As the 
Republican Party
 moves on from the 
Trump administration
, it must &#34;separate the policies and accomplishments&#34; of the 45th president from his personality, former Vice President Dan Quayle told &#34;
Special Report
&#34; Tuesday. 
&#34;I would say the party is split. Time will tell whether we can get that back together or not,&#34; Quayle told chief political anchor Bret Baier. &#34;I think that we can.&#34;
The Indiana native added that &#34;from a political point of view, it&#39;s a lot easier to correct personalities than it is policies. There are not deep divisions in the Republican Party on policy. It&#39;s more about the personality of President Trump, and I think that&#39;s going to be fairly easy to correct with whoever the new leader in the party that emerges.&#34;
Quayle, who served as vice president between 1989 and 1993 under President George H.W. Bush, called Trump&#39;s planned absence from Wednesday&#39;s inauguration ceremony &#34;unfortunate.&#34;
DOZEN GUARDSMEN REMOVED FROM INAUGURATION OVER SUSPECTED FAR-RIGHT EXTREMIST TIES
&#34;I wish that he had or was going to attend the inauguration,&#34; said Quayle, who added that he believed he had been to every presidential inauguration since Jimmy Carter was sworn in as the 39th president in 1977.
&#34;I ... believe that somebody in my position really needs to show up to witness the transfer of power, the peaceful transfer of power,&#34; he said. &#34;It is a magical moment, something that American history has proven to be able to see through over, you know, centuries.&#34;

Quayle went on to say that we wished his former Senate colleague Joe Biden &#34;the very best.&#34;
&#34;I think it&#39;s important that we show up to show bipartisanship, show that Republicans and Democrats are united in trying to move this country forward,&#34; he said. &#34;And that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about.&#34;

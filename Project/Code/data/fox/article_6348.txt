What does the comment signal about how the Senate may handle impeachment? Jamil Jaffer, director of the National Security Law &amp;amp; Policy program at George Mason University, explains and weighs in on more &#39;Russiagate&#39; documents set for release.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski
, R-Alaska
,
 sounded the alarm about 
President Biden&#39;s
 oil restrictions, pressing his Interior secretary nominee, Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., on an executive order she said targeted her state.
&#34;When we see these executive orders coming out of the White House that not only impact a resource-based state like 
Alaska
, but actually call us out by name,&#34; she told Haaland during her confirmation hearing Tuesday. &#34;We&#39;re one of only two states in the nation that were specifically targeted by President Biden&#39;s Day One executive order,&#34; Murkowski said.
She seemed to be referring to Biden&#39;s executive order 
directing
 the Interior Department to place a temporary moratorium on oil and gas leasing activities in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Murkowski went on to say she didn&#39;t think Biden was &#34;out to get&#34; Alaskans but that she does think &#34;there is a definite threat to the resource industry that our state is blessed to be able to host.&#34;
BIDEN SIGNS CLIMATE CHANGE ORDERS AMID CONCERNS OVER JOBS: &#39;IT IS TIME TO ACT&#39;
Addressing Haaland, she asked her point-blank: &#34;So if you are confirmed to this very significant position, what is your approach going to be with regards to oil, and gas and mineral resource development within a state like Alaska?&#34;
Haaland responded in part by saying that she wanted to continue working with Murkowski and help Alaskans get the opportunities &#34;they need.&#34;

&#34;I know that President Biden doesn&#39;t want to cripple any state,&#34; she said.
&#34;He put the pause on the new leases in order to review the program. I want you to know that if I&#39;m confirmed, I will rely heavily on our relationship moving forward. I do want to work with you. I do want to make sure that I understand the unique issues in Alaska, and to make sure we are doing all we can to ensure that your constituents have the opportunities that they need.&#34;

Fox News&#39; Anita Vogel reports on Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., controversial tweet
Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne, D-
Iowa
, falsely claimed the 
Republican Party
 has &#34;way more dark money&#34; than the 
Democratic Party
 this past weekend.
Axne made the claim while speaking at the West Des Moines Democratic Party BBQ fundraiser on Saturday in a 
video
 obtained by Fox News.
&#34;We’ve got a lot of work ahead of us because, unfortunately, they’ve got a lot more dark money than we have,&#34; Axne claimed.
LIBERAL DARK MONEY GROUP 1630 FUND’S ELECTION WISHLIST BOOSTED BY SWISS BILLIONAIRE
&#34;That&#39;s not something that we believe in, but they sure do,&#34; Axne continued. &#34;They want to put out the lies that aren’t truthful so they can scare people into thinking things are happening when they really aren’t.&#34;
While dark money is pervasive in the political world, Axne’s claim of Republicans benefiting more from the campaign finance practice does not hold water.
According to 
OpenSecrets
, the website of the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics, liberal groups &#34;directed more than $514 million in dark money into the 2020 election, overshadowing around $200 million that boosted Republicans.&#34;
&#34;After years of dark money overwhelmingly boosting Republicans, this marks the first presidential election cycle where dark money benefited Democrats,&#34; the group wrote.
&#34;That&#39;s a continuation from the 2018 midterm elections when Democrats benefited from more dark money than their Republican counterparts at the federal level for the first time since Citizens United,&#34; they added.
Dark money groups like 
House Majority Forward
 – which is aligned with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and has paid for a 
couple
 
of ads 
supporting
 
Axne – are 501(c)(4) nonprofits that can raise as much money as they want without disclosing donors.

Additionally, the liberal dark money group the Sixteen Thirty Fund received $135 million from Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss’ foundation advocacy arm, the Berger Action Fund, between 2016 and 2020.
Axne 
tweeted
 
last January about her being a founding member of the End Corruption Caucus, writing that she and the other members were &#34;fighting the Washington status quo, taking on special interest groups, and getting dark money out of politics.&#34;
She also came under fire for invoking the 
Civil War
 
while defending the Democrats’ ultimately doomed election overhaul bill H.R. 1 at a town hall meeting last month.
The Iowa Democrat&#39;s campaign did not respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.

Fox News Congressional correspondent Aishah Hasnie gives the latest on lawmakers&#39; reactions to the withdrawal in Afghanistan on &#39;The Story&#39;
President Biden
 appears to have broken his promise to stay in 
Afghanistan
 until every American is evacuated. 
Marine Corps Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. announced Monday evening that the last of the U.S. 
troops
 stationed at the Kabul airport had left, completing the military’s drawdown in the country, even though hundreds of Americans likely remain.
McKenzie, commander of U.S. Central Command, said some American citizens who wanted to leave Afghanistan remained in the country. 
AFGHANISTAN: NUMBER OF AMERICANS SEEKING EVACUATION BEFORE DEADLINE &#39;BELOW 250,&#39; OFFICIAL SAYS
&#34;We did not get everybody out that we wanted to get out,&#34; he said.
President Biden told ABC News&#39; George Stephanopoulos during an interview on Aug. 18 that the U.S. military objective in Afghanistan was to get &#34;everyone&#34; out, including Americans and Afghan allies and their families. 
&#34;That&#39;s what we&#39;re doing now, that&#39;s the path we&#39;re on. And I think we&#39;ll get there,&#34; he said. &#34;If there&#39;s American citizens left, we&#39;re gonna stay to get them all out.&#34;
A senior State Department official told Fox News on Monday that there remained a &#34;small number&#34; of Americans inside Afghanistan. 
That official put the number of Americans at &#34;below 250,&#34; adding that some additional Americans have departed Afghanistan in recent hours. The official added that the State Department also was committed to evacuating &#34;those who worked with us,&#34; referring to Afghan &#34;partners.&#34;

The announced end of the withdrawal came less than a day before the official deadline agreed to by the Taliban, which was 3:29 p.m. ET Tuesday – 11:59 p.m. local time in Kabul, U.S. defense officials told Fox News.
The Taliban have said they will allow normal travel after the U.S. withdrawal, once they assume control of the airport.

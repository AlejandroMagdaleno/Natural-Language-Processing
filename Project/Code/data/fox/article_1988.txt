Arizona sheriff Mark Lamb discusses significant increase in single adult and unaccompanied minor migrant crossings throughout the state.
An 
Arizona
 sheriff said Wednesday that the current 
border
 crisis is worse than the 
Obama
 years, as the 
Department of Homeland Security
 indicates that the migrant surge at the U.S.-Mexico border is expected to hit a 20-year high.
Pinal Country Sheriff Mark Lamb told 
&#34;Fox &amp; Friends&#34;
 that it was &#34;ridiculous&#34; and &#34;unfair&#34; that illegal immigrants, many of whom he claims have not been tested for coronavirus, are able to enter the country while schools and businesses in many parts of the nation remain closed.
&#34;[During the Obama administration] it was like the Wild West out there in the desert on the south end of our county and we’re back to that again,&#34; Lamb said.
&#34;Almost every time we go out we’re finding 20 people. Last Wednesday, we had 49 apprehensions in my county. So this is just as bad as it was back in the Obama days, probably worse and on target to be worse.&#34;
DHS CHIEF SAYS BORDER NUMBERS ON TRACK TO BE HIGHEST IN 20 YEARS, CONCEDES SITUATION IS &#39;DIFFICULT
Lamb also accused the Biden administration of playing the &#34;blame game,&#34; targeting former President 
Trump’s
 border policies as the reason for the recent surge.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday 
referred
 to the influx of migrants at the southern border as a &#34;big problem&#34; and blamed the Trump administration for an &#34;unworkable system&#34; — following weeks of the Biden administration refusing to call it a &#34;crisis.&#34;
&#34;We recognize this is a big problem,&#34; Psaki said during a press briefing with reporters. &#34;The last administration left us a dismantled and unworkable system and, like any other problem, we are going to do all we can to solve it.&#34; 
When asked if the Biden administration is able to handle the unprecedented amount of migrants arriving at the border, Psaki insisted, &#34;We certainly do.&#34;
But Lamb claims that the halting of Trump’s border wall has allowed the Mexican cartel to smuggle people and drugs through gaps in the now-abandoned border construction sites in alarming numbers.

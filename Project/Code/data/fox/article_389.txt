Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 is &#34;inclined to say yes&#34; to calls by progressive organizations and at least one fellow Democrat in 
Congress
 for 82-year-old 
Supreme Court
 Justice Stephen Breyer to retire at the end of the current term of the high court.
Ocasio-Cortez, the two-term representative from New York who’s arguably the most high profile progressive in Congress and the most well-known of the group of diverse of lawmakers on the left known as &#34;the Squad,&#34; was asked Sunday 
in an interview
 on CNN’s &#34;State of the Union&#34; whether Breyer should retire.
OCASIO-CORTEZ URGES SENATE DEMOCRATS TO ‘MOVE NOW&#39; TO PASS DEMOCRATS&#39; AGENDA
&#34;You know, I – it&#39;s something that I’d think about but I, I would probably lean towards yes. But yes, you&#39;re asking me this question so I&#39;ve just, I would give more thought to it, but, but I&#39;m inclined to say yes,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez answered.
Some progressive are urging Breyer to step down now – while the Democrats control both the White House and the Senate, which confirms Supreme Court justices – so he can be succeed by another younger but equally progressive-minded justice.
Earlier in the CNN interview, host Dana Bash asked Ocasio-Cortez if she agreed with comments in April by Democratic 
Rep. Mondaire Jones of New York
 urging Breyer to retire, she said &#34;I believe Representative Jones has a point.&#34;
Mondaire in April argued that &#34;there’s no question&#34; that Breyer should step down, adding &#34;my goodness, have we not learned our lesson?&#34;
The late progressive leaning justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg resisted calls during President Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House to retire. Her death last year at age 87 – during then-President Trump’s term in office and while the Republicans still controlled the Senate – allowed Trump to place a third conservative justice on the Supreme Court.

Ocasio-Cortez during the interview also raised concerns over President Biden’s Department of Justice for recent moves that are being questioned and criticized by progressives.
&#34;The actions of Biden’s DOJ have been extremely concerning,&#34; the congresswoman emphasized. She argued that &#34;across the board ... we aren’t seeing a transformational DOJ that I think people had been looking forward to and that is something that deserves a lot more questions.&#34;

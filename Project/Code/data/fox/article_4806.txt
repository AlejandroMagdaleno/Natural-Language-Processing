&#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39; host warns of H.R.1.&#39;s danger to democracy
Twenty Republican state attorneys general signed a letter denouncing the House Democrats’ controversial election reform bill as unconstitutional for a slew of reasons just hours before the measure was expected to be voted on.
The 
letter
 — led by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita — tore into H.R. 1, the &#34;For the People Act,&#34; a 
massive 
election reform bill and a leading priority for House Democrats this Congress.
&#34;This monstrosity of a bill betrays the Constitution, dangerously federalizes state elections, and undermines the integrity of the ballot box,&#34; Rokita said in a statement to Fox News. &#34;As a former chief election officer, and now an Attorney General, I know this would be a disaster for election integrity and confidence in the processes that have been developed over time to instill confidence in the idea of ‘one person, one vote.’&#34;
The attorneys general said the bill &#34;betrays several Constitutional deficiencies and alarming mandates&#34; that would &#34;federalize&#34; statewide elections across America and that &#34;states have principal —and with presidential elections, exclusive — responsibility to safeguard&#34; how they hold elections under the Constitution.
&#34;The Act would invert that constitutional structure, commandeer state resources, confuse and muddle elections procedures, and erode faith in our elections and systems of governance,&#34; they wrote.
They then warned lawmakers that they &#34;may wish to consider the Act’s constitutional vulnerabilities as well as the policy critiques of state officials.&#34;
MCCARTHY WARNS DEMOCRAT-BACKED HR 1 IS A PELOSI POWER GRAB MEANT TO ERODE ELECTION CONFIDENCE
The twenty attorneys general marched on in their letter, arguing that the For the People Act &#34;implicates the Electors Clause&#34; of the Constitution. The Electors Clause guarantees each state legislature the right to &#34;direct allotment of presidential electors, and separately affords Congress only the more limited power to ‘determine the Time of chusing the Electors.’&#34;
The attorneys general argued that this &#34;exclusive division of power&#34; outlined in the Constitution &#34;differs markedly&#34; from the Election Clause in Article I of the Constitution, &#34;which says that both States and Congress have the power to regulate the &#39;time, place, and manner’ of congressional elections.&#34;
&#34;That distinction is not an accident of drafting,&#34; wrote the multi-state legal team. &#34;After extensive debate, the Constitution’s Framers deliberately excluded Congress from deciding how presidential electors would be chosen in order to avoid presidential dependence on Congress for position and authority.&#34;
The group then pointed to the 1892 Supreme Court case 
McPherson v. Blacker
 that &#34;[upheld] a Michigan statute apportioning presidential electors by district.&#34;
&#34;The exclusivity of state power to &#39;define the method&#39; of choosing presidential electors means that Congress may not force states to permit presidential voting by mail or curbside voting, for example,&#34; the group wrote.
The group pointed to a 2019 opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts, where Roberts &#34;noted with respect to congressional elections, the Framers &#39;assign[ed] the issue to the state legislatures, expressly checked and balanced by the Federal Congress.&#39;&#34; They then blasted the bill as not having Congress act &#34;as a check, but is instead overreaching by seizing the role of principal election regulator.&#34;
The attorneys general torched the bill’s &#34;constitutional deficiencies&#34; as &#34;only the beginning of the Act’s problems&#34; and that, &#34;[a]s a matter of election administration policy, it is difficult to imagine a legislative proposal more threatening to election integrity and voter confidence.&#34;
They took aim at the For the People Act’s &#34;limitations&#34; on voter identification laws, roasting the act as doing &#34;little to ensure voters say who they are&#34; and pointing out that &#34;requiring&#34; a government ID to vote in an election &#34;represents nothing more than a best practice for election administration.&#34;
&#34;Government-issued photo identification has been the global standard for documentary identification for decades,&#34; the lawyers wrote, saying that &#34;nearly twenty years ago&#34; the Help America Vote Act required proof of identification for &#34;first-time voters who register by mail without proof of identification.&#34;
They continued on to say that Help America Vote Act &#34;required&#34; said voters to &#34;present identification either to the county voter-registration office or at the polls.&#34;

&#34;Worse, it vitiates the capacity of voter ID requirements to protect against improper interference with voting rights,&#34; the letter reads. The attorneys general went on to say the act was &#34;not a fair election law&#34; as it does not &#34;treat all voters equally.&#34;
The letter also argued that the bill would &#34;limit how states maintain voter registration rolls&#34; while ensuring integrity in elections, saying that &#34;under the act,&#34; states &#34;could not use a combination of voter inactivity and unresponsiveness to maintain voter lists.&#34; Instead, under the act states may &#34;remove illegitimate voter registrations&#34; when officials have &#34;some other unspecified &#39;objective and reliable evidence&#39;&#34; that the person isn&#39;t eligible to vote.
The attorneys general wrote that &#34;this attack on reliable methods&#34; states have been using to &#34;maintain voter lists without specifying any reasonable permissible alternatives belies any actual interest in preventing voter fraud.&#34;
&#34;The objective, rather, seems to be to prevent meaningful voter list maintenance altogether,&#34; the letter read.
The lawyers then slammed the &#34;so-called ‘independent&#39; commissions&#34; that states would be required to use when redrawing congressional district lines after each census under the For the People Act. The attorneys wrote that the &#34;aim&#34; of the &#34;provision&#34; was to end &#34;&#39;political gerrymandering&#39;&#34; and that the reason behind the provision was the &#34;incoherent supposition that drawing congressional districts is something other than a political act.&#34;
They argued that, &#34;as with any legislation,&#34; redrawing congressional districts &#34;requires officials to balance legitimate competing considerations, and in so doing advance some political interests over others.&#34;
&#34;At least when legislatures draw boundary lines voters may punish egregious behavior at the next election; not so with government-by-commission, which trades accountability for mythical expertise and disinterest,&#34; the team wrote.
&#34;With respect to political redistricting, no ideal, perfectly balanced congressional boundaries exist, so we should let the people decide, through their elected officials, where to place them,&#34; they continued.
To round off their letter calling on Congress to rethink H.R. 1, the attorneys general blasted the bill’s &#34;requirement that political speakers disclose their donor lists.&#34; The group said the bill &#34;reflects an objective to name, shame, and blacklist&#34; those who have &#34;different or minority viewpoints.&#34;
&#34;In other words, the goal is to censor those with whom the authors of the bill disagree,&#34; wrote the attorneys general.
&#34;In the American tradition, the antidote for bad speech is more speech, not less,&#34; they continued. &#34;When people and organizations carry their chosen messages into the public arena, government should not cater to those who would intimidate or disrupt that same speech.&#34;

Chicago Mayor 
Lori Lightfoot
 declared racism a public health emergency Thursday, pointing to systematic racism as a leading factor in life expectancy discrepancies across the city.
Joined by the Chicago Department of Public Health, Lightfoot said there is a 9.2-year life expectancy gap between Black and non-Black Chicagoans.
&#34;At almost every single point in our city&#39;s history, racism has taken a devastating toll on the health and well-being of our residents of color – especially those who are Black,&#34; Lightfoot said in a statement. &#34;Without formally acknowledging this detrimental impact, we will never be able to move forward as a city and fully provide our communities with the resources they need to live happy and healthy lives.&#34;

The Chicago mayor said she was &#34;doubling down&#34; on both ongoing and new collaborations between city officials and community leaders to address racism in the Windy City.
Lightfoot said the city would be implementing a &#34;will to act&#34; initiative that will focus on addressing the impacts of historical policies like Jim Crow restrictions, redlining, and &#34;other forms of financial and housing segregation and discrimination.&#34;
The city’s public health department said it will allocate nearly $10 million in coronavirus relief funds from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish six Healthy Chicago Equity Zones that will encompass the entire city.
&#34;The launch of the Healthy Chicago Equity Zones is an extension of the racial and health equity work implemented by community leaders, public health entities, city government, and health institutions,&#34; said Ayesha Jaco, executive director of West Side United, a community-based initiative for Chicago’s western neighborhoods.

&#34;COVID-19 brought to the surface these inequities in our city and our society, but they’ve always been there, and they’ve always been a focus of the work we do at CDPH,&#34; health commissioner Allison Arwady said Thursday.
Lightfoot
 called the data a &#34;stark reminder of the legacy of unacceptable inequities&#34; that continue to affect Black Chicagoans.

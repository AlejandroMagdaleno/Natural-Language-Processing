Louisiana Senator weighs in Biden&#39;s ATF nominee, potential origins of COVID and latest Hunter Biden scandal on &#39;Hannity&#39;
Republican
 Sen. John Kennedy
 of 
Louisiana
 formally launched his 
2022 
re-election campaign on Tuesday, promising to his constituents that &#34;come hell or high water —your values will be my values, and I will never be silent — never — when the nut jobs tell me to sit down and shut up.&#34;
Kennedy, 
in a video
 announcing his 
Senate
 re-election, also pledged that &#34;I will not let you down — I’d rather drink weed killer.&#34;
The senator touted that &#34;in the last five years, we’ve accomplished a lot,&#34; but he charged that &#34;now the socialists are racing to undo it all. So, my job —our job — isn’t finished. Today, I’m announcing that I’m running for re-election for the United States Senate.&#34;
KENNEDY RIPS DEMOCRATIC BILL AS ‘ORGY OF SPENDING’
And Kennedy highlighted that &#34;with this announcement, I want to make you a new promise: I promise that I will always be your voice during the good times and the bad. I promise I will be a voice against the socialism that’s now overtaken Washington, D.C.&#34;
Kennedy, who will turn 70 this November, served 17 years as Louisiana state treasurer. In 2007, the one-time Democrat switched parties, becoming a Republican. After unsuccessful runs for the Senate in 2004 and 2008, he won the open-seat election in 2016, trouncing his rival 61%-39% in the December runoff.

The conservative lawmaker was a strong supporter of 
President Trump
 and was one of eight Senate Republicans who on Jan. 6. – hours after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by right-wing extremists aiming to disrupt congressional certification of now-
President Biden’s
 victory over Trump – objected to election certification.
In early March, well before Kennedy announced his re-election, Trump endorsed the senator in 2022.
Kennedy&#39;s campaign tells Fox News the senator&#39;s raised roughly $9.5 million so far this cycle for his re-election, with more than $7 million cash-on-hand.

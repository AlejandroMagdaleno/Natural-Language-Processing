&#39;The Madness of Crowds&#39; author Douglas Murray provides insight on ‘Fox and Friends.’
A college student at a school in New York said that she and other students were the target of a &#34;
cancel culture
 campaign&#34; that resulted in them not being able to form a Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) chapter.
Hannah Davis and two of her fellow classmates at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York, wanted to form a YAL chapter at their school. Their goal was to promote freedom of speech on college campuses and destroy &#34;group think.&#34;
Davis and her classmates then came under attack from an alleged &#34;cancel culture campaign&#34; that included a Change.org petition and not only targeted their burgeoning organization, but the students themselves.
The alleged &#34;cancel culture campaign&#34; led to their YAL chapter being rejected for organization on campus by the Student Government Association.

&#34;A cancel culture campaign was organized against us which they coined as holding students accountable for their actions,&#34; Davis told the 
Times-Union
, which first broke the story. &#34;YAL at Skidmore has not participated in any of the hateful behavior that they want us to take accountability for.&#34;
&#34;This idea of collectivized guilt resulted in members of our chapter being forced to leave due to harassment,&#34; Davis added. &#34;I have been subjected to endless harassment, false accusations and threats of violence in which Skidmore has been slow in addressing properly.&#34;
The 
petition 
against the formation of a YAL chapter at Skidmore claimed that the national YAL group had engaged &#34;pattern of racism, homophobia, and transphobia cannot be disputed.&#34;
It also alleged the school had become &#34;increasingly hostile&#34; to students of color and that it was &#34;no coincidence that this club is being proposed following months of bold activism by students of color.&#34;

The Student Government Association told Davis that &#34;concerns of hate speech and making students on campus feel unsafe&#34; were the reasons for the rejection. Davis alleged the Student Government Association’s decision was biased.
Skidmore College President Mark Connor told the Times-Union that the decision for a YAL chapter to be established at the school fell to the Student Government Association.
&#34;The student leaders whom our students have elected as their representatives have the right to vote to decide the outcome of this process,&#34; Conner said in a statement to the Times-Union. &#34;This is an important part of the educative experience for our students as they freely conduct their affairs and think about public discourse, civic engagement and campus culture.&#34;
&#34;These fundamental rights apply to all, regardless of political persuasion or other differences, including views and beliefs,&#34; Conner added. &#34;The rare exception would be hate speech, in which violence is clearly the goal, which would not be tolerated in our community. As always, I encourage all members of our community to exercise their freedom of speech and freedom of association and to engage with each other with patience, courtesy and respect for one another.&#34;
Skidmore College, the college’s Student Government Association and YAL did not immediately respond to Fox News’ requests for comment.

The censorship of conservatives — and now libertarians — at colleges and universities across the country has grown, but the students are fighting back.
Recently, two University of Chicago students, Audrey Unverferth and Evita Duffy, founded a college student-run 
newspaper 
dedicated to conservative and libertarian viewpoints.
The motto for their new venture? &#34;Outthink the mob.&#34;

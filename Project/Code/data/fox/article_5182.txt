The &#39;America Reports&#39; co-anchor clarifies previous reporting on a University of Michigan study regarding Biden&#39;s climate change goals. 
U.S. Special Climate Envoy John Kerry on Monday denied allegations that while he was serving as secretary of state under Barack Obama he informed the 
Iranian
 foreign minister of Israeli operations in Syria.
In a Twitter post, Kerry called the claims – detailed in leaked audio obtained by several media outlets – ‘unequivocally false.’
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif alleged in the audio that Kerry told him that Israel had struck around 200 Iranian targets in Syria.
The Iranian leader admitted he was shocked by the purported admission, as reported by The New York Times.
Republicans were quick to jump on the reports as a betrayal to Israel – a key U.S. ally in the region – with some even calling for Kerry’s resignation from his post in the Biden administration.

Women&#39;s human rights group warns of &#39;complete obliteration of biological sex&#39; on &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39;
Women&#39;s Human Rights Campaign member and outspoken feminist Kara Dansky ramped up warnings against 
President Biden&#39;s
 gender identity initiative on Tuesday, telling &#34;
Tucker Carlson Tonight
&#34; that America is heading for a &#34;complete obliteration of biological sex&#34;.
Biden
 issued an 
executive order
 on Jan. 20 encouraging schools to allow student-athletes to compete in sports based on their gender identity instead of their biological sex.  On Monday, Biden signed an
 additional measure
 that &#34;seeks to erase women and girls in the law as a category,&#34; Dansky said.
&#34;What we&#39;re seeing is a complete obliteration of biological sex, and we have to stop doing that,&#34; she told Carlson.
BIDEN EXECUTIVE ORDER SAYS SCHOOLS SHOULD INCLUDE TRANSGENDER ATHLETES IN GIRLS&#39; SPORTS
Biden&#39;s executive order, dubbed the Executive Order on Preventing and Combatting Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation, is aimed at providing children a place to &#34;learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room or school sports,&#34; the administration said in a statement. 
Dansky urged the White House to engage in a &#34;serious national conversation about what we&#39;re doing before we push through laws that redefine the word &#39;sex&#39; to include the nebulous, ill-defined, un-understood, made-up lie that is gender identity.&#34;

&#34;This is an emergency,&#34; she added. &#34;This is an absolute emergency. It has consequences and as a feminist, as you know, I care really about the rights, privacy, and safety of women and girls. But I also understand that the obliteration of sex has consequences that are extremely far-reaching.&#34;

West Virginia
 
Democratic
 
Sen. Joe Manchin
 says removing Sens. 
Josh Hawley
, R-Mo., and 
Ted Cruz
, R-Texas, over their objections to the 
2020 presidential election
 
results
 should be &#34;a consideration.&#34; 
In an interview Friday on PBS&#39;s &#34;Firing Line,&#34; Manchin said the senators
&#39;
 insistence on objecting to 
Pennsylvania’s
 
Electoral College votes
 even after supporters of 
President Trump
 
stormed the U.S. Capitol
 was &#34;totally unconscionable&#34; and triggering the 14th Amendment is now an option. 
HAWLEY DEFENDS OBJECTION TO ELECTORAL COLLEGE RESULTS: &#39;I WILL NOT BOW TO A LAWLESS MOB&#39;
The third section of the amendment states that
 no lawmaker holding office &#34;shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.&#34;
Congress may &#34;by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability,&#34; the section states.
Added to the Constitution after the Civil War, the amendment was designed to cover instances of sedition, Manchin 
told host Margaret Hoover
.
&#34;That those people should never hold public office, they should never have the public microphone, they should never be allowed to be in a position of power or of decision-making, or purpose, because they&#39;re going to serve themselves,&#34; he said.
&#34;Would you support, senator, the removal of Sen. Hawley and Sen. Cruz through the 14th Amendment, Section 3?&#34; Hoover asked.
&#34;Well, they should look, absolutely,&#34; he said, referring to the Senate. &#34;I mean, basically, that should be a consideration.&#34;
Cruz &#34;understands that,&#34; Manchin added. &#34;Ted&#39;s a very bright individual, and I get along fine with Ted. But what he did was totally outside the realm of our responsibilities or our privileges that we have.&#34;
None of the senators immediately responded to requests for comment from Fox News.

Washington, D.C.
, U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin told reporters Friday that investigator would have more than 300 open criminal cases by the end of the day.
Democrats have accused Hawley and Cruz of 
inciting Trump supporters for political gain
, a charge the senators have vehemently denied.
In an interview with Politico
 last week, Cruz said he was debating principle, 
law
 and the Constitution, which he said is &#34;the exact opposite of inciting violence.&#34;
CRUZ WILL ATTEND BIDEN INAUGURATION
Manchin, however, said there was &#34;no way&#34; the Republican senators could not be considered complicit in the day&#39;s events.
&#34;That they think they can walk away and say ‘I just exercised my right as a senator?’ Especially after we came back here and after they saw what happened,&#34; he said.
&#34;I want to see all of those people that made the objection and stuck with their objection ... were you sending out 
fundraising
 requests while this was going on -- the insurrection to our Capitol -- tell me that,&#34; he told PBS.

Cruz and Hawley were also slammed for 
sending out fundraising messages
 to their constituents as rioters pushed toward the Capitol&#39;s doors. 
Responding to a tweet
 from 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y., on Jan. 7, Cruz said he told his team to halt fundraising &#34;within minutes&#34; of the attack and denied that debating the formation of a commission to review election results &#34;somehow supports 
terrorist violence
.&#34;
Hawley -- though not mentioning his fundraising efforts -- wrote a 
Wednesday op-ed in The Missouri Times
 blasting &#34;much of the 
media
&#34; and &#34;many members of the Washington establishment&#34; who &#34;want to deceive Americans into thinking those who raised concerns incited violence, simply by voicing the concern.&#34;
&#34;Some wondered why I stuck with my objection following the violence at the Capitol,&#34; Hawley added. &#34;The reason is simple: I will not bow to a lawless mob, or allow criminals to drown out the legitimate concerns of my constituents.&#34;
Hawley said constituents had contacted him about concerns over election integrity after Trump&#39;s loss in states he doesn&#39;t represent.

Manchin said that he has talked with Hawley he could tell the matter is &#34;weighing on him.&#34;
Both senators
 are 
facing calls to resign
 for continuing their objections to an election in which allegations of widespread voter fraud have been debunked and tossed out of court.

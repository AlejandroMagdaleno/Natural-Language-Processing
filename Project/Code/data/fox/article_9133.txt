The former Trump campaign senior adviser said the &#34;outpouring&#34; of support for the former president, including spontaneous parades in Florida, has been &#34;so incredible.&#34; She explained that these supporters simply love America and want to thank &#34;their president&#34; Donald Trump -- so they deserve a &#34;thanks&#34; in return.

Trump mentioned that the former president has been advising his followers to stay tuned and even alluded to the possibility of running for office again in 2024.
&#34;He is the head of the Republican Party,&#34; she said. &#34;He is really the person that everyone will continue to turn to in order to help them get across the line… This man has changed politics and he has changed our party.&#34;

A Swiss artist memorialized Vice President 
Kamala Harris&#39;
 history-making win in a 
shattered glass installation
 that&#39;s on display in Washington, D.C., outside the Lincoln Memorial.
Simon Berger carefully cracked glass to create a 6-by-6-foot, 350-pound unconventional portrait of the first woman, the first person of color elected to the nation&#39;s second-highest office.

Berger began his work after the results of the November election and modeled his artwork after a picture of Harris captured by photographer Celeste Sloman. The glass portrait was shipped from Switzerland.
The project was commissioned by the 
National Women’s History Museum
 and Chief, a networking organization for female executives. The artwork was unveiled Thursday at the Lincoln Memorial.
&#34;I think what makes it so moving to me is to see the tiny cracks, to see those fissures and everything they represent,&#34; Lindsay Kaplan, a co-founder of Chief, 
Told the Associated Press

Harris broke the glass ceiling not only for women but for Asian Americans and Black Americans, too. She&#39;s the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants and previously the first Black person to represent California in the U.S. Senate.

Harris acknowledged her historical win in a speech after the election in November.
&#34;While I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,&#34; she said in a 
victory speech
 in Wilmington, Del. &#34;Because every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.&#34;

The L.A. school board, which has faced legal battles over its strict COVID-19 policies, is &#34;likely to be approved as a majority of board members already have said that they either favor or are leaning toward such a requirement,&#34; according to a report from the 
Los Angles Times.
As part of the nation&#39;s second-largest school system, Los Angeles school students and employees are tested each week and must wear face masks while indoor and outdoor. All employees for the school system have already been required to get the vaccine.
The 
Times 
also noted in its report that the &#34;board would not likely have approved a special meeting over a vaccine mandate if it wasn’t clear that the board would approve it,&#34; adding that the topic of a vaccine mandate for school children &#34;has apparently come up in at least two closed sessions.&#34;

 released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that, as of August 29, 48% of county residents 12 to 15 years old and 57% of residents ages 16 to 17 were fully vaccinated.
On Wednesday, school board member Nick Melvoin implied that he intended to vote in favor of the mandate, saying &#34;scientific consensus&#34; proves everyone who is eligible to get a vaccine should do so.
&#34;Our goal is to keep kids and teachers as safe as possible and in the classroom,&#34; Melvoin 
said
, according to the 
Times
. &#34;A medical and scientific consensus has emerged that the best way to protect everyone in our schools and communities is for all those who are eligible to get vaccinated. This policy is the best way to make that happen.&#34;
The meeting will be held at 5 p.m. ET on Thursday evening.

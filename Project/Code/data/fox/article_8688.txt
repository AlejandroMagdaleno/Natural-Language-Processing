Charlie Kirk, Democrat strategist Tezlyn Figaro and FOX News contributor Kiron Skinner debate the week that was in Washington
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., hit out at &#34;scum and liars&#34; in the media and &#34;weak politicos&#34; after a document about an 
America First Caucus
 leaked to the press and sparked outrage over what critics said was &#34;nativist&#34; language -- but Taylor Greene said was a draft by staff that she hadn’t read.
On Thursday, I buried my father and held my mother’s hand as we said goodbye,&#34; she said. &#34;On Friday, sick and evil POS in the media attacked me with phrases I never said or wrote.
MCCARTHY ISSUES APPARENT REBUKE OF GOP CAUCUS PLATFORM PROMOTING &#39;ANGLO-SAXON POLITICAL TRADITIONS&#39;
&#34;They released a staff level draft proposal from an outside group that I hadn’t read,&#34; she said.
Punchbowl News
 first reported the document, in which the caucus says it will &#34;follow in President Trump’s footsteps, and potentially step on some toes and sacrifice sacred cows for the good of the American nation.&#34;
The platform includes calls for increased infrastructure spending, moves against election fraud, divesting power from the federal government, a crackdown on Big Tech, a tighter immigration system, a cut in foreign aid and an end to lockdowns.
But it drew ire from Democrats and some Republicans when it said that &#34;America is a nation with a border, and a culture, strengthened by a common respect for uniquely Anglo-Saxon political traditions.&#34;
On infrastructure, the group also promotes buildings with &#34;architectural, engineering and aesthetic value that befits the progeny of European architecture.&#34; 
While a number of Democrats and media outlets criticized the document, with Punchbowl describing it as &#34;nakedly nativist,&#34; it also picked up criticism from House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy who tweeted that GOP is not built on &#34;identity, race, or religion&#34; and is &#34;the party of Lincoln &amp; the party of more opportunity for all Americans -- not nativist dog whistles.&#34;
Taylor Greene pushed back against the criticism, and referred to prior allegations (that she denied) that she believed lasers caused wildfires in California.
&#34;The scum and liars in the media are calling me a racist by taking something out of context. This is just a repeat of &#34;Jewish Space Lasers.&#34; Another term I never used and the media made up,&#34; she said.
She also appeared to hit back at criticism coming from her side of the political aisle.
&#34;The hyenas in the media are terrified. So are the Democrats. And so are the weak politicos that float around whichever the wind blows,&#34; she said.
As for the caucus, she said that she has plans &#34;to drive President Trump’s America First agenda with my Congressional colleagues but we won’t let the media or anyone else push the narrative.&#34;
Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, had told reporters he was &#34;looking at&#34; joining the America First caucus.  When asked about references to &#34;Anglo-Saxon&#34; influence, he said he &#34;hadn&#39;t seen that.&#34;

&#34;It&#39;s not supposed to be about race at all,&#34; Gohmert said.
Punchbowl
 reported that Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., would be part of the group while Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., tweeted Friday that he will be joining the caucus.

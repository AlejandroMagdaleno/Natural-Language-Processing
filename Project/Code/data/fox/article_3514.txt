The Massachusetts Democrat has a 
picture book
 out this fall called &#34;Pinkie Promises&#34; in honor of a favorite campaign ritual. When meeting a girl supporter, Warren would introduce herself by saying, &#34;My name is Elizabeth, and I&#39;m running for president because that&#39;s what girls do,&#34; then seal their bond with a pinky promise. 
A portion of the author&#39;s proceeds for &#34;Pinkie Promises&#34; will be donated to several Massachusetts chapters of Girls Inc., a nonprofit that encourages girls to &#34;be strong, smart, and bold, through direct service and advocacy.&#34;

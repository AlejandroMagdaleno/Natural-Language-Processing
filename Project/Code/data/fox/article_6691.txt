The DHS &#39;encourages all individuals, regardless of immigration status, to receive the COVID-19 vaccine once eligible.&#39; Kristin Fisher reports.
Federal authorities have charged a 
North Carolina
 man with threatening violence against President Biden, the 
Justice Department
 announced on Thursday.
Kyle Reeves, a 27-year-old resident of Gastonia, 
appeared before
 a federal judge in Charlotte following his arrest last Friday on a charge of making a threat against the president. 
Prosecutors say Reeves contacted the White House switchboard &#34;multiple times&#34; and &#34;made threats against President Biden and others.&#34;
The phone calls were made between Jan. 28 and Feb. 1, according to the federal affidavit. Reeves is alleged to have repeated the threats in multiple phone calls to a Secret Service agent who contacted him to discuss his remarks, as well as in calls with the Capitol Police switchboard.
&#34;I’m going to come kill the president, I’m going to kill the Secret Service because I own this whole planet,&#34; Reeves told a Secret Service special agent, according to an affidavit first obtained by the 
Charlotte Observer

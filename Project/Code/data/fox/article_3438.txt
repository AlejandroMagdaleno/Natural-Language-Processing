Fox News correspondent Casey Stegall has the latest on conference speakers on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Donald Trump Jr.
 took aim at several high-profile targets during a fiery speech at 
CPAC
 in Dallas.
Trump Jr. began his unscripted remarks on Friday by touting how his father, former 
President Donald Trump
, was &#34;right&#34; about &#34;everything,&#34; highlighting the coronavirus lab-leak theory that was widely dismissed by Democrats and members of the media last year. 
&#34;At what point in time in these morons&#39; minds, I don&#39;t know, the Wuhan lab-leak theory not the most plausible argument in the year 2020?&#34; Trump Jr. asked. 
Trump Jr. mocked the lab-leak deniers, sparking laugher in the audience.
DONALD TRUMP JR. SAYS HE&#39;LL BE ‘VERY INVOLVED’ ON 2022 CAMPAIGN TRAIL
&#34;Don&#39;t laugh- you&#39;re not canceled. Congratulations,&#34; Trump Jr. quipped. &#34;By laughing, you would have been thrown off every social media platform, you would have been thrown out of a job in science because, you know, science no longer follows the rules of physics, right? They don&#39;t follow math, they follow the narrative dictated by CNN because that is able to manipulate the rules of physics.&#34;
Trump Jr. lamented that &#34;the world is going to hell&#34; under the Biden administration, pointing to rising gas prices. He knocked the White House&#39;s tweet touting the 16-cent savings from this year&#39;s Fourth of July barbeque. And he took a swipe at White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki for pushing the &#34;narrative&#34; that it was Republicans, not Democrats, who are in favor of &#34;defunding the police.&#34;
&#34;Jen Psaki told me so, so it must be true!&#34; he exclaimed. &#34;Is that true or did you see that on CNN?&#34;
He roasted the media for saying that the &#34;proof&#34; that President Biden &#34;hasn&#39;t lost it&#34; or &#34;riddled with dementia&#34; was by pointing to Russian President Vladimir Putin&#39;s comments calling the president &#34;smart.&#34;
CPAC DALLAS OPENS FRIDAY AS GOP, SQUARELY IN TRUMP&#39;S GRASP, LOOKS TO FUTURE
&#34;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m gonna go out on a limb here and say if it was Donald Trump that Vladimir Putin said that about, it&#39;d be a slightly different response,&#34; Trump Jr. told the crowd. &#34;Did you ever think that maybe Vlad is thrilled to be negotiating against a dolt? 
&#34;America First went down the toilet with this administration folks, okay? But despite what we&#39;re seen going on a daily basis, despite all of that … there&#39;s one silver lining, Michael Avenatti&#39;s going to prison!&#34; he grinned. &#34;I&#39;m sorry… ‘Democratic presidential hopeful.’ I heard this from Brian ‘Potato Head’ Stelter for years on CNN.&#34;
After exchanging pleasantries with an audience member, Trump Jr. shared why he thinks his family is loved by the conservative base.
&#34;We actually fight. We&#39;ll actually push back, right? That&#39;s what Donald Trump did for the Republican Party. He showed that you don&#39;t have to just turn the other cheek, roll over and die as the other side gets what they want and laughs their way to the bank,&#34; he explained. &#34;We need you guys in that fight with us… They can&#39;t cancel all of us.&#34; 
Trump Jr. slammed the &#34;propagandists&#34; in the media for &#34;jumping on every conspiracy.&#34;
&#34;Remember, you guys get canceled for being conspiracy theorists. They created them, they push them, and yet there&#39;s no accountability,&#34; he told the audience. &#34;But today, in 2021, we all know that the difference between a conspiracy theory and the truth is about six months.&#34;

Trump Jr. then took aim at White House chief medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, calling him a &#34;bureaucrat in a lab coat.&#34;
&#34;Fauci is better at pitching baseballs than he is at science, okay?&#34; Trump Jr. jabbed the NIAID director, a reference to Fauci&#39;s disastrous Opening Day first pitch attempt.
He pummeled Hunter Biden for his racist text messages that have surfaced from his &#34;laptop from Hell,&#34; as well as the newly-launched art show of his paintings, which has been sounding alarms over ethics concerns. 
&#34;How do we get what we want from the Democrat Party? Just buy Hunter&#39;s art,&#34; Trump Jr. knocked the president&#39;s son. &#34;What do you think the media reaction would be to &#39;Don Jr. smoking parmesan cheese?&#39; I promise you it wouldn&#39;t be what we saw from the media. It would be a little different. And then I say that and they say ‘Oh, you’re making fun of people with addiction&#39; … I totally understand addiction. It&#39;s terrible. We all know people that have suffered from it. It doesn&#39;t absolve you from being a total piece of garbage in every other aspect of your life. It doesn&#39;t absolve you from selling access to the highest levels of government. It doesn&#39;t absolve you from selling out your country. It doesn&#39;t absolve you from, I don&#39;t know, child support from the stripper you knocked up a couple of years ago… Because I have a feeling that if it was me, I would not be absolved.&#34;

Trump Jr. later railed against Hunter Biden&#39;s father and his love for ice cream. 
&#34;Has Joe Biden done anything that didn&#39;t involve an ice cream parlor?&#34; Trump Jr. asked. &#34;It&#39;s like a toddler. Like, ‘Joe, if you get the line right, you get a scoop of ice cream! Maybe even two scoops!’&#34;
He closed his remarks with a pep talk with the pro-Trump crowd. 
&#34;Stay in the fight. Stay in the game. Make sure you&#39;re involved. Make sure you have those conversations with your friends. Don&#39;t let this one slide,&#34; said Trump Jr. &#34;We need you in there with us… We will continue to be in this fight as long as you guys do.&#34;

Former HUD Secretary Dr. Ben Carson joins &#39;The Story&#39; to react to funding boost for hotels sheltering homeless
A 
Democratic
 candidate for mayor of 
New York City
 who has called for slashing the 
NYPD’s
 budget in half bragged Tuesday that nearly a third of her campaign’s donors are unemployed.

Residents have also been 
fleeing the city in droves
 amid the pandemic and due to rising crime, according to the New York Post. Roughly 300,000 households packed up and left between March and October 2020.
Morales has nevertheless called for cutting a whopping $3 billion from the city’s police department.

&#34;We know defunding the police doesn’t mean giving up on public safety; in fact, it means the opposite,&#34; her campaign wrote in an email seeking donations Tuesday night. &#34;Removing funding from an overly militarized, abusive agency founded on White supremacy and upheld by the status quo — and then investing in things like mental healthcare, housing, education, green spaces and public transit — makes us more safe, not less.&#34;
She has proposed a separate &#34;Community First Responders Department&#34; to respond to 911 calls about homelessness, mental health, substance abuse, emotional distress and other behavioral health issues – rather than the NYPD.

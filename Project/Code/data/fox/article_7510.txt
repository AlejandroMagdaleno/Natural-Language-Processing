The New York City Board of Elections released an update Wednesday evening, showing mayoral 
candidates
 Eric Adams neck-and-neck with Kathryn Garcia following the fallout over a significant 
tabulation error
.
The city’s rank-choice votes are largely in, with Adams edging ahead of Garcia by 51 percent to 49 percent of the votes, though there are another 124,000 absentee ballots still to be counted.
New York launched rank-choice voting this year – which relies on voters ranking their candidate preferences in order rather than selecting one candidate on the ballot. 
NYC MAYORAL PRIMARY IN CHAOS AFTER 135,000 PRE-ELECTION TEST BALLOTS COUNTED
The city’s mayoral race was the first major test in the new voting system, but the board’s Tuesday announcement that 135,000 pre-election test votes had been accidentally counted left some questioning the new system.

choice voting reporting error was unacceptable and we apologize to the voters and to the campaigns for the confusion,&#34; Commissioners of the Board of Elections said in a statement Wednesday.

AOC ENDORSES PROGRESSIVE MAYA WILEY IN NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL CONTEST
Mayoral candidate Maya Wiley, who was endorsed by New York Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, was &#34;eliminated&#34; from the race Wednesday, according to the board’s latest tally.
But Wiley maintains the race is far from over.
&#34;With more than 120,000 absentee ballots left to count - in addition to provisional ballots and potential recanvassing of results - this election is still wide open,&#34; she said in a statement.
Adams is currently leading the race over Garcia by more than 14,750 votes, an advantage not all that different from Tuesday’s tally that included the &#34;test ballots.&#34;

Garcia said she remains &#34;confident&#34; but is &#34;taking nothing for granted.&#34; She encouraged all candidates to patiently await the tally of the 124,000 absentee ballots.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, provides insight into the second Trump impeachment trial on ‘America’s Newsroom.’
Sen. 
Ted Cruz
, R-Texas, said Wednesday on 
&#34;America’s Newsroom&#34;
 that the second 
impeachment
 trial of former President Donald Trump is a &#34;mistake&#34; and &#34;doomed to failure.&#34;
The former president was impeached on Jan. 13, one week after violent pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol as Congress was certifying the results of President Biden’s victory in the 2020 election. The Senate will continue the impeachment trial proceedings this afternoon.

They have a new Democratic president, a Democratic House, a Democratic Senate, and instead of working on the very real problems we have in this country; we have tens of millions of Americans out of work, we have millions of kids who are not going to school, and yet the Democrats aren&#39;t trying to fix those problems. Instead, they want to go through a circus of an impeachment trial that they know is doomed to failure. I think it&#39;s a mistake but unfortunately, it&#39;s the path that the congressional Democrats have put us on.&#34;

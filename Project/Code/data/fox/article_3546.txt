Former Attorney General 
Eric Holder
, who is now the chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, advocated for disclosing donors to political organizations but said his group is not revealing its donors anytime soon during a 
congressional
 hearing on Thursday.
&#34;I do think that there needs to be transparency with regard to who is making donations to political organizations, and that would be good for our democracy,&#34; Holder told the House Administration Subcommittee on Elections during Wednesday&#39;s hearing.

&#34;Will you disclose the donors to the National Democratic Redistricting Committee for the record today?&#34; asked Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill., ranking member of the House Committee on Administration.
&#34;Well, what we do is follow the law as it exists. I&#39;m not going to unilaterally disarm. When Republicans will do the same thing, I will do that and we will certainly follow the law, but I stand for the disclosure obligations that are contained in the bills that are being considered before Congress,&#34; Holder responded.
Holder&#39;s group can be traced to megadonor Hansjorg Wyss. The National Democratic Redistricting Committee&#39;s 501(c)(4) arm, the National Redistricting Action Fund, received $3 million from a group connected to Wyss between 2018 and 2020.

The Wyss Foundation&#39;s Berger Action Fund provided 40% of the National Redistricting Action Fund&#39;s budget in 2017 and 2018 despite Holder&#39;s stated opposition to foreign dollars in U.S. 
politics
, the 
Washington Free Beacon
 reported.

As of 2014, Wyss 
said
 he did not hold American citizenship, although money from his 
Washington, D.C.
-based foundation appears to have 
trickled down
 into efforts to restore felons&#39; voting rights in 
Florida
, mandate automatic voter registration in 
Nevada
, redraw districts in 
Michigan
 and more.
Holder served as the U.S. attorney general from 2009 to 2015 under President

FOX News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins &#39;Your World&#39; with the latest and a look at what comes next
In a historic rebuke, the 
House of Representatives
 voted Wednesday to impeach 
President Trump
 for the second time for his role in last week&#39;s riots at the U.S. Capitol complex.
Trump is only president in history to be twice impeached. The House voted 232-197 to pass a resolution calling for Trump&#39;s impeachment on a single charge of &#34;incitement of insurrection.&#34; A total of 10 Republicans voted in favor of his impeachment.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell supports Democrats&#39; move to initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump and is &#34;done&#34; and &#34;furious&#34; with him, sources familiar told Fox News. However, the Senate is not expected to convene an impeachment trial prior to Jan. 19.

Fox News Sunday anchor Chris Wallace on President Biden using a script for first press conference.
&#34;Fox News Sunday&#34; host Chris Wallace told &#34;
America&#39;s Newsroom
&#34; on Friday that former President Ronald Reagan would have been &#34;roasted&#34; if he had been answering reporters&#39; questions with a 
script
 during the Cold War. Wallace&#39;s comment came after 
President Biden
 appeared to reference &#34;cheat sheets&#34; detailing key policy points and the identities of attending journalists when he conducted the first formal news conference of 
his presidency
 on Thursday.

CHRIS WALLACE
:
 I thought he did fine, but I was really surprised he had to read his answers on foreign policy. I&#39;ve never seen that before. 
...
It was striking. And as I say, I spent six years covering Reagan. 
I&#39;ve watched a lot of press conferences of other presidents since then. You know, I just think to myself, if somebody asked Ronald Reagan a question about Russia during the height of the Cold War and he said, well, wait a minute, and started looking at what my answer is about Gorbachev, we would have roasted him. 
It was surprising, yesterday.

Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, joins ‘America’s News HQ.’
Gina McCarthy, National Climate Adviser for 
President Biden
, said

 – a priority for the administration – is also a racial justice issue.

video
 addressing the intersectionality of climate change posted over the weekend, McCarthy explained that the issue &#34;exacerbates the challenges in the communities that have been left behind.&#34;
&#34;It goes after the very same communities that pollution has held back and racism has held back,&#34; McCarthy said. &#34;Climate justice is about equal rights.&#34;
The poorest and most vulnerable communities – or the ones that have not been invested in – tend to feel the effects of the climate crisis more than affluent areas.

For example, &#34;
cancer alley
&#34; – a stretch of industrial plants in Louisiana – is home to chemical plants and dangerous air pollution, as well as minority and poor communities.
These communities may also have fewer resources to deal with the effects of climate change – including owning items like air conditioners to cope with heat waves.
McCarthy added that promoting clean energy initiatives will also benefit U.S. economic growth by creating good-paying jobs, as well as union jobs.

Debt is expected to exceed output in the United States by 117% with the $6T budget plan. Insight from Rep. Lisa McClain.
A &#34;progress&#34; report put out on Instagram by the 
White House
 is touting the Biden administration’s &#34;successes&#34; on reducing COVID-19 cases and increasing vaccinations -- while not including other key issues, like re-opening schools where the administration has struggled.
&#34;We’ve turned the tide on a once-in-a-century crisis,&#34; the White House said in its Instagram post titled &#34;Progress Under 
President Biden
.&#34;
It highlighted a decrease in 
COVID-19 cases and death
, as well as fewer unemployment findings and less hunger. It also hailed an increase in vaccinations, jobs growth, &#34;people gaining health care coverage&#34; and &#34;small business confidence.&#34;
GOP SENATORS PROBE ‘CLOSE COORDINATION’ BETWEEN BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, TEACHERS UNIONS ON SCHOOL REOPENINGS
However, the White House chose not to include multiple other metrics, including the re-opening of schools. While schools have been open in many red states, many predominantly liberal areas where teachers unions hold significant political power have locked their school doors for most of the year.
Biden&#39;s administration pitched a low bar for success on the matter after he entered the White House -- with critics noting that a 100-day goal of 
50% of schools offering at least one day of in-person
 learning had mostly been met before Jan. 20. Biden later distanced himself from that metric.
LEGISLATORS ACCUSE SF SCHOOL DISTRICT OF USING LEGAL LOOPHOLE TO GET $12M IN REOPENING FUNDS
The Washington Post
 recently described Biden’s progress on getting schools open as &#34;uneven,&#34; despite a massive stimulus package including money purportedly for schools to re-open &#34;safely.&#34;
It cited research that found more than half of school districts in counties where former President Trump won were fully open in April, but where Biden won that number was just 25%.
Many commentators weren’t pleased with what they saw as an overly rosy picture of the state of America under Biden, noting that areas where Biden has struggled -- such as the crisis at the border, conflict in the Middle East, and rising gas prices -- were not mentioned in the graphic.

Sen. 
Ted Cruz
, R-Texas, endorsed 
Arizona
 governor candidate Matt Salmon for being a &#34;proven conservative&#34; on Wednesday.
&#34;I&#39;m proud to stand with my friend and proven conservative, Matt Salmon,&#34; Cruz sad in a statement. &#34;As governor, Matt will make the safety and security of all Arizonans his top priority. He will fight to protect Arizona from the Biden Administration&#39;s socialist policies. And Matt will continue the work, which started when he was in Congress, to defend Arizona from all threats, including those increasingly from foreign and state actors, while standing unapologetically on conservative principle. I ask fellow conservatives in Arizona to join me in supporting Matt&#39;s campaign for governor.&#34;
ARIZONA SECRETARY OF STATE KATIE HOBBS ANNOUNCES BID FOR GOVERNOR
Salmon has represented Arizona in two separate stints in C
ongress
, the first from 1995 to 2001 and the second from 2013 to 2017, according to 
Ballotpedia
. Salmon was the Republican nominee for Arizona 
governor
 in 2002 but lost to Democrat Janet Napolitano. He was lobbyist for Arizona State University before announcing his candidacy, according to the 
Arizona Mirror
.
&#34;Senator Cruz is a conservative stalwart who has always put America first. His pursuit of freedom and opportunity is only matched by his fidelity to the Constitution,&#34; Salmon said in a statement, &#34;I&#39;m honored and thankful for his endorsement.&#34;

FORMER REP. MATT SALMON ENTERS ARIZONA GUBERNATORIAL RACE WITH CLUB FOR GROWTH ENDORSEMENT
&#34;The other side isn&#39;t offering policies to make our lives better. They&#39;re offering conspiracies that only make our lives worse. We did our job. They refuse to do theirs. … That&#39;s why I&#39;m running for governor,&#34; Hobbs said in her 
launch video
.
&#34;In 2020, against all odds, in the middle of a pandemic, we proved that democracy works. It&#39;s been my job and life&#39;s work to make government work for the people of Arizona,&#34; she said.
The focus on Arizona&#39;s 2020 presidential election results raised Hobbs&#39; profile as she appeared on cable news to take issue with state Republicans.
&#34;We’ve got this state government being run by conspiracy theorists right now. They are out of touch with everyday Arizonans and that’s holding us back as a state,&#34; she told the 
Arizona Republic

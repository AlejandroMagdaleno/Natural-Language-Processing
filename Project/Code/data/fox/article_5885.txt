Florida congressman has publicly denied any wrongdoing
Reps. 
Matt Gaetz
, R-Fla., and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are teaming up for a joint rally tour across 
America
 this summer.
The Republican 
lawmakers
 revealed their plan to launch &#34;The America First Tour&#34; in a press release on Friday. The tour announcement comes as Gaetz faces a federal investigation into alleged sex crimes.
According to the release, the tour is set to kick off May 7 and aims to &#34;rally the 74 million Americans that voted for President Trump&#34; in the 2020 election, as well as highlight the &#34;destructive failings&#34; of 
President Biden
.
&#34;There are millions of Americans who need to know they still have advocates in Washington D.C., and the America First movement is consistently growing and fighting,&#34; Gaetz said.

&#34;These issues are bigger than any one election and we remain ready to take our party and our country back,&#34; Gaetz added.
Both members of Congress carry controversies with them.

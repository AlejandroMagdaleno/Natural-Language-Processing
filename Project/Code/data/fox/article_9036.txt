Cotton wouldn&#39;t say whether he plans to run for president in 2024.
Orlando, Florida -- Sen. Tom Cotton on Friday said that former President 
Donald Trump
 has a &#34;big role&#34; in the future of the 
Republican
 Party and warned that 
President Biden
 is trying to &#34;unravel&#34; Trump&#39;s accomplishments. 
Cotton, in an interview with Fox News, didn&#39;t say whether he plans to run for president in 2024, as many have speculated. He said that he instead aims to oppose Biden&#39;s actions as president and try to help flip Congress from red to blue in 2022. 
&#34;I&#39;ll focus on stopping Joe Biden&#39;s agenda and winning back the House and the Senate for now,&#34; Cotton said.

DONALD TRUMP JR. SLAMS &#39;BLINDLY&#39; SUPPORTING GOP INCUMBENTS, SAYS &#39;THERE&#39;S PLENTY&#39; OF GOP SENATORS TO PRIMARY
Cotton, in acknowledging that Trump still will play a major part in the GOP, said that one of his biggest contributions so far has been to move the GOP to more of a populist party. 
&#34;One thing that President Trump has done over the last five years is kind of reset the view of a lot of Republican politicians and help them understand the views of Republican voters,&#34; Cotton said. &#34;For most Americans, certainly most Republicans, it&#39;s just common sense that America should come first and that American workers should come first.&#34;
He added: &#34;He helped reset the Republican agenda. We now are putting Americans first. We&#39;re standing up to China. We are standing up for our trade interests to make sure that we&#39;re not just giving away our prosperity. And Joe Biden is trying to unravel all that. President Trump doesn&#39;t want it. I don&#39;t want it. And no Republican who aspires to leadership in the party should want it either.&#34;

Cotton, when asked about his place in the party, said &#34;my immediate role is trying to stop Joe Biden&#39;s open borders, big government, big tax, big-spending agenda.&#34;
But, Cotton added, the GOP has a serious opportunity to become more than a minority opposition party during the upcoming midterms.

&#34;We&#39;re much stronger coming out of the Trump presidency than we were out of either of the Bush presidencies,&#34; Cotton said. We&#39;ve got an evenly divided Senate and we have the biggest minority in the House of Representatives that we&#39;ve had in 80 years. So we have a lot of leverage to try to stop Joe Biden&#39;s agenda. And I think as we stop it and we expose it, it&#39;s going to become more and more unpopular... That&#39;s going to help us win back the House and the Senate next year.&#34;

Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., didn&#39;t mention governor during &#39;Brian Kilmeade Show&#39; interview on &#39;60 Minutes&#39; controversy
Sen. 
Rick Scott
, R-Fla., declined to defend his gubernatorial successor, Gov. 
Ron DeSantis
 on Fox News Radio&#39;s 
&#34;Brian Kilmeade Show&#34;
, amid a firestorm over the veracity of a 
&#34;60 Minutes&#34; segment
 painting the governor as closing a vaccination deal with Publix Supermarkets thanks in part to a $100,000 political donation.
Several 
Florida
 Democrats, including Palm Beach County Mayor Dave Kerner, ripped CBS News over the package, which aired Sunday evening and was noticeably absent from the network&#39;s news programming following the outcry.
West Palm Beach Mayor Keith James
, a Democrat who runs the county&#39;s largest city, however took the opposite tact, alleging &#34;there were no rules&#34; in DeSantis&#39; vaccine rollout and that &#34;those who had the fiscal resources were going to use them in whatever way they could to get this vaccine.&#34;
DeSantis claimed &#34;60 Minutes&#34; deceptively edited his remarks about Florida&#39;s coronavirus 
vaccine
 program, which Kerner had said was effective in his South Florida locale which is home to a large senior citizen population and where Publix is a ubiquity.
Kilmeade asked Scott about the firestorm, remarking that the long-running CBS newsmagazine hasn&#39;t covered potentially more egregious 
COVID
-related controversies involving Govs. 
Andrew M. Cuomo
 of New York and 
Gavin Newsom
 of California.
DESANTIS BLASTS CBS&#39; &#39;60 MINUTES&#39; FOR &#39;DECEPTIVELY-EDITED&#39; PUBLIX-COVID CLIP
&#34;From what you know, senator, as a former governor, was that a hit job?&#34; Kilmeade asked Scott.
Scott responded by praising Publix, telling Kilmeade the Lakeland-based grocer and executives are &#34;class acts.&#34;
&#34;I know everybody in Florida wants to get the vaccine as quickly as they can ...  they’re great company. I dont know how you could ever attack them.&#34;
Kilmeade then closed out the interview, adding that he sees the episode as a mainstream media attempt to &#34;take down&#34; DeSantis.
Notably, DeSantis recently criticized Scott in March, after the fiscally-conservative senator called on governors to refuse the &#34;wasteful&#34; federal taxpayer dollars being sent around to states as part of 
President Biden&#39;s
 massive COVID spending law.
&#34;[Scott&#39;s idea] doesn&#39;t make any sense,&#34; DeSantis said In March.

The governor argued that if Tallahassee were to refuse or send back the state&#39;s cut of the $1.9 trillion bill, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen would likely just shift the payment to a less-solvent Democratic-run state like New Jersey or Illinois.
&#34;I don’t think that would make sense for Floridians to be giving even more money to the blue states that already getting such a big windfall,&#34; he said at the time.
The two Sunshine State Republicans are seen as potential 2024 presidential primary contenders.

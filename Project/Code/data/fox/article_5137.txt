Former Secretary of 
Education
 Dr. Bill Bennett said Monday &#34;it is a scandal&#34; for many major public 
schools
 in the U.S. to continue to be shut down under President 
Biden’s
 administration.
&#34;It’s true now that a lot of kids may not see classrooms until September,&#34; Bennett said during an appearance on 
&#34;America’s Newsroom.&#34;
 &#34;This is a catastrophe for these kids, and there’s no beating around the bush on this.&#34;
The White House has said more funding is required to reopen schools safely and pushed for Biden&#39;s $1.9 trillion COVID relief package to be passed in Congress.
Bennett asserted that the U.S. could have a &#34;lost generation&#34; of children who will suffer academically, socially, and morally if a plan to return them to the classroom is not created soon.
Biden 
has called
 for most schools to reopen within his first 100 days in office.

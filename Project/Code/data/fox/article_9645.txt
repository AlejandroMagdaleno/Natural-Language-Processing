Sgt. Darren Moss Jr., with the Pierce County Sheriff&#39;s Department, explains why an officer with his department called off a K9 search for a murder suspect given the new police reform law. 
Sgt. Darren Moss Jr., with the Pierce County Sheriff&#39;s Department in 
Washington
 state, told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends Weekend
&#34; on Sunday that 
officers
 have been &#34;unclear on whether they’re going to be OK to use force&#34; in certain situations given the new police reform law, which went into effect last week, and have been advised to take a &#34;conservative approach&#34; in those cases.
Moss made the comments four days after deputies with his department, who were investigating a murder case in Washington, 
decided not to use a K9 dog
 in their search for a suspect after taking the new reform laws into consideration. 
The Pierce County Sheriff’s Department said it responded to 911 calls reporting shots being fired at a Kohl’s store in Puyallup on Wednesday night and when &#34;deputies arrived on scene they found a young male deceased in the north side of the parking lot.&#34; 
&#34;Several people reported seeing a male in a black shirt and black pants running from the shooting and deputies checked the area to see if they could locate anyone matching the description,&#34; the department 
said in a statement
. &#34;A K9 officer was on scene within minutes, but because probable cause had not been developed for a particular individual, they decided not to track for the possible suspect since they could not use force to detain him.&#34;
House Bill 1310, which went into effect in Washington state last weekend, indicates that police now need probable cause before using force, according to 
KING5
.  
Moss explained on Sunday that because of the new law, &#34;the officer felt he didn&#39;t have enough probable cause to use force in this situation so instead of searching with the K9, he decided to just search without him.&#34; 
Moss told host 
Pete Hegseth
 that the officer made the decision because he was &#34;scared&#34; the K9 dog could &#34;bite the suspect without probable cause,&#34; and therefore, &#34;he would be in violation of the law.&#34;
He went on to explain the &#34;bigger changes&#34; that arose due to the new law.  
&#34;They moved from us being able to use reasonable suspicion to pursue vehicles or to use force in a situation where we found someone we suspected of a crime and they upped that to probable cause, which just requires a little bit more evidence, which is what we use to make an arrest, but not to detain someone,&#34; Moss told Hegseth. 
&#34;So in these situations, officers are somewhat unclear on whether they&#39;re going to be OK to use force.&#34; 
NEW RESTRICTIONS ON WASHINGTON STATE POLICE MAY LEAD TO SPIKE IN CRIME
 
He went on to say that &#34;in those instances where they&#39;re not sure, we’ve advised them to just take the conservative approach and not use force if they can avoid it.&#34;
KING5 reports that Rep. Roger Goodman, a Democrat, is one of the bill’s supporters. 
&#34;From the majority of agencies typically in my area in Central Puget Sound, they say we understand the legislature&#39;s intent, we agree with the intent to use this force to have more equitable treatment of people in the community,&#34; he told the station. 
&#34;Police should be responding to calls, they should show up. The rules of engagement may change a little bit when they do show up,&#34; he added. &#34;Because we want to focus on de-escalation and less use of force.&#34; 
The police debate has been at the top of the American conscience since a White, now-former police officer in Minneapolis, Derek Chauvin, knelt on the neck of 
George Floyd
 for more than nine minutes in May 2020; Floyd later died. 
Chauvin has since been 
convicted of murder
, but Floyd&#39;s death sparked 
nationwide protests
 and ignited the &#34;defund the police&#34; movement.
Moss said that his department tried to adjust to the new police reform law in the state, noting that his agency provided &#34;a little bit of training&#34; for deputies prior to the law going into effect and will have a little more starting next week. 
&#34;The state academy did not have any training available for the agencies until about the week of the changes going into effect so a lot of agencies were scrambling to get their policies in check and make sure officers had a little bit of training,&#34; Moss noted.

He added that his department is &#34;still trying to figure out what exactly … some of the things that haven&#39;t been defined in the law&#34; mean, noting that the agency is &#34;trying to work through&#34; that.

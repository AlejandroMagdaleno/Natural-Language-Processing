One of the aides for 
Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.
, serves on a diversity council that has promoted 
critical race theory (CRT)
 in education.
The Washington Free Beacon 
reported
 on Monday that the Livingston Diversity Council, where Slotkin aide Mona Shand is board member at large, defends the controversial concept on its website.
Under the &#34;critical race theory&#34; section, the website directs readers to an article titled &#34;Advocate for Critical Race Theory in Education.&#34; &#34;What can we, here in Livingston County, Michigan, do?&#34; it asks before linking to the article by author Nicole Cardoza.
It also links to a Facebook post that acknowledges similarities with so-called &#34;anti-racist&#34; education and other programs but argues those aren&#39;t CRT in themselves. The embedded infographic goes on to warn about anti-CRT legislation.

&#34;Today CRT is taught mostly at the higher education level. However, there is a growing consensus amongst educators that it should be taught at earlier levels,&#34; it reads. &#34;Unfortunately, lawmakers in at least 15 states have recently introduced and have already passed bills … that seek to prevent teachers from using CRT and other anti-racism resources that discuss racism and social justice in school curriculums.&#34;
Slotkin&#39;s office did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment. The Livingston Diversity Council said in a statement to Fox News: &#34;The Livingston Diversity Council (LDC) is a change agent for diversity, equity, inclusion, and access that collaborates, educates and empowers to build a thriving community.  At this time, the LDC is not advocating for Critical Race Theory, we are only providing educational resources on the topic to empower folks to be informed on issues that may impact them.&#34;  
&#34;All of our Directors are committed to service of the LDC because of their compassion and personal commitment to advancing diversity, equity, inclusion and access in Livingston County. Some of our directors serve in their private capacity and some are employed by business partners of the LDC, and are designated as such on our business member page.&#34;
Slotkin currently serves in the swing state of Michigan with Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., who previously caught backlash for her answer in response to a CRT-related question.

      Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., has an aide who serves on a diversity council that has promoted critical race theory.
      
Footage obtained by Fox News showed Stevens being asked about CRT during a June 10 town hall in Northville, Michigan. She responded: &#34;As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, what I want to do is continue to support our schools to be able to educate the next generation.&#34;
At that point, people started talking over her and a man seemed to ask for her position on CRT. She eventually told the crowd that she didn&#39;t think CRT was a congressional issue. &#34;I personally don&#39;t think this is a congressional issue … so I am not taking a position on that,&#34; she said.

&#34;What a coward!&#34; shouted a male voice. &#34;You&#39;re a coward.&#34; Stevens seemed to smile in response. 
Stevens&#39; communications director, Larkin Parker, told Fox News: &#34;The congresswoman absolutely did take a stance, school curriculums are not a congressional issue. It is up to the local school boards to make these choices.&#34;

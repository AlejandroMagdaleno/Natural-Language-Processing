The rule was scheduled to go into effect on Friday but has since been delayed until March 22.
On Wednesday, White House chief of staff Ron Klain directed agencies to pause orders signed towards the end of Trump’s term so they could be reviewed.
The order directs the administration to immediately withdraw rules that have been sent to the Office of Financial Research but not yet published in the Federal Register. For those that have been published, but are not yet effective, members are directed to &#34;consider postponing the rules&#39; effective dates for 60 days.&#34;

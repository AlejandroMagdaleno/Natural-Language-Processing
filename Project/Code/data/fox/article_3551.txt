Emotions running high over Trump 
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., on Sunday suggested that God is a woman while discussing the 
impeachment
 trial against former 
President Donald Trump
. 
Swalwell, 40, made the comments during an appearance on 
MSNBC
, explaining Democrats’ decision 
not to subpoena
 additional witnesses. 
&#34;The choice was, do we chase those people – not knowing what they’re going to say to the courts – for years. Or do we go forward with a powerful, thundering case that we have,&#34; Swalwell said. &#34;And also, (Senate Minority Leader) 
Mitch McConnell
 was already telling us that he believed the challenge was a jurisdictional one.&#34;

Swalwell said calling witnesses wouldn’t have changed Republicans&#39; mind on voting to acquit Trump on the charge of citing Jan. 6’s riot at the U.S. Capitol, even if the witnesses were &#34;God herself.&#34; 
Swalwell served as the House impeachment manager, trying to convince at least two-thirds of the Senate to convict Trump. His role in that capacity raised some eyebrows from a few Republicans, given allegations that Swalwell consorted with a 
suspected Chinese spy
.
Axios 
reported last year
 that a Chinese national named Fang Fang, or Christine Fang, targeted up-and-coming local politicians, including Swalwell, who she reportedly met when he was a councilman before he was elected to Congress.

Fang reportedly took part in fundraising for Swalwell&#39;s 2014 reelection campaign, although she did not make donations nor was there evidence of illegal contributions. 
Sen. Rand Paul and other prominent Republicans scoffed at Swalwell’s role in the impeachment proceedings.

&#34;That’s an interesting choice...somebody who&#39;s part of a Chinese espionage ring effectively, so it&#39;s a provocative choice,&#34; Sen. Josh Hawley, told a pool reporter during a break in the proceedings about Swalwell’s selection as an impeachment manager.

Israel Defense Forces international spokesman Jonathan Conricus argues that none of the violence over the past two weeks &#39;would have been possible without Iranian knowledge, funding, expertise and hands on involvement on the ground.&#39; 
Secretary of State
 Antony Blinken stressed the 
Biden
 administration’s focus on an &#34;equal peace&#34; between 
Israel
 and the 
Palestinian people
 after the most recent bloody 
conflict
 in the region. 
The two nations agreed to an unconditional cease-fire following 11 days of fighting that led to intense international scrutiny and criticism of the response by Israel.

Blinken said a big part of that process would be to ensure that the Palestinian people feel &#34;equal measures of security, of peace and of dignity.&#34;

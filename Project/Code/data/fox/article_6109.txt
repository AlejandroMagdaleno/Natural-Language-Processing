MediaBuzz host previews how the media will cover the upcoming trial on ‘America Reports.’
Fox News media analyst 
Howard Kurtz
 predicts former President 
Donald Trump’s
 second 
impeachment
 trial will be &#34;grand political theater&#34; that will dominate media coverage.
&#34;I think much of the media will use this trial, knowing the math, to try to convict Donald Trump in the court of public opinion,&#34; Kurtz said Monday on &#34;
America Reports
.&#34; 
WHY THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT FIZZLED AND ACQUITTAL IS NOW A FOREGONE CONCLUSION
Trump’s second impeachment trial 
formally began Jan. 25
, when senators were sworn in as jurors, and is set to resume Feb. 9. The former president is charged with incitement of insurrection related to the Jan. 6 
riot on Capitol Hill
. 
Last week, 45 Republican senators 
voted that the trial is unconstitutional
 because Trump has already left office. The Senate would need a 67-vote majority in order to convict the former president.
FORTY-FIVE REPUBLICANS VOTE AGAINST PROCEEDING WITH SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
In a 
recent Fox News article
, Kurtz wrote that the impeachment efforts are &#34;essentially toast&#34; and that acquittal is &#34;a foregone conclusion.&#34;
&#34;Any flickering hope among Democrats to convict private citizen Donald Trump died when 45 of the 50 Senate Republicans voted that the entire proceeding is unconstitutional,&#34; Kurtz wrote.
Though he believes the outcome is already known, Kurtz told &#34;America Reports&#34; that media interest in the trial will remain high. 
&#34;It will be grand political theater where we all know what happens in the last act,&#34; the 
MediaBuzz
 host told 
John Roberts
. &#34;It will get saturation coverage because the media are going through withdrawal over the Trump show, which always delivers clicks and ratings.&#34;
In addition, Kurtz said, media outlets will consider the trial newsworthy because it relates to the Capitol Hill riot. 
&#34;A trial that stems from the awful violence and ransacking of the Capitol is a genuinely important story, regardless of outcome,&#34; he said.

Though Trump has left office, Kurtz believes he will continue to generate media coverage.
&#34;Just as [President] Joe Biden is trying to focus on the opening act of his administration, the Trump show will be back,&#34; Kurtz said. &#34;And there’s just no question it’s going to be on every screen.&#34;

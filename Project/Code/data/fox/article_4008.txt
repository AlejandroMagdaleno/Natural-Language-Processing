The Fox Nation host says the California governor&#39;s remarks were &#39;incredibly insulting&#39; and will have &#39;unintended consequences.&#39;
California
 Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
 accused his critics of &#34;weaponizing&#34; his son, who caught attention for not wearing a mask while indoors at a summer camp.
Fox News reported earlier this week that Newsom pulled his son out of the camp after photos of him surfaced.
Addressing the backlash, Newsom said: &#34;You want to come after me, come after me but don&#39;t come after 9 and 10 year olds.&#34;
Newsom claimed that his son was at the camp for one day and took off his mask for a picture.

&#34;They&#39;re attacking and weaponizing my son,&#34; he added. &#34;I watched the network news last night and they&#39;re weaponizing my son, who was sitting there with me crying last night. You want to come after me, come after me. He did nothing wrong.&#34;

&#34;We’re going to start with a requirement K through 12 that the year begins with masks,&#34; California Health and Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly said at the time. &#34;At the outset of the new year, students should be able to walk into school without worrying about whether they will feel different or singled out for being vaccinated or unvaccinated – treating all kids the same will support a calm and supportive school environment.&#34;

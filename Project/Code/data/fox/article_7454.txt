White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on Biden speaking out against Border Patrol agents on &#39;Special Report.&#39;
White 
House
 press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday knocked &#34;
Republicans
 who are standing at the border and giving speeches,&#34; though President Biden has yet to travel to the southern 
border
 amid the ongoing crisis.
&#34;For all of those Republicans who are standing at the border and giving speeches about how broken the system is, Why don’t you join us and be a part of the solution instead of relying on speeches,&#34; Psaki said to reporters during the White House press briefing.
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS REMOVED JUST 2K OF 30,000 MIGRANTS WHO SURGED BORDER IN DEL RIO
&#34;Because we can work together and get immigration reform passed and make the system work,&#34; Psaki continued.
Texas Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson responded to Psaki&#39;s comments in a Monday email to Fox News, offering a &#34;solution&#34; of his own to the mounting border crisis.
&#34;Here’s a solution: finish building the wall, fully reimplement the Remain in Mexico policy, and stop undermining our brave border patrol officers at every turn,&#34; Jackson said. &#34;President Trump’s successful approach to immigration gave us the most secure border in history, and Joe Biden started undoing that success on day one.&#34;
&#34;We don’t have to stand around and wonder what, or rather who, created this crisis,&#34; Jackson added. &#34;Joe Biden did this all on his own and is now refusing to carry out the obvious solutions.&#34;
Biden has yet to visit the border during his time in office. In fact, it&#39;s unclear whether the president has 
ever visited the border
 during his decades-long political career. 
BORDER PATROL STUNNED AS BIDEN GOES TO WAR WITH HIS OWN AGENTS OVER FALSE ‘WHIPPING’ ALLEGATIONS
 
Psaki on Monday also stood by the White House&#39;s criticisms last week of mounted border agents dealing with the crisis in Del Rio, Texas. Biden previously claimed that the agents had &#34;strapped&#34; migrants, echoing claims from Democrats that migrants were &#34;whipped,&#34; but that claim 
has since been debunked
. 
Psaki was asked whether the administration&#39;s position on the agents has changed in light of the debunked &#34;whipping&#34; claims.

&#34;I don&#39;t think anyone could look at those photos and think that was appropriate action or behavior or something that should be accepted within our administration,&#34; Psaki said. 
&#34;Our reaction to the photos has not changed,&#34; she added.

Reports of smugglers telling illegal aliens crossing into New Mexico to use Uber and Lyft transportation. Sunland Park Mayor Javier Perea joins &#39;Fox &amp; Friends First&#39; with reaction.
Republican members of the House Oversight Committee are demanding a field hearing in New Mexico to examine the impact of the 
border crisis
 in the state.
&#34;Every single GOP member of the House Oversight Committee has signed on to my letter calling for a field hearing on the New Mexico border to address the Biden Border Crisis,&#34; announced New Mexico Rep. Yvette Herrell on Twitter. &#34;By end of FY2021, a population the size of New Mexico will have illegally entered the US.&#34;
The letter argues that it is the Oversight Committee&#39;s &#34;duty&#34; to &#34;provide oversight of the crises that face our country,&#34; specifically pointing to the how the border crisis could potentially exacerbate the 
COVID-19
 pandemic.
AZ ATTORNEY GENERAL SCOLDS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FOR RELEASING COVID-POSITIVE MIGRANTS
&#34;We are unable to properly determine the infection status of those that have entered illegally and have been apprehended, let alone those those that have escaped,&#34; the letter reads. &#34;What we do know is that a recent report indicates a 900 percent increase in the COVID-19 positive testing rate for illegal immigrants in custody in the Rio Grand Valley Sector for the first two weeks of July.&#34;
The letter – which GOP Reps. James Comer, Clay Higgins, Andrew S. Clyde, Glenn Grothmam, and Byron Donalds signed – argues the U.S. is &#34;on pace to have nearly 2 million people cross the border by the end of this fiscal year, the approximate size of New Mexico&#39;s population.&#34;
The lawmakers call on testimony from 
Dr. Anthony Fauci
, as well as Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and National Institutes of Health Director Francis S. Collins.

&#34;Additionally, we ask that his hearing be a field hearing held in New Mexico near the southern border,&#34; the letter concludes. &#34;This will give some of the medical professionals their first exposure to the porous border with Mexico and help them better understand the threat of viral spread occurring.&#34;

Texas 
GOP Chairman 
Allen West 
announced his resignation Friday as he considers a run for elected office, according to reports. 
&#34;It has been my distinct honor to serve as Chairman of the Republican Party of Texas. I pray Godspeed for this governing body,&#34; he said in a release, according to FOX 7 in Austin.
He joked he might run for &#34;dog catcher&#34; before telling reporters he was looking at a statewide office or even a congressional run. 
&#34;There’s a guy in Texas 32 I really don&#39;t care for being my congressional representative,&#34; he said, referring to U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat.

West took over the top position less than a year ago, according to the
 Texas Tribune

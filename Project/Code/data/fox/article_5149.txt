&#39;The Five&#39; reacts to former White House ethics chief&#39;s response to the first son&#39;s latest business venture
President Biden’s
 
sister appears to be cashing in on her brother&#39;s ascension to office with a new book about her relationship with the president.
It was announced on Thursday that Biden’s sister, Valerie Biden Owens, will be publishing a memoir next April entitled &#34;Growing Up Biden: A Memoir,&#34; which will look at her life growing up with the president.

Politico
 
reported Thursday.
In his 2007 memoir, Biden said his sister became his &#34;best friend&#34; by the time Owens was 6 years old and has been a central figure in his political career — managing each of his campaigns until his 2020 presidential run, the outlet noted. 
&#34;Valerie Biden was the cornerstone that allowed me to sustain and then rebuild my family,&#34; Biden wrote in 2007. &#34;When Neilia died, my sister was the person I trusted completely with my sons.&#34;
Owens&#39; memoir appears to go against White House policy. Press secretary Jen Psaki 
said
 in January that it was the administration’s policy &#34;that the president&#39;s name should not be used in connection with any commercial activities to suggest or in any way, in any way they could reasonably be understood to imply his endorsement or support.&#34;

.
Neither the White House nor Celadon Books, Owens’ publisher, responded to Fox News’ requests for comment.

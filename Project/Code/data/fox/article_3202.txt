Over the past several weeks, prominent 
Democrats
 in Washington have claimed that items ranging from 
caregiving
, to 
climate action
, to the 
Everglades ecosystem in South Florida
 are all examples of infrastructure.
President Biden
 said at a recent press conference that computer chips are infrastructure, telling reporters &#34;chips, like the one I have here -- these chips, these wafers, are batteries, broadband; it&#39;s all infrastructure. This is infrastructure.&#34;
Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., proclaimed on Twitter last week that &#34;
climate action is infrastructure
,&#34; arguing in a 
Washington Post op-ed
 that &#34;a true infrastructure plan&#34; will deliver &#34;climate justice&#34; and should include key elements of the Green New Deal.
And Rep. Marilyn Strickland, D-Wash., said three days ago that &#34;
affordable housing is infrastructure
&#34; as she announced a new piece of legislation that would &#34;make smart, effective, and green housing infrastructure investments&#34; around the country.
Their colleagues in state politics are going further. Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, the second most senior state Democrat in Wisconsin, said &#34;
police accountability is infrastructure
&#34; on Thursday as he calls for policing reform.
Some Democrats have even joked about how far their party is stretching the limits of the term. The newly elected Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y.,  tweeted on Wednesday that &#34;
Supreme Court expansion is infrastructure
,&#34; a tongue-in-cheek reference to his plan to add four new members to the Supreme Court.
The statements come during the White House’s sales pitch for the American Jobs Plan, a $2.25 trillion bill that Biden says is a &#34;blueprint for infrastructure needed for tomorrow.&#34;
It would be the second piece of signature legislation for the Biden administration after the
 
American Rescue Plan. That COVID-19 recovery bill contained unrelated spending provisions, such as $100 million for a 
Silicon Valley railway project
 and $1.5 million for a 
bridge between the U.S. and Canada favored by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand first 
raised eyebrows about the definition of &#34;infrastructure&#34; in early April
 when she said, &#34;Paid leave is infrastructure. Child care is infrastructure. Caregiving is infrastructure.&#34;
She told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto
 last week that &#34;we define… infrastructure as what’s necessary to get the economy moving. And if you don’t have access to day care, universal pre-K, affordable day care, or a national paid leave plan, it’s going to be really hard to get families back to work.&#34;
Meanwhile, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell 
told reporters last month
 that Biden’s bill is &#34;like a Trojan horse… it’s called infrastructure, but inside the Trojan horse it’s going to be more borrowed money and massive tax increases on all the productive parts of our economy.&#34;
The New Oxford American Dictionary defines infrastructure as &#34;the basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads, power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.&#34;

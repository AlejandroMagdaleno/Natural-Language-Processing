Virginia
 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe on Sunday repeated his talking point about critical race theory being a &#34;dog whistle&#34; and said it is a &#34;made-up&#34; plan by his Republican opponent to &#34;divide people.&#34;
McAuliffe made the comments during an interview on CNN&#39;s &#34;State of the Union&#34; in response to a question about how he would respond to a former supporter of his who is 
now supporting 
Glenn Youngkin, his Republican opponent, over public schools &#34;pushing a radical agenda in which American history is portrayed as racist.&#34;
&#34;This is a made-up – This is a Trump, Betsy DeVos, Glenn Youngkin plan to divide people,&#34; McAuliffe said. &#34;It really bothers me. I try to unite people.&#34;
&#34;I really hate to see what Glenn Youngkin is trying to do to Virginia what Donald Trump did to our country,&#34; McAuliffe added. &#34; I really hate to see the division, the hatred. We&#39;re putting these children in this horrible position. Let&#39;s just be clear. We don&#39;t teach critical race theory.&#34;
MCAULIFFE GRILLED TO DEFINE CRITICAL RACE THEORY AFTER SAYING IT &#39;DOESN&#39;T EXIST&#39; IN VA, CALLS IT &#39;DOG WHISTLE&#39;
This isn&#39;t the first time that McAuliffe has attempted to dismiss critical race theory concerns. Earlier this summer, Fox News 
reported
 that McAuliffe said at a campaign event that critical race theory was a &#34;right-wing conspiracy.&#34;
&#34;That&#39;s another right-wing conspiracy,&#34; he said. &#34;This is totally made up by Donald Trump and Glenn Youngkin. This is who they are. It&#39;s a conspiracy theory.&#34;
As recent as this past week, McAuliffe was grilled on critical race theory during a roundtable discussion with WAVY News, where he 
claimed
, &#34;It&#39;s never been taught in Virginia.&#34;
&#34;It&#39;s not taught in Virginia and it&#39;s never been taught in Virginia,&#34; McAuliffe said. &#34;And as I&#39;ve said this a lot, it&#39;s a dog whistle. It&#39;s racial, it&#39;s division and it&#39;s used by Glenn Youngkin and others, it&#39;s the same thing with Trump and the border wall, to divide people. We should not be dividing people in school.&#34;

When McAuliffe was asked how he would define critical race theory, he dismissed the question and said, &#34;It doesn&#39;t matter.&#34;
&#34;It doesn&#39;t matter,&#34; McAuliffe said. &#34;It&#39;s not taught here in Virginia so I&#39;m not going to spend my time – I&#39;m not even spending my time because the school board and everyone else has come out and said it&#39;s not taught. It&#39;s racist. It&#39;s a dog whistle.&#34;

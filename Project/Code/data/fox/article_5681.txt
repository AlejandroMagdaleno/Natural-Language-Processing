Rep. Jim Jordan tells 
President Trump&#39;s support among Republican voters remains strong despite the criticism he has faced in the media and from lawmakers following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
Only 8% of Republican voters support the second 
impeachment
 of 
President Trump
 and his removal from office, a new national poll indicates.
That stands in stark contrast to the 89% of Democrats and 45% of independents questioned in a 
NBC News poll
 released Thursday who support impeaching and ousting the president for allegedly encouraging the 
storming of the Capitol
 to protest lawmakers&#39; certification of 
President-elect Joe Biden
’s 
Electoral College
 victory over Trump.
The poll was conducted Jan. 10-13, mostly before and slightly after Wednesday’s 232-197 vote by the House of Representatives to impeach Trump for &#34;incitement of insurrection.&#34; Ten Republicans voted to impeach the president – joining all 222 Democrats -- with 197 House Republicans voting against impeachment, and four GOP lawmakers not voting.

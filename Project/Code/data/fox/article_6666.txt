Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-
N.J.
, said Tuesday that she witnessed some lawmakers leading people through the Capitol the day before the riot in what looked like a &#34;reconnaissance&#34; tour, and said members will be held accountable.
Sherrill made her comments during a roughly 13-minute video on Facebook, where she addressed her constituents about the steps that Congress will take to hold President Trump and &#34;those responsible&#34; accountable for allegedly inciting the riot. 
&#34;I also intend to see that those members of Congress who abetted him, those members of Congress who had groups coming through the capitol that I saw on Jan. 5 for reconnaissance for the next day. Those members of Congress who incited the violent crowd. Those members of Congress that attempted to help our president undermine our democracy, I&#39;m going see that they&#39;re held accountable,&#34; Sherrill 
said
.
She told Fox News on Wednesday: &#34;We&#39;re requesting an investigation right now with certain agencies,&#34; without elaborating.

The congresswoman didn&#39;t name any of the lawmakers, or offer additional details into what qualified their actions to be &#34;reconnaissance.&#34; It&#39;s not clear how she determined that the &#34;reconnaissance&#34; was connected to the riots the following day, according to Politico. 
Sherrill also discussed why she voted for a resolution urging Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. 
The measure passed late Tuesday (223-205) and was seen as symbolic because Pence has already said he would not take the action. The House is expected to vote to impeach the president Wednesday.
Sherrill also detailed her account of what occurred on Jan 6, when Pro-Trump protesters stormed the Capitol, which sent Congress into recess and the Capitol building into lockdown -- as members attempted to certify the results of the presidential election in favor of President-elect Joe Biden.

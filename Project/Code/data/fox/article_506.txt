Tim Scott responds to MSNBC’s Joy Reid&#39;s comments calling the senator a ‘prop’
National Democrats rushed to Twitter on Wednesday to blame &#34;White supremacy&#34; and &#34;racism&#34; for the mass shooting spree that targeted massage parlors in the 
Atlanta
 area, but police officials say the suspect claimed the deadly shootings were not racially motivated.
Robert Aaron Long
, the 21-year-old who authorities said took &#34;responsibility&#34; for the string of shootings Tuesday that left eight people dead, 
reportedly
 confessed that he has a &#34;sex addiction&#34; and that he viewed the massage parlors as &#34;an outlet for him&#34; where he could be tempted.
WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT ATLANTA SHOOTING SUSPECT ROBERT LONG
&#34;He apparently has an issue, what he considers a sex addiction, and sees these locations as ... a temptation for him that he wanted to eliminate,&#34; said Cherokee County Sheriff&#39;s Office Capt. Jay Baker during a press conference. 
Long&#39;s reported motive for the shooting appears to contradict several national Democrats in Congress, including Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who quickly blamed &#34;white supremacy&#34; while the investigation was still ongoing. Two of the fatalities were White, while the other six victims were Asian Americans, according to police.
&#34;Imagine if he was Black, Muslim or Latino,&#34; Tlaib tweeted. &#34;This is exposing white supremacy in all forms.&#34;
Democratic Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., blamed &#34;White supremacy&#34; and &#34;racist rhetoric centered around COVID-19&#34; in a since-deleted Twitter thread reacting to the shootings. 
&#34;Although more information is still needed, it&#39;s clear that the epidemic of gun violence, anti-Asian sentiment, and white supremacy have been neglected for too long and pose a grave risk to our country,&#34; Smith 
wrote

ATLANTA MAYOR SPEAKS OUT AFTER MASS SHOOTING
 
He 
added
: &#34;These attacks come at a time when white supremacy and anti-Asian violence are spreading like a disease in our country. This is a direct result of the racist rhetoric centered around COVID-19 – even used by other elected officials – which directly led us to where we are today.&#34;
Former Democratic President Barack Obama also weighed in on the shooting, tweeting that the &#34;Identity of the victims underscores an alarming rise in anti-Asian violence.&#34;
He then continued his tweet thread by talking about the importance of &#34;commonsense gun safety laws,&#34; despite the shooting investigation being ongoing. 
According to a press release, Long has been charged with at least four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. He will be arraigned on Thursday morning.

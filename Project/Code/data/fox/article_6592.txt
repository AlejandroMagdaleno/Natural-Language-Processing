The 
California
-based 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
 on Friday ruled against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 
coronavirus
 mandates that barred private 
school
 children from receiving in-person teaching. 
In a suit brought forward in July 2020 by the Center for American Liberty, 20 plaintiffs challenged an order by 
Newsom
 that barred in-person teaching in 32 counties – a mandate that affected 80% of California’s children.
Five of the plaintiffs argued that Newsom overstepped his authority in denying private-school parents control over their children’s education.

&#34;California’s forced closure of their private schools implicates a right that has long been considered fundamental under the applicable caselaw — the right of parents to control their children’s education and to choose their children’s educational forum,&#34; Judge Daniel Collins said Friday. 
The federal appellate court remanded the case for further proceedings and said it was not &#34;moot.&#34;
The court did rule against 14 parents and one student who challenged a previous district court ruling and said the parental rights regarding education in private schools did not hold for public school parents.
&#34;We hold that the district court properly rejected the substantive due process claims of those Plaintiffs who challenge California’s decision to temporarily provide public education in an almost exclusively online format,&#34; Collins said.

The Ninth Circuit judge argued that both the U.S. Supreme Court and the California court have yet to &#34;recognize a federal constitutional right&#34; to have the state &#34;affirmatively&#34; provide education in a specific format, meaning public education could still be taught in-person or online. 
Harmeet Dhillion, founder of the Center for American Liberty, said the group would continue to challenge Newsom’s order as it pertains to public schools.

...
So what are they doing at the Biden administration? They&#39;re laughing because they don&#39;t care what the narratives are here in the United States of America. What they&#39;re looking at is: How do you devalue the American dollar? And they&#39;re working on it every day. And the socialist Democrats in this town are helping them every day...

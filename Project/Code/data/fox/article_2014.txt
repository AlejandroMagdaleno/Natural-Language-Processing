Rosendo Hinojosa, a retired Border Patrol agent, says it&#39;s &#39;hard to believe&#39; Biden officials don&#39;t know how many migrants have been released into the country because every migrant apprehension and release is documented.
Border Patrol agents
 in Texas arrested a number of criminal illegal immigrants coming into the U.S. in the last week, including sex offenders with prior convictions and an MS-13 gang member.
In a statement, Customs and Border Protection outlined how Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley Sector apprehended eight migrants crossing the border -- including a Guatemalan who was arrested, and later convicted of sexual abuse in 2009.

A few days later, agents in Welasco apprehended a Mexican national who had previously been convicted of sex offenses in California, and sentenced to 38 months in jail. California is a sanctuary state and limits cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE.)
Meanwhile, on Saturday, agent near Sarita arrested an illegal immigrant at a checkpoint -- it turned out that he had previously been arrested and convicted for indecent liberties with a child in North Carolina, for which he served 125 months in prison.
That arrest occurred on the same day as border agents in McAllen apprehended four migrants near Hidalgo -- which included a 28-year-old MS-13 gang member. That arrest was followed by the arrest of a Gulf Cartel gang member a day later near Progresso.

MS-13, also called Mara Salvatrucha, was set up in Los Angeles by Central American immigrants and has expanded across the continent -- particularly in Northern Triangle countries like El Salvador and Guatemala. It is known for its particularly horrific and gruesome crimes, and its motto is 
said to be
 &#34;mata, viola, controla&#34; -- which means &#34;kill, rape, control.&#34;

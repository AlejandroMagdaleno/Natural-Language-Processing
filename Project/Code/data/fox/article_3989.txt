California radio host Mike Slater on Gov, Gavin Newsom suggesting he is getting criticized for California’s success.
Embattled 
California
 Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
 said he is &#34;incredibly proud&#34; of 
President Biden
 amid the blowback from his botched 
Afghanistan
 withdrawal and doubled down on campaigning with him.
A local reporter asked Newsom Monday if the fallout from 
the withdrawal
 from Afghanistan would &#34;complicate&#34; whether Biden is &#34;the right person&#34; to campaign with ahead of the recall 
election
.
Newsom didn&#39;t directly answer the question, instead sharing his pride in the president and doubling down on campaigning with him.
BIDEN BACKS NEWSOM AS CALIFORNIA RECALL ELECTION LOOMS, URGES RESIDENTS TO ‘VOTE NO’
&#34;I’m incredibly proud of President Biden,&#34; Newsom responded. &#34;I’m incredibly enthusiastic to have his support on [a] ‘no’ vote and look forward to him coming out here.&#34;
Biden stumping for Newsom – as he and Vice President Harris have been considering since last week – could prove politically poisonous at the moment as the president deals with the fallout from the fall of Afghanistan.
&#34;Gov. [Newsom] is leading California through unprecedented crises – he&#39;s a key partner in fighting the pandemic and helping build our economy back better,&#34; Biden wrote on Twitter last week. &#34;To keep him on the job, registered voters should vote no on the recall election by 9/14 and keep California moving forward.&#34;

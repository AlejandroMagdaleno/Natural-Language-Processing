Shelley Luther, Dallas salon owner who was jailed for defying coronavirus orders, joins &#39;Fox and Friends Weekend.’
The 
Texas
 salon owner jailed for defying coronavirus lockdown orders spoke out at the 
Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)
 and recounted her fight for basic freedom rights. 
&#34;It wasn&#39;t about a hair salon, it wasn&#39;t about a haircut…you could get an abortion, you could get liquor to go in Texas…but you could not get your hair cut by trained stylists who have hours and hours of sanitation training…but it just comes down to common sense,&#34; Shelley Luther, owner of Salon a La Mode in Dallas, expressed at CPAC.

The Dallas business owner made waves back in May 2020 after reopening her hair salon during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic despite COVID restrictions. She was 
sentenced to serve seven days in jail
 but was 
let out
 after less than 48 hours.
&#34;I honestly think Republicans are used to just going with the flow, not causing any waves… if we don&#39;t stand up to this, who knows how long this is going to last?&#34; Luther told &#34;Fox &amp; Friends Weekend&#34; Saturday. 
THE FIVE BIGGEST MOMENTS OF CPAC&#39;S FIRST FULL DAY OF EVENTS
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott
 issued a statewide mask mandate in July 2020 during a surge in coronavirus cases but is considering ending the orders soon after evaluating the circumstances. 
At Salon a La Mode in Dallas, wearing a mask is optional.
&#34;I feel like people are grown adults and my stations are already 6 feet apart. So even if someone&#39;s not wearing a mask next to you, they&#39;re far enough away that it shouldn&#39;t bother you,&#34; Luther said.
Luther was one of the first small business owners to revolt against coronavirus shutdown orders by keeping her Dallas salon open.
&#34;I didn&#39;t even know what CPAC was a year ago and I&#39;m being totally honest…&#34; Luther mentioned. &#34;I thought I was very involved in what&#39;s going on until my business got taken from me, and then I realized I didn&#39;t know anything and I needed to wake up…&#34;

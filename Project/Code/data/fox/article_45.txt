A total of 228 Republican lawmakers urged the 
Supreme Court
 to overturn Roe v. Wade in an amicus brief filed Thursday stating that it&#39;s time to &#34;resolve the bitter culture war&#34; the 1973 decision started in regard to 
abortion rights.
The lawmakers, which included 44 senators and 184 House members, called for the reversal of the federal ruling in order to allow states to determine their own abortion laws.

They further called for the reversal of the 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey that found establishing restrictions on abortion were unconstitutional as they placed an &#34;undue burden&#34; on a woman prior to fetal viability.
The brief was filed following the Supreme Court’s decision earlier this year to hear a challenge on Mississippi’s 2018 ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

&#34;In taking Mississippi’s pro-life law, the Supreme Court has a chance to reconsider the current misguided abortion jurisprudence,&#34; Mississippi GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith said Thursday. &#34;As a Senator, as a woman, and as a mother, I think this case offers us a chance to overturn roe and return the abortion issue to the political process and away from activist judges.&#34;

President Biden
 appeared to get a bit confused Thursday when recalling his 
daughter&#39;s wedding
 during a virtual event to celebrate the start of the 
Jewish
 High Holidays.
While much of the event focused on recent 
anti-Semitic
 attacks, 
Afghanistan
, and the hope for renewal, the 
Roman Catholic
 president ended his remarks by calling for religious collaboration down the road, pointing to his daughter Ashley&#39;s 2012 marriage to Jewish doctor Howard Krein.
&#34;We wanted to have a co-confessional wedding,&#34; Biden said. &#34;And we had a chuppah on the altar, and we had a co- … it was co-officiated. Now, some of you aren’t going to like this, but it was co-officiated by a Catholic priest as well as a Jewish rabbi.&#34;

The president then talked about his favorite Catholic hymn that he requested be played at the wedding.

said
. 
&#34;And it says, ‘May He lift you up on Eagle’s wings and bear you on the breath of dawn, and let the light shine upon you,’ et cetera, and — ‘and hold you in the palm of his hand.’ And they played and … I’m my mind is going blank now.  What’s the song that is played where everybody is on the chair?&#34; Biden added.  &#34;I can’t remember it. Anyway. And that’s the song that was played.&#34;

During the same event, Biden also told Jewish leaders that he spent time at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh after the October 2018 massacre left 11 people dead.

&#34;I remember spending time at the, you know, going to the, you know, the Tree of Life synagogue, speaking with them,&#34; Biden said in the virtual address.

New York Post
 that Biden didn&#39;t visit the synagogue in the years after the attack.

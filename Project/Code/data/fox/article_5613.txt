South Carolina senator sounds off on Vice President taking the lead on immigration on &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39;
A fired-up Sen. 
Lindsey Graham
, R-S.C., railed against President Biden&#39;s decision to tap Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 to oversee the administration&#39;s response to the border crisis in an appearance on &#34;
Fox News Primetime
&#34; Wednesday.
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: Look at what is happening at the border. It&#39;s changing for the worse because President Biden doesn&#39;t understand what he is doing when it comes to the border. He has got to put Vice President Harris in charge of cleaning up the mess at the border. I would gladly work with her, but she doesn&#39;t understand what has generated this problem. This is not a Trump problem. This is a Biden problem. 
It&#39;s pretty hard to fix a problem if you don&#39;t know what the problem is. So, I think the Republican Party is going to come roaring back, because this radical agenda will not go well with middle America ... The Biden administration did away with the &#39;Remain in Mexico&#39; policy that Trump had and by the summer, there is going to be at least a million people knocking on our door at the border unless they reinstate Trump policies. We will see if Vice President Harris can figure this out.

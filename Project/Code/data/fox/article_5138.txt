Dr. Harvey Risch of the Yale School of Public Health joins &#39;The Ingraham Angle&#39; with reaction 
President Biden
&#39;s COVID-19 relief 
package
 would put $128 billion toward helping 
K-12 public schools
 deal with the coronavirus pandemic, but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that just $6 billion would flow to schools in 2021.
The CBO estimates that the number would increase to $32 billion in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The rest of the money would be paid out through 2028, according to a 
cost estimate
 released Monday.
The $128.5 billion in Biden&#39;s American Rescue Plan would mainly flow as grants to state and local education agencies to distribute.
The comparatively small outlay for the fiscal year 2021, which runs through Sept. 30, 2021, is expected because previously allocated money has not yet been spent.

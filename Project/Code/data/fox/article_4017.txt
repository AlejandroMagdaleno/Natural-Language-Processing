The FOX News exclusive interview airs on April, 25 at 10 P.M. ET. with Dana Perino
Former President 
George W. Bush
 on Friday made a call for what he described as a &#34;gradual&#34; path to legal residency and eventually citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants -- while at the same time claiming that &#34;amnesty&#34; would be &#34;fundamentally unfair.&#34;
Bush, whose 2007 push for an immigration reform bill met with furious resistance from his own party, wrote an op-ed for 
The Washington Post
, in which he previewed a new book that he said will include &#34;principles for reform that can restore the people’s confidence in an immigration system that serves both our values and our interests.&#34;
BIDEN CALLED BUSH AND OBAMA BEFORE ANNOUNCING AFGHANISTAN TROOP WITHDRAWAL 
&#34;The help and respect historically accorded to new arrivals is one reason so many people still aspire and wait to become Americans. So how is it that in a country more generous to new arrivals than any other, immigration policy is the source of so much rancor and ill will?&#34; he asks.
Bush lists a number of steps that can be taken, beginning with permanent legal status to illegal immigrants who came to the country as children and were protected under the Obama-era 
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)
 program.
As for border security, nods to the present crisis at the southern border without mentioning it directly. He calls for &#34;a secure and efficient border...we should apply all the necessary resources -- manpower, physical barriers, advanced technology, streamlined and efficient ports of entry, and a robust legal immigration system -- to assure it.&#34;
As for illegal immigrants already in the country, Bush begins by saying that &#34;a grant of amnesty would be fundamentally unfair to those who came legally or are still waiting their turn to become citizens.&#34;
WHITE HOUSE SAYS BIDEN WILL INCREASE REFUGEE CAP THIS YEAR, AFTEM DEM FURY OVER ORIGINAL TARGET
However, he then immediately calls for those here illegally to be &#34;brought out of the shadows through a gradual process in which legal residency and citizenship must be earned, as for anyone else applying for the privilege.&#34; 
&#34;Requirements should include proof of work history, payment of a fine and back taxes, English proficiency and knowledge of U.S. history and civics, and a clean background check,&#34; he says.
Those calling for creating a pathway for residency and citizenship for illegal immigrants will often reject the term &#34;amnesty&#34; if their pathway includes certain hurdles or conditions that must be met over time
Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., who is the driving force in the Senate behind the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would offer a path to citizenship for all illegal immigrants currently in the country, has also rejected the claim that that bill is &#34;amnesty.&#34;
DEMS URGE BIDEN TO INCLUDE AMNESTY FOR SOME ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN SECOND SPENDING BILL
Bush’s 2007 push for immigration reform, which included a pathway to citizenship combined with stricter border measures, was killed in the Senate in part by Republicans who 
called it an amnesty bill
.
Bush also calls for a &#34;modernized asylum system&#34; increase legal immigration, as well as an improved temporary entry program to allow guest workers to come in temporarily.

Bush is releasing a book, &#34;
Out of Many, One
&#34; featuring portraits and stories of immigrants, next week.
It is unclear how Bush’s message will be received. The current comprehensive immigration bill being pushed by Democrats and the White House -- which includes a citizenship pathway, but is scant on border security -- has been roundly rejected by Republicans.
Meanwhile, smaller bills to grant citizenship to illegal immigrant farmworkers and DACA recipients, have been so far rejected by Republicans -- who say they will not play ball until the ongoing crisis at the southern border is fixed.

The Republican executive sounds off on &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39;
Georgia
 Gov. Brian Kemp blasted Major League Baseball after its commissioner, Rob Manfred Jr., 
pulled the All-Star Game
 out of Atlanta in response to the state&#39;s passage of a voting rights law on 
&#34;Tucker Carlson Tonight.&#34;
Georgia&#39;s Republican majority passed a law this week which 
President Biden
 notably called &#34;Jim Crow on steroids&#34;, that prohibits electioneering within several dozen feet of a poll, requires identification to register for an absentee ballot and expands weekend early voting.
&#34;I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year’s All-Star Game,&#34; Manfred said Friday.
Kemp fired back at Manfred&#39;s decision, pointing out that MLB is based in 
New York
 -- a state he said still has &#34;stricter&#34; voting laws than Georgia.
&#34;It&#39;s so hypocritical... Major League Baseball&#39;s headquartered in New York, Delta [Airlines] is flying in New York. I&#39;m sure Coca-Cola sells a lot of product in New York. When you look at New York&#39;s voting laws, you have to have an excuse to vote absentee by-mail in New York. You do not in Georgia,&#34; Kemp said.
Coke and Delta are two major Atlanta companies whose executives have ripped Kemp for signing the bill.
Kemp said Georgia has 17 days of in-person early voting, while New York has 10.
&#34;I guess we should be boycotting [MLB] for having their headquarters in New York because that law is more strict than ours,&#34; he said. &#34;I mean, this is all ridiculous.&#34;
Host 
Tucker Carlson
 added that, in Biden&#39;s case, his home state of 
Delaware
 also has preexisting stricter voting laws than the one passed in Georgia this week.

&#34;One thing Biden doesn&#39;t seem very interested in is his own home state, Delaware. Unlike Georgia, Delaware has never permitted mass early voting,&#34; Carlson said. &#34;Apparently Delaware is a white supremacist state,&#34; he continued, referencing the basis of Jim Crow.
Carlson went on to suggest that part of the reason Biden and the Democrats are ignoring Delaware&#39;s laws are because the First State has been a reliably blue state. Delaware&#39;s last gubernatorial or congressional GOP officeholder was Rep. Mike Castle, who left office in 2011.

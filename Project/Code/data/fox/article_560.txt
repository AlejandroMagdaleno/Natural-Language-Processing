Senator Ben Sasse Tuesday raised concern over a work done for 
Chinese
 telecom company Huawei by a White House nominee to a key intelligence post.
At a Senate Intelligence hearing Tuesday for Christopher Fonzone’s nomination as Office of the Director of National Intelligence general counsel, the Nebraska Republican asked Fonzone about Huawei&#39;s link to China&#39;s oppression of its Uyghur minority.
&#34;What do you think of the role that they&#39;ve played in the Chinese Communist Party&#39;s genocide in Xinjiang?&#34; Sasse asked. 
Huawei has been heavily sanctioned by the U.S. government, after accusations that its infrastructure equipment enables the Chinese Communist Party to surveil users. 
Fonzone, who served as a legal adviser to the National Security Council under 
President Obama
, advised Huawei on U.S. law in 2018, and says he performed less than 10 hours of work for the CCP-linked conglomerate.

The nominee said he was aware of DNI Avril Haines’ assessment that Huawei poses a &#34;significant counterintelligence risk&#34; and vowed he would use the latest intelligence available in any legal analysis. 
&#34;I&#39;m trying to ask a different question. I&#39;m trying to ask why would you make a decision to work for Huawei given who they are,&#34; Sasse said.
&#34;My firm asked if I would help address some questions on how U.S. administrative law works. I did a very small amount of analysis with respect to that question, less than 10 hours,&#34; Fonzone replied. 
&#34;Who did you think they [Huawei] were? Because they&#39;re the bad guys,&#34; Sasse pressed.

&#34;I did the work I did because a partner asked me to help a company understand U.S. law and that&#39;s the advice I provided in a very small amount of work and there&#39;s been no follow up with it since then,&#34; Fonzone replied.
&#34;This is a company that&#39;s involved in genocide and this is a company that habitually, systematically is involved in stealing IP from U.S. companies,&#34; Sasse said in response. &#34;Helping them with rulemaking or their understanding of rulemaking is not helping a morally neutral actor and it&#39;s not helping them comply with U.S. law, it&#39;s helping them figure out how they can skirt U.S. law.&#34;
The company has denied U.S. accusations that it is controlled by the ruling Communist Party or facilitates 
Chinese spying
.
After the hearing, Sasse said that Fonzone should not be confirmed to the role. &#34;This is straightforward: You can get a Senate-confirmed national security position or you can work for the Chinese Communist Party and its national champions like Huawei, but you shouldn’t do both,&#34; the senator said in a statement to Fox News.

&#34;Fonzone has earned praise for his national security experience – but that experience should have led him to politely decline an assignment to help Huawei. America’s message to the world should be clear: technological ties with the Chinese Communist Party are a national security risk.&#34;

New York City
 Mayor 
Bill de Blasio
 is so far mum after some of his city&#39;s police officers were seen on 
an alarming video
 being harassed by a group of men.
The city’s largest police union posted the video -- which shows several men surrounding an 
NYPD SUV
 and hurling insults at the officers inside -- to Twitter on Friday. They said it was recorded Tuesday in Manhattan’s Washington Heights neighborhood.

The men in the video, who wore masks concealing their identities, can be seen placing a small toy resembling a pig&#39;s head on the hood of the SUV and waving a damaged American flag.
The mayor&#39;s office did not respond to inquiries from Fox News. 
A police source told Fox News on Friday that the group&#39;s actions may have warranted at least a summons.

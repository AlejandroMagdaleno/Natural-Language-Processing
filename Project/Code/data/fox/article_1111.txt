Colion Noir, lawyer and gun rights activist, reacts on ‘Fox News Primetime.’
The 
Biden administration
 said Monday it &#34;looks forward&#34; to working with Congress to strengthen the federal gun background check system and to implement &#34;commonsense&#34; steps to reduce gun violence, urging the House to pass two measures that would &#34;close existing loopholes&#34; in the system.
&#34;Gun violence is a public health crisis,&#34; the 
Office of Management and Budget
 said in a statement of administration policy on Monday.
&#34;Every day, gun violence—community violence, domestic violence, suicides, and mass shootings—takes American lives and forever alters many more,&#34; OMB continued. &#34;Last year, we saw record levels of homicides in cities throughout our country, violence that disproportionately impacts Black and Latino communities.&#34;
PSAKI CALLS GUN CONTROL A &#39;PRIORITY&#39; FOR BIDEN ADMIN
OMB said the federal gun background check system &#34;is a proven tool to reduce gun violence and save lives.&#34;
&#34;This system, called the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, has kept millions of guns out of potentially dangerous hands,&#34; OMB continued. &#34;The Administration encourages the House to pass two bills that would help close existing loopholes in the system.&#34;

Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., and 131 cosponsors this month introduced H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, which would require a background check for every firearm sale.
The legislation would use the current background check process in the U.S. to &#34;ensure individuals prohibited from gun possession are not able to obtain firearms.&#34;
And Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., and 91 cosponsors introduced the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021, which would further strengthen background check procedures before a federal firearms licensee may transfer a firearm to a person who is not a licensee.
&#34;The Administration looks forward to working with Congress to strengthen the Federal gun background check system and take other commonsense steps to reduce gun violence,&#34; OMB said.
The statement comes after White House press secretary Jen Psaki last month called gun control a &#34;priority&#34; for the Biden administration.
&#34;The president is somebody, throughout his career, who has advocated for smart gun, smart gun safety measures,&#34; Psaki said. &#34;He is not afraid of standing up to the NRA – he has done it multiple times.&#34;
DEM GUN CONTROL BILL WOULD CREATE NATIONAL FIREARM REGISTRY, REQUIRE LICENSING
Psaki said gun control is &#34;a priority to him on a personal level.&#34;
The National Rifle Association 
recently vowed
 to oppose any push from Biden: &#34;It will be up to these millions of law-abiding gun owners, and millions of NRA members, to make their voices heard in opposition to any infringement upon their constitutional rights.&#34;
The NRA did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.
Psaki’s comments came after Biden, on the three-year anniversary of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., called on Congress to take action.

&#34;This administration will not wait for the next mass shooting to heed that call,&#34; Biden said in a White House statement Sunday. &#34;We will take action to end our epidemic of gun violence and make our schools and communities safer.&#34;
He added: &#34;Today, I am calling on Congress to enact commonsense gun law reforms, including requiring background checks on all gun sales, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and eliminating immunity for gun manufacturers who knowingly put weapons of war on our streets.&#34;
&#34;We owe it to all those we’ve lost and to all those left behind to grieve to make a change,&#34; Biden said. &#34;The time to act is now.&#34;

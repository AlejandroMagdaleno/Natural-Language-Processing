Uvalde, Texas, Mayor Don McLaughlin Jr. on what he&#39;s seen firsthand of the border crisis.
Democrats and liberal media outlets questioned claims from House Minority Leader 
Kevin McCarthy
, R-Calif., about people on the &#34;terrorist watch list&#34; being detained while attempting to cross 
the southern border
, but new information shows that McCarthy was right. 
McCarthy delivered the warning about the &#34;terrorist watch list&#34; on Monday during an interview outside El Paso, Texas, shortly after speaking with border agents, who warned about foreign nationals on the terrorist watch list entering the United States.
BORDER &#39;DISORDER&#39; EXPLOITED BY POTENTIAL TERRORISTS, GOP LAWMAKERS SAY
 
&#34;When you go out to Monument 3 and you talk to those agents, it’s not just people from Mexico or Honduras or El Salvador, they are now finding people from Yemen, Iran, Turkey,&#34; McCarthy said. &#34;People on the terrorist watch list they are catching and they are rushing it all at once.&#34;
McCarthy&#39;s remarks were met with skepticisim from Democrats. 
&#34;Weird as the Chairman of the subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations and a border state member of Congress haven’t heard anything about this,&#34; Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., tweeted. &#34;Gonna ask for a briefing. Pretty sure he is either wrong or lying.&#34;
In another tweet, Gallego noted he has the &#34;same security clearance&#34; as McCarthy and requested a classified briefing so other committee members could &#34;see where this info derived from.&#34;
Gallego wasn’t the only Democrat who attacked McCarthy over the &#34;terrorist watch list&#34; soundbite. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, accused McCarthy of trying to &#34;
fuel the divisions
&#34; and target immigrants.
Multiple media outlets, including MSNBC and Vox, attempted to push the narrative that McCarthy was wrong. An MSNBC article 
claimed
 McCarthy &#34;Pushes his luck at border&#34; with the terror watch list claim, and a Vox article 
claimed
 McCarthy was pushing &#34;one of Trump’s most notorious immigration lies.&#34;

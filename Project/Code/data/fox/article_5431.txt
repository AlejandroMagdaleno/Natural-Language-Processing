Foreign Affairs Committee member discusses the political impact of the Afghanistan crisis on &#39;America Reports&#39; 
House
 Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said during a Tuesday news conference that there is &#34;no way&#34; 
President Biden
 will be able to evacuate all of the Americans currently trapped in Afghanistan by the Aug. 31 deadline.
&#34;There&#39;s no possible way that we can get every American that&#39;s still in Afghanistan out in the next seven days,&#34; McCarthy said after leaving a classified briefing on the evacuation efforts. 
&#34;We are just 3 weeks away from the 20th anniversary of 9/11,&#34; the California Republican continued. &#34;At no time should America … allow the Taliban to tell us when we have to stop bringing Americans out. We should stay until every single American is able to get out of Afghanistan.
DAN CRENSHAW ISSUES BLISTERING RESPONSE TO TALIBAN&#39;S DEMAND ALL US TROOPS LEAVE BY AUG. 31
McCarthy’s comments come as the Biden administration scrambles to evacuate thousands of Americans currently stranded in Afghanistan and reports have circulated that the U.S. military has begun pulling troops from the Hamid Karzai International Airport despite reports of thousands of Americans still stranded in the country.
SASSE URGES BIDEN TO TELL TALIBAN &#39;WE&#39;RE GETTING OUR PEOPLE OUT HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES&#39;: &#39;DAMN THE DEADLINE
On Monday, the Biden administration would not 
commit
 to extending the August 31 deadline negotiated with the Taliban in order to ensure that every American, roughly 8,000 by 
some estimates
, could be evacuated. The White House appeared to open the door to possibly extending the deadline saying that the president 
asked
 the Pentagon to prepare &#34;contingency plans to adjust the timeline should that become necessary.&#34;

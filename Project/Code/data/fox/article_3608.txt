Exclusive:
 Former President Trump&#39;s controversial ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, is set to publish a tell-all memoir of his time in office entitled, &#34;Sledgehammer,&#34; Fox News has learned. 
The book is set to be released on Feb. 8, 2022 and will be published by Broadside Books, the conservative branch of Harper Collins. 
The memoir will offer a behind-the-scenes look at how the Trump administration brokered the Abraham Accords. Friedman will detail how he led the U.S. in its &#34;steadfast and historic&#34; support of Israel, which some expected to result in an &#34;explosion of violence,&#34; according to a source at Harper Collins. 
The Abraham Accords normalized relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, Kosovo and Morocco.

&#34;The Abraham Accords will help the Middle East emerge from its lengthy history of conflict and lead the world in combatting extremism through opportunity, prosperity and hope. I wrote this book to help achieve a greater public understanding of these inspiring and critical agreements,&#34; Friedman said of the forthcoming book. 
&#34;It’s rare in politics to get a candid and thoughtful account from key players at historic moments, and we’re proud to have this one,&#34; said Harper Collins VP and Editorial Director Eric Nelson.
A bankruptcy lawyer without any diplomatic experience, Friedman grew to become a top advisor on one of the Trump administration&#39;s proudest accomplishments. Over the years, he has spoken out in support of Israeli settlements, declaring them legal, a position which drew fire during his Senate confirmation. Ultimately, during his confirmation hearing, he agreed to end his support of the expansion of Israeli settlements, echoing a Trump assessment that expansion was &#34;not a good thing for peace.&#34;

The book&#39;s title, &#34;Sledgehammer,&#34; is a double entendre for both the ending of status quo in Israel policy and a moment in 2019 when Friedman took a sledgehammer to a wall at the unveiling of a new archaeological site in Jerusalem’s City of David, which lies underneath the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan. The move was provocative, as Israel ambassadors have long avoided public appearances in East Jerusalem, so as not to openly appear on Israel&#39;s side in the conflict with the Palestinians.

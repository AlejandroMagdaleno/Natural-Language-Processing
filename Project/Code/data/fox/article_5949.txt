Virginia parents slam Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Terry McAuliffe&#39;s claim that parents should not be telling schools what to teach.
Terry McAuliffe, the 
Democrat
 running for governor in Virginia during an off-year election, was seen in a video teleconference raising concern about 
President Biden
’s popularity in the state amid the election seen as a bellwether and referendum on the president&#39;s time in office.
BIDEN FACES HOSTILE PROTESTERS AFTER ARRIVING IN MICHIGAN TO PUSH AGENDA
The 12-second video was posted online by the Republican National Committee late Tuesday that appeared to show the hopeful in a Zoom meeting with about a dozen others.
&#34;We got to get Democrats out to vote,&#34; he said. &#34;We are facing a lot of headwinds from Washington, as you know. The president is unpopular today, unfortunately here in Virginia, so we have got to plow through.&#34;
The video cuts off after the remark. McAuliffe’s campaign did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News. 
Republicans seized on the video clip. Tommy Pigott, a rapid response director for the GOP, tweeted out that a recent poll showed 46% of the state approves of Biden’s performance. 
&#34;And just like Virginia is rejecting Biden, voters will reject McAuliffe in November,&#34; he posted.
McAuliffe is facing Republican Glenn Youngkin, and recent polls suggest a close race. McAuliffe is seeking a second term after his first ended in 2018. Youngkin is a former business executive.

McAuliffe has tried to tie Youngkin to former President Trump, who lost Virginia by 10 points. At one point he called Youngkin &#34;bought and paid for&#34; by the former president. Youngkin has sought to portray McAuliffe as a failed politician.
Rachael Bade, a reporter for Politico, told ABC&#39;s &#34;This Week&#34; that McAuliffe has been showing Democrats how to run and has &#34;definitely been distancing himself&#34; from the president during the campaign.
James Hohmann, a columnist for the Washington Post, wrote in a 
recent column
 that Youngkin &#34;ripped Biden during the final debate in Alexandria on Tuesday for &#39;an abject failure of leadership&#39; in Afghanistan and the ‘absolute chaos’ at the southern border. McAuliffe didn’t come to the president’s defense on either issue. Instead, he said a $3.5 trillion price tag for the Democratic reconciliation package is ‘too high.’&#34;

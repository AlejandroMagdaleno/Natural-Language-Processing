Defense Secretary Gen. Lloyd Austin
 did not accept the committee&#39;s invitation to testify at a hearing dealing with the U.S. withdrawal from 
Afghanistan

The senator went on to say that Austin&#39;s decision not to come before the committee &#34;will affect my personal judgment on Department of Defense nominees.&#34; Menendez then said that he expects Austin to appear before the committee at a future opportunity.

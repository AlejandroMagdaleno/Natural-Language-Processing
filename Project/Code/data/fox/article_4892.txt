Climate activist Isra Hirsi, the 18-year-old daughter of Rep. 
Ilhan Omar
, D-
Minn
., added the communist hammer and sickle to her 
Twitter
 bio and has openly called for a communist revolution online.

In addition to this, a year ago she openly called for a communist &#34;revolution&#34; online and is reportedly in charge of writing some of her mother’s tweets.
Hirsi will be attending Columbia University in New York City this fall.
Throughout the last century, communist regimes have resulted in oppression and death 
for tens of millions
 of people worldwide, including and especially in the nascent Soviet Union. It is then that the hammer and sickle symbol was first adopted among the proletariat, or working class, and has since become the international emblem of communism.
The congresswoman&#39;s daughter has amassed a massive following on Twitter and Instagram through her work with the U.S. Youth Climate Strike. She has also spoken at prestigious venues, including giving her own 
TED talk
 at Wake Forest University in North Carolina titled &#34;An Angry Black Girl.&#34;
Hirsi was also named to 
Forbes&#39;
 &#34;40 Under 40 Government and Politics&#34; list in 2020, has been 
featured 
in New York Magazine, and has been described as &#34;saving the planet&#34; by 
Vice News
 for her climate change work.

panelist
 for a climate conference at her soon-to-be alma mater in February and 
gave a lecture

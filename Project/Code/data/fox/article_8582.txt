Senate Judiciary Committee member predicts successful 2022 and 2024 for Republicans on &#39;The Ingraham Angle&#39;
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois accused each other of lying about stimulus checks being cut to illegal immigrants.
On Monday, Durbin — the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate — wrote a tweet accusing Cruz of &#34;trying to rile people up over misinformation.&#34;
&#34;We simply cannot stand by and allow outright falsehoods to be propagated on the Senate floor,&#34; Durbin wrote. &#34;It’s time for GOP Senators like Ted Cruz to stop trying to rile people up over misinformation.&#34;
TED CRUZ IN CPAC SPEECH SAYS &#39;TRUMP AIN’T GOING ANYWHERE,&#39; JOKES ABOUT CANCUN CONTROVERSY
Cruz hit back hard on Twitter, replying to Durbin’s accusation with one of his own.
&#34;This is twice in three days that Durbin has called me a liar,&#34; wrote Cruz. &#34;He’s the one who’s lying. And he knows it.&#34;
He then blasted Durbin for &#34;refus[ing]&#34; to take his question during their heated exchange on the Senate floor, saying the Democratic Whip has made Twitter his &#34;forum&#34; of choice.
&#34;Dick, on the Senate floor, you refused to take my question. You’ve chosen Twitter as your forum,&#34; added Cruz. &#34;Ok, respond with FACTS — not just partisan invective.&#34;
The Texas senator continued on his thread with a pop quiz of nine questions pertaining to illegal immigrants receiving Covid-19 stimulus checks, pointing out that &#34;60% of illegal aliens are visa overstays&#34; as well as why &#34;every Dem vote[d] against&#34; his amendment &#34;prohibiting sending $1400 checks to illegal immigrants.&#34;
&#34;True or false: Migrants who come to US legally on a work visa are allowed to have a SSN, yet when they overstay their visa they become illegal aliens,&#34; Cruz asked.
Cruz’s final question to Durbin was whether or not &#34;the Lefty journos echoing your false charge&#34; will &#34;also apologize?&#34;
When asked for comment on the tweets, Cruz’s office referred Fox News back to the tweet thread. Durbin’s office did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

House 
Democrats
 rejected a Republican push on Tuesday to consider legislation that would apply sanctions on Hamas militants amid an escalating military conflict with 
Israel
.
Democrats blocked a bid to bring the Palestinian International Terrorism Support Prevention Act up for consideration in a 217-209 vote along party lines. The bill, introduced by Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., would impose sanctions on foreign entities known to have provided financial assistance to Hamas, among other measures.
&#34;Under my bill the United States will sanction these groups that are supporting terrorism,&#34; Mast said in a floor speech in support of the legislation. &#34;Or if we do not pass this bill, we will not stand together to sanction these groups that are enabling this terrorism.&#34;
Mast was reintroducing the bill, which had passed the House unanimously in 2019 but was not taken up for a vote in the Senate. Republicans Tuesday brought the bill up for consideration through a procedure known as the previous question, which functions as a call to end debate on a measure and bring it up for an immediate vote.
PENCE SLAMS BIDEN ADMIN FOR TRYING TO CREATE A ‘FALSE EQUIVALENCY’ BETWEEN ISRAEL, HAMAS
Prior to the vote, Mast’s bill drew support from prominent Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. Mast had previously penned a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Gregory Meeks to expedite a vote on the bill.
&#34;The ongoing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians show why America must unequivocally support Israel, condemn Hamas, and sanction those who fund terrorism,&#34; McCarthy wrote on Twitter.

The Biden administration has faced intense pressure from lawmakers on its response to the crisis. Prominent Democrats, including Pelosi, have called for a cease-fire, while progressives such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have criticized Biden for not speaking against the Israeli government’s actions.
Meanwhile, Republicans have pressed Biden to affirm U.S. support for the Israeli government. A group of Senate Republicans led by Sen. Rick Scott of Florida drafted a resolution affirming Israel’s &#34;right to defend itself against terrorist attacks.&#34;

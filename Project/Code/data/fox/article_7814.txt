Republican senators are ramping up pressure on 
President Biden
 to withdraw Tracy Stone-Manning&#39;s nomination for Bureau of Land Management (BLM) director, citing her 
link to an eco-terrorist plot
 and her apparently 
misleading answers
 to senators about it. 
Every Republican on the Senate Energy Committee signed a letter Wednesday urging Biden to pull Stone-Manning&#39;s nomination. 
OBAMA&#39;S LAND MANAGEMENT DIRECTOR SAYS BIDEN NOMINEE SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED OVER TREE-SPIKING PLOT
&#34;Ms. Stone-Manning has made false and misleading statements in a sworn statement to the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources (Committee) regarding her activities associated with an eco-terrorist cell whose tree spiking in Idaho’s Clearwater National Forest in 1989 put lives at risk,&#34; the senators wrote. 
&#34;We believe that Ms. Stone-Manning’s false and misleading statements, as well as her extremist activities, disqualify her from serving as Director of this important agency,&#34; the senators added in the 
letter
. 
&#34;As you are aware, the BLM manages one in every ten acres of land in the United States, and approximately thirty percent of the nation’s minerals. The BLM also manages close to 65 million acres of forests and woodlands across twelve western states and Alaska. Any individual who leads this important agency must have the faith and trust of the American people. Ms. Stone-Manning has violated this trust.&#34;

The White House didn&#39;t immediately return Fox News&#39; request for comment, though Biden has so far 
continued to back
 the embattled nominee.

yet to reveal
 how he intends to vote on the nomination.

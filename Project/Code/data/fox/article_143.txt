Former Milwaukee Police Chief Ed Flynn talks about the struggle to recruit new officers amid a rise in crime and anti-police culture
A year after cities across the U.S. saw riots following the death of 
George Floyd
, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said faith and community leaders can help avert a spike in violent crime this summer.
Ellison spoke to ABC&#39;s &#34;This Week&#34; days after former Minneapolis police officer 
Derek Chauvin
 received a 22.5-year sentence for Floyd&#39;s murder and agreed with President Biden that communities could be at risk in the coming months.

Ellison said religious and community leaders, in conjunction with law enforcement officials, could help &#34;stave off what could be a difficult summer if we don&#39;t get ahead of it.&#34;
He said that at a recent Minneapolis community meeting there was a group of pastors who work with law enforcement as part of an initiative called 21 Days of Peace. Those pastors asked police where the neighborhood hot spots are, and people from the community went and occupied them, resulting in reductions in violence at several of those locations.

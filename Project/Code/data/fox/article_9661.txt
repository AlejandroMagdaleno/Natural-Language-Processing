Parents Jeana Weng and Dan Glatz say they are &#39;worried about safety&#39; and warn that &#39;this is one more issue&#39; for students to want to leave the school district. 
Parents of first graders at a Washington state 
school
 had their concerns ignored by the local school board and administration after a teacher read a book on transgender issues to the class, according to a report. 
I Am Jazz — a children’s book illustrating the transition of a two-year-old biological boy into a girl — was read to the first grade students of the Bellingham School District, sparking concerns from parents.
However, both the school’s administration and school board — whose president, Jennifer Mason, runs a sex toy shop in town open to &#34;
all-ages
&#34; that only sells to those 16 and up — ignored the concerns of parents and refused to take action, according to Young Americans for Freedom (YAF), a conservative organization.
An anonymous parent at the school emailed first-grade teacher asking if she had read the book to her class. 
‘WOKE’ NYC SCHOOL CURRICULUM PROMPTS DAD TO MOVE DAUGHTER TO FLORIDA
&#34;Yes, I did read this book,&#34; the teacher replied. &#34;As a district we are working hard to support all members of our school community and promote inclusion through understanding and compassion.&#34;
YAF posted a copy of the emails online. 
&#34;Woke&#34; curriculums in schools have come under scrutiny by parents recently. Harvey Goldman, a parent that formerly lived in New York City, was so fed up by the race-based curriculum in his daughter’s school that he 
pulled her out
 and moved to Florida.

&#34;Little children don’t need to feel bad about the color of their skin,&#34; Goldman said on 
Fox and Friends
 last month. &#34;That’s what they’re teaching them, to feel bad about who they are.&#34;
Neither Baker nor Mason responded to Fox News’ request for comment.

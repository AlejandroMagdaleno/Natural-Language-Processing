National Border Patrol Council Vice President Hector Garza offers other solutions that he argues will be more effective than sending payments to Central American nations.
National Border Patrol Council Vice President Hector Garza said on &#34;
America’s Newsroom
&#34; on Tuesday that more needs to be done to &#34;stem the flow of 
illegal immigration
&#34; and offered solutions that he argued will be more effective than sending payments to Central American nations as reportedly 
proposed by the Biden administration
.
The U.S. is considering a &#34;conditional cash transfer program&#34; to address what the 
White House
 believes are the economic woes that lead migrants to make the journey to the U.S. southern border, 
Reuters reported 
on Friday. The plan also involves sending COVID-19 vaccines to the countries in Central America. 
&#34;Clearly these countries need a lot of help,&#34; Garza said on Tuesday, citing the &#34;hard times in these countries,&#34; including gangs and violence.  
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCES SKY-HIGH BORDER NUMBERS, LOOKS TO BLAME TRUMP
He then noted that the U.S. &#34;sent this money before to these countries and unfortunately because of the corruption, that money does not really get to the people that actually need it.&#34; 
&#34;One of the main solutions that we need to work on is is the MMP [
Migrant Protection Protocols
], the 
asylum cooperative agreements
 that 
President Trump
 worked on and we also need to make sure that we send the right message in the 
media
 that our border is not open and that those policies reflect a closed border type of scenario,&#34; Garza continued.

President Biden has scrapped a number of former President Trump&#39;s immigration policies, which included wall construction and having asylum seekers remain in Mexico instead of staying in the U.S. while they wait for their cases to be heard. 
The moves have led to a record surge in migrants, including unaccompanied minors, that has strained capacity at immigration facilities in recent weeks.

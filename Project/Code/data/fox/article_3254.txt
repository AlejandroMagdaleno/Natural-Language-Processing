Facebook removed an ad run by Trump’s re-election campaign featuring an upside down red triangle similar to one used by Nazis; reaction and analysis from FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr on ‘America’s Newsroom.’
A push by congressional Democrats to block the sale of a Spanish-language Florida radio station to conservative owners would effectively turn the 
Federal Communications Commission
 into an &#34;arm&#34; of the 
Democratic National Committee
, the senior Republican on the commission warned. 
FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr blasted the congressional Democrats’ attempt to pressure the commission into blocking the sale of a Spanish-speaking radio station in Miami, Florida, saying the move was politically-based in a statement released Tuesday.
He also warned the move by the Democrats crosses a constitutional line and would weaponize the FCC for the DNC.
&#34;Democrats in Congress are pressuring the FCC to block the sale of a radio station based on the political viewpoints it would broadcast to South Florida’s Hispanic community,&#34; Carr wrote in a tweet accompanying the release. &#34;This crosses a clear line drawn by the First Amendment and would turn the FCC into an arm of the DNC.&#34;
BIDEN’S $100B INTERNET OVERHAUL WILL HURT CONSUMERS, STIFLE INNOVATION: FORMER FCC CHAIRMAN
In his statement, Carr said the FCC had &#34;no business doing the Democrats’ bidding or using our regulatory process to censor political opinions that Democrats do not like.&#34;
Carr also torched the congressional Democrats for trying to pressure the FCC into taking action they think will increase their odds of winning elections in the Sunshine State.
&#34;This is a deeply troubling transgression of free speech and the FCC’s status as an independent agency,&#34; wrote Carr, who called on his fellow FCC colleagues to join him in &#34;publicly rejecting this attempt to inject partisan politics into our licensing process.&#34;
&#34;Doing so would go a long way in assuring the public that the FCC will review this proposed transaction free from political pressure and according to our long-standing rules and precedents.&#34;

Last week, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus put pressure on the FCC to pull the plug on the potential acquisition of the popular local, Spanish-speaking radio station Caracol 1260 AM by America CV. America CV&#39;s parent company, America TeVé, is a conservative-owned company.
&#34;Enough is enough. We can no longer allow conservative media to lead Spanish-language misinformation campaigns on Florida&#39;s Latino communities,&#34; Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., said on 
Twitter
 last week. &#34;It&#39;s time for the FCC to intervene. This dangerous rhetoric can&#39;t go unchecked.&#34;

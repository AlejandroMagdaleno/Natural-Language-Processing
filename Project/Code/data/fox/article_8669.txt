Former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson breaks down the latest reporting on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo&#39;s handling of nursing homes early in the pandemic.
Gov.
 Cuomo
 created a toxic work environment that dates back at least to his time as state attorney general — and includes rages that can last for days, former aides and associates said Thursday.
Cuomo
 once chewed out an aide so harshly that &#34;he made her cry,&#34; a source familiar with the incident recalled. &#34;Young people work for him thinking they will rise up with him. Older people are stuck because they need a job and benefits.’’ 
CUOMO ADVISERS ALTERED REPORT ON CORONAVIRUS NURSING HOME DEATHS: WSJ
Back when he was AG from 2007 through 2010, Cuomo viciously teed off on a veteran State Police investigator in his 60s who accidentally mispronounced his name as &#34;Como,&#34; according to a source familiar with that incident. 
&#34;What’s my name?&#34; Cuomo thundered in front of a group of people. &#34;How do you pronounce it? Spell it!&#34;
In addition to berating the cop, Cuomo transferred him out of his security detail.
During his 2018 gubernatorial re-election campaign, an insider recalled, Cuomo apparently became &#34;livid&#34; just because his Republican challenger, Marc Molinaro, suddenly appeared at the Manhattan’s Columbus Day Parade and shook his hand.

A Cuomo spokesman said the governor &#34;had a great time at the parade.&#34;
&#34;‎Many of us have been here for years and others have left and come back,&#34; senior adviser Rich Azzopardi said in a statement. &#34;This job isn’t for everyone but we work hard every day to deliver for New Yorkers, and from a $15 minimum wage, to the strongest gun safety laws in the nation to free public college tuition we’ve cut through the red tape and delivered for New York.&#34;
CUOMO ACCUSER LINDSEY BOYLAN CALLS ON &#39;BYSTANDERS&#39; TO &#39;ACTIVATE&#39; AND SAY SOMETHING
Meanwhile, the recent allegation by Assemblyman Ron Kim (D-Queens) that Cuomo 
threatened to &#34;destroy&#34;
 him isn’t the first time the governor has engaged in that sort of intimidation, according to a source who formerly worked with him.
About five years ago, the source said, he heard Cuomo bellowing into a phone, &#34;I will destroy you!&#34;

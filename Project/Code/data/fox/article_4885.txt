&#39;FOX &amp;amp; Friends Weekend&#39; co-host Pete Hegseth weighs in on the congresswoman&#39;s promotion on &#39;FOX News Primetime&#39;
Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.
, criticized 
President Biden&#39;s
 decision to tighten income limits on

 relief, arguing that he was sending less money to people than his predecessor did.
&#34;I see it as a really disappointing development,&#34; she told CNN anchor Brianna Keilar. &#34;We obviously are now ultimately sending money to less people than the Trump administration and the Senate majority Republicans were willing to -- there are going to be about 17 million people who will get less money.&#34;

&#34;This is not the promise that we made,&#34; she added. &#34;This is not what we are given the opportunity to be in the majority in the Senate and have the White House.

&#34;This is just us now negotiating amongst ourselves,&#34; she said. &#34;The House is controlled by Democrats, the Senate is controlled by Democrats, the White House is in the hands of an administration that is a Democrat and so I don&#39;t know how this makes any political sense and it certainly does not make any policy sense.&#34;

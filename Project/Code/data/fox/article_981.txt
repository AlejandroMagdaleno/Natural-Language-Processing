Real Clear Politics White House reporter Phil Wegmann joins &#39;FOX Report&#39; to discuss the president&#39;s anticipated speech
Treasury Secretary 
Janet Yellen
 would become 
president of the United States
 in the case of a hypothetical Capitol disaster since President 
Biden
 has not named a &#34;designated survivor&#34; for his Wednesday address to Congress.
A designated survivor is the person in the presidential line of succession chosen not to attend an event in the case of a mass casualty event that kills all other potential successors; designated survivors typically stay in an undisclosed location during important events.
BIDEN SAYS NO MASKS OUTDOORS FOR FULLY VACCINATED PEOPLE STEP TOWARD &#39;NORMAL LIVING&#39;
&#34;There does not need to be a designated survivor because the Cabinet will be watching from their offices or their homes,&#34; White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a Tuesday briefing when asked whether the president would have a designated survivor during Wednesday&#39;s speech in light of COVID-19 audience restrictions keeping some Cabinet members home.
The White House clarified to Fox News that because of the White House&#39;s decision, Yellen would take over as president in the case of a catastrophe unless Democratic Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, Senate president pro-tempore, decides not to attend the event in person, in which case he would fall next in the line of succession.

Yellen is the defacto-designated survivor in this case because the No. 1 successor, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, will be in attendance at Biden&#39;s speech on Wednesday.
The president will be delivering an address Wednesday before a joint session of Congress at 9 p.m. EST.

The New Jersey Democratic State Committee (NJDSC) issued an ad replete with profanity Monday to attack Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli for once supporting a law to ban cursing when he served on the Raritan Borough Council.
The ordinance, which Raritan passed 5-0 in 1994, 
prohibited
 &#34;rude or indecent behavior&#34; and included both profanity and &#34;insulting remarks.&#34;
The NJDSC ad spotlights several individuals who react to the swearing ban idea with profanity-laden phrases, such as, &#34;You’re sh***ng me,&#34; &#34;No f**king way,&#34; &#34;This is f**king New Jersey,&#34; and &#34;We can’t let that a**hole win.&#34;

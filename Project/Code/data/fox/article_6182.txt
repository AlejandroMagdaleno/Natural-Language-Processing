A western 
Michigan
 man was arraigned Tuesday, accused of 
making death threats
 against 
President Biden
, House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 and Michigan Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer
, the state attorney general&#39;s office confirmed in a release.
Joshua Docter, 21, of Holland, Mich., faces two felony counts of threat of 
terrorism
 and using a computer to commit a crime, according to FOX 17 in Grand Rapids, Mich. 
&#34;Threatening elected officials is against the law and my office will prosecute those who attempt to intimidate or terrorize our state and federal leaders,&#34; Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement. &#34;I appreciate the thorough investigative work by the FBI and Michigan State Police on this case, and I consider it another excellent example of showcasing the dedication that those working in law enforcement have to protecting the public.&#34;

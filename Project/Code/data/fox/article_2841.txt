New York
 Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 has retained a prominent white-collar defense attorney as it grapples with

 and 
Justice Department

COVID-19

Elkan Abramowitz, a one-time federal prosecutor, confirmed he was representing the Executive Chamber—which comprises the governor and his closest aides—in both the sexual harassment and nursing-home matters. Rich Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Mr. Cuomo, deferred comment to Mr. Abramowitz.
The Democratic governor faces an investigation overseen by State Attorney General Letitia James into whether he sexually harassed women who previously worked in his administration. Mr. Cuomo acknowledged he had sometimes been overly personal while interacting with staff and 
said he was sorry
 if anyone mistook it for unwanted flirtation.
Mr. Cuomo said last week that the state is cooperating with three inquiries from the Brooklyn-based U.S. attorney’s office in the Eastern District of New York as well as the Justice Department’s Civil Rights and Civil divisions, which are based in 
Washington

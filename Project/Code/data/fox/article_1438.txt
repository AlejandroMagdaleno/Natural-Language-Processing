President Joe Biden
 declined to call on U.S. reporters Tuesday after British Prime Minister 
Boris Johnson
 took questions from reporters from the United Kingdom during an Oval Office meeting.
After a brief conversation with Biden that touched on issues ranging from climate change and transport infrastructure to lifting the ban on British beef, Johnson opened the floor for reporters from his home country.
&#34;Would it be okay if we have just a couple of questions, just a couple?&#34; Johnson asked, looking over to Biden, who replied, &#34;Good luck.&#34;
BIDEN REPEATEDLY IMPLIES HE&#39;S NOT IN CHARGE OF WHEN, WHERE HE CAN TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE PRESS
After Johnson had taken several questions from British reporters, the press pool was then corraled out of the Oval Office while Johnson was mid-sentence, prompting a flurry of shouted questions from reporters. 
Biden appeared to briefly answer one shouted question as the pool exited, saying, &#34;The violence is unacceptable.&#34; It is not clear what the question was. 
White House reporters made a formal complaint with the White House about not getting any formal questions while the British press asked away.

Biden has 
raised eyebrows
 for repeatedly implying that White House staff controls when and where he is 
allowed to take questions
 from the press. He has used phrases that suggest he is being &#34;instructed&#34; on which reporters to call on from a pre-selected list. On several occasions, he has said he is &#34;going to get in trouble&#34; if he answers questions from reporters.
The White House has also apparently 
cut the feed
 from several Biden events, most recently during a 
Sept. 13 briefing
 on wildfires with federal and state officials in Boise, Idaho.

&#39;The Next Revolution&#39; host Steve Hilton blasts Biden’s left-wing policies and recent ‘President Harris’ gaffe.
Fox News host 
Steve Hilton
 said Friday that 
Joe Biden
 is not in charge of the 
White House
 and the president &#34;in name only&#34; based on his administration&#39;s left-wing agenda, compared to his campaign as more of a centrist. 
BIDEN STUMBLES MULTIPLE TIMES, FALLS AS HE SCALES AIR FORCE ONE STAIR
STEVE HILTON: &#34;The capacity of our Commander in Chief is a vital public issue. It’s not just this gaffe there’s one of these almost every day where he seems to forget where he is or what he’s doing. He stumbles he mumbles...
He clearly at the very least doesn’t have the energy to do the job. But, more seriously from a substantive basis, you only have to look at the agenda that’s being pursued to see that Joe Biden is president in name only. He ran with a very clear centrist message. He said look I’m Joe Biden you know who I am. I’m not going to do this crazy left stuff. Yet what do we have? We have an agenda that is completely driven by the power bases within the Democratic Party. Which is very clear...
The government unions and the woke left and of course, the permanent bureaucracy are pushing for things like going back to the Iran deal. He’s not in charge and that’s why this is a massive issue of public importance.&#34;

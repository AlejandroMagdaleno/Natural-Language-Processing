Fox News contributor Dan Bongino talks recent Hunter Biden interview and his admission about the laptop dropped off at a Delaware computer repair shop.
Fox News contributor 
Dan Bongino
 said Monday that the &#34;justice system is blind to 
Democrats&#34;
 and asserted that 
Hunter Biden
 would likely not face charges regarding his DOJ investigation. 
HUNTER BIDEN ‘100% CERTAIN’ HE’LL BE CLEARED OF WRONGDOING IN DOJ INVESTIGATION
DAN BONGINO: 
It&#39;s Hunter Biden’s laptop, signed by Hunter Biden, billed to Hunter Biden with pictures of Hunter Biden, with Hunter Biden’s emails, but gosh, whose computer could that possibly be?
...
Listen, I’m sorry, I gave up on the Justice Department a long time ago. I’m sorry. Show me evidence otherwise. If this was Donald Trump Jr.’s laptop with pictures of Donald Trump Jr, signed by Donald Trump Jr. and billed to Donald Trump Jr, he’d be in a federal prison right now for 25 years for selling the country out to China. But, because it’s Hunter, nah you do interviews and sell a book on it. You want me to have faith in the justice system? The justice system is blind – to Democrats. To Republicans, their eyes are wide open. It’s disgusting.

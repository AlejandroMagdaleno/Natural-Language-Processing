The creative director at the left-wing Sunrise Movement claimed Tuesday that he was fired after accusing leadership of ignoring Black members&#39; demands, generating internal conflict within the group dedicated to youth 
activism
 against 
climate change
.
Alex O&#39;Keefe said he was terminated after sending a letter with demands from the &#34;Sunrise Black Caucus&#34; calling on Sunrise Movement to &#34;publicly reckon with the movement-wide crisis we are in [and] dismantle our white, owning-class culture.&#34;
LIBERAL DARK MONEY-LED COALITION CRANKS UP PRESSURE ON MANCHIN, DEMOCRATS TO NUKE FILIBUSTER
&#34;As a national leader, I&#39;ve seen Sunrise grow from a scrappy movement to a giant nonprofit co-opted by mega donors. Seeking only media relevance [and] proximity to Biden,&#34; O&#39;Keefe wrote on 
Twitter
. 
&#34;The letter revealed that Sunrise was losing many Black and working class members. Our Black members made a list of demands, Sunrise leadership failed to honor a single demand and tried to cover up the existence of the demands. Black members&#39; demands were a ‘threat to our DNA,’&#34; O&#39;Keefe 
continued
.
O&#39;Keefe said the conflict drove him to &#34;suicidal thoughts.&#34;
&#34;It&#39;s hard to say this, but top leadership&#39;s hostility and legal threats drove me to suicidal thoughts. These were friends I built a movement with, who turned against me for sharing truths they didn&#39;t even deny,&#34; he wrote on 
Twitter
.
&#34;I was the first Black leader of Sunrise org. I was the longest tenured Black person in a white-majority org. That alone suggests the hostility that met me. It was a hellish battle to transform white-savior, socialism-averse messaging to the radical vision we sometimes achieved,&#34; O&#39;Keefe 
wrote
.
He also accused the group of abandoning the push for the Green New Deal because of donors.
&#34;Why do these millionaires donate to us? Our spunk? No, there are BILLIONS to be made from the Green Transition. There are South American [and] African countries to pillage for lithium and other resources necessary for Green energy,&#34; he wrote on 
Twitter
.
Sunrise Movement co-founder Varshini Prakash took issue with O&#39;Keefe&#39;s account.
&#34;Alex, I love you and you’ve done incredible work for our movement, but this isn&#39;t what happened. You haven’t shown up for work in months. Multiple friends and colleagues reached out repeatedly to figure out when you were coming back, and you didn’t engage,&#34; she wrote on 
Twitter
.
&#34;In a movement powered by so many volunteers, we take really seriously the responsibility of being a paid staff member. I’m not going to say anything else publicly, but I’m always here if you decide you want to talk,&#34; she added.
Sunrise Movement made headlines in 2020 for 
protesting

The biggest donation to the Sunrise Movement the 2020 election cycle was $500,000 from The Sixteen Thirty Fund, according to

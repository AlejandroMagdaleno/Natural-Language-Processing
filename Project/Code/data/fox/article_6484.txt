New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham speaks at the third night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention.
New Mexico
 Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham&#39;s campaign paid her sexual assault accuser $150,000 in settlement payments — more than double what her 
campaign
 acknowledged earlier this year.
Reports in June said the 
Democrat&#39;s
 campaign 
paid at least $62,500
 to James Hallinan, a 2018 campaign spokesman who claimed the governor once dropped water in his lap and then grabbed his crotch at the home of state Rep. Deborah Armstrong during a meeting months before that year&#39;s election.
NEW MEXICO&#39;S DEM GOVERNOR DEFENDS $62,500 SETTLEMENT OF CROTCH-GRAB CASE: &#39;I WAS FOCUSED ON THE PANDEMIC&#39;
The governor, who has denied the allegations, said at the time that she decided to settle with Hallinan because she wanted to focus on the coronavirus pandemic.
&#34;I was focused on the pandemic, and I&#39;ll stand by that decision [to settle] every minute of every day,&#34; she told reporters on June 11.
But according to a mandatory campaign finance report filed Monday, Grisham&#39;s payout was much higher than expected. Over the past six months, her campaign paid an additional $87,500, bringing the total to $150,000.
New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver’s office has said the settlement payments are allowed because they relate to an employment dispute with a former campaign staffer, the Albuquerque Journal 
reported Monday

Grisham campaign spokeswoman Kendall Witmer said in a statement that the latest payments were part of a settlement that &#34;resolved suspect and varied claims made by Mr. Hallinan, including his search for employment and clients following his tumultuous tenure on the 2018 campaign.&#34;
&#34;The campaign reached this settlement in 2020 due to the expense of litigating business disputes and to prevent any distraction during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic,&#34; Witmer said, the Albuquerque Journal reported. &#34;Gov. Lujan Grisham will continue to work tirelessly for the people of New Mexico, delivering on record economic growth, educational investment, and tax cuts for New Mexico’s families — all while leading the state through the COVID-19 pandemic.&#34;

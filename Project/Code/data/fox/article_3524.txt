Chicago
 Mayor Lori Lightfoot furthered suspicions surrounding her office’s high turnover rate with a bizarre email she wrote to a staffer obtained by the Chicago Tribune.
In late January, Lightfoot sent an email to her then-scheduler demanding more &#34;office time,&#34; or uninterrupted time alone to work. 
&#34;I need office time everyday!&#34; Lightfoot wrote in the email, wrote 16 times in a row.  
&#34;Not just once a week or some days, everyday!&#34; she wrote in a following paragraph, 10 times in a row. 
&#34;Breaks or transition times between meetings are not office time,&#34; she wrote, seven times. 
&#34;If this doesn&#39;t change immediately, I will just start unilaterally canceling things every day,&#34; she wrote, five times.
&#34;Have I made myself clear, finally?!&#34; she wrote, 13 times.
The mayor said in a press conference Tuesday that the email was written &#34;after a lot of conversation and borne of frustration,&#34; but added that she is in a &#34;better place&#34; with her staff now. 
CHICAGO MAYOR LIGHTFOOT SUED BY DAILY CALLER AFTER NOT GRANTING INTERVIEW TO WHITE REPORTER
The 
Tribune 
reported that Lightfoot&#39;s email was written during office time and she had two more hours scheduled for later that day. 
At least a dozen staffers have left the mayor&#39;s office since late last year.
Lightfoot&#39;s abrasive management style was on display last month when it was reported that she sent her aides a photo of a ripped up document. 
&#34;As I noted, I want decisions memos no later than 48 hours before the decision is needed and I have directed (staff) to reject all efforts to bring things to me directly that skirt these rules.&#34;
&#34;I have asked nicely, now I am done,&#34; she added.

Lightfoot ignited controversy last month when it was revealed that she&#39;d taken up a policy of only granting interviews to Black or Brown reporters. The mayor said the policy was aimed at promoting diversity in the newsroom, though the policy didn&#39;t last long.

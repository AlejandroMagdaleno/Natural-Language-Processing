Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., discusses her online feud with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., over their experiences during the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 blasted freshman GOP Rep. 
Nancy Mace
 as a scam artist cut from the same cloth as former President Trump for fundraising off the New York Democrat&#39;s &#34;false&#34; experience with the 
Jan. 6 Capitol
 riot.
Ocasio-Cortez was reacting to a tweet from a CNN reporter that Mace was soliciting fundraising off her &#34;false insinuation&#34; that Ocasio-Cortez was lying about how close rioters came to their nearby offices.
&#34;Pretty horrible,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Saturday in response. &#34;Well, it’s good to know what kind of person she is early. Also good to know that Mace is cut from the same Trump cloth of dishonesty and opportunism.&#34;
Ocasio-Cortez said it&#39;s &#34;sad to see a colleague intentionally hurt other women and survivors to make a buck. Thought she’d be better.&#34;
The liberal firebrand then went on the accuse Mace of trying to &#34;swindle working people&#34; for campaign donations while still courting corporate PAC money. &#34;Peak scam artistry,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez wrote. 
Mace, R-S.C., and Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have been in a public social media spat all week after 
Mace challenged Ocasio-Cortez&#39;s recollection
 of what happened on Jan. 6 when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol.
REP. NANCY MACE: &#39;I&#39;M SICK AND TIRED&#39; OF AOC TRYING TO &#39;POLITICIZE LITERALLY EVERYTHING&#39;
After Ocasio-Cortez said in a video last month that she &#34;had a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die,&#34; Mace and others called her out by noting that rioters never entered her office building. In an interview with Fox News Radio&#39;s &#34;Fox Across America with Jimmy Failla,&#34; Mace accused her of exaggerating what happened for political gain.
Mace said her office is &#34;two doors down from @aoc and no insurrectionists stormed our hallway,&#34; Mace tweeted about their Cannon House Office Building that&#39;s connected to the Capitol.

      Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
      
Ocasio-Cortez shot back that she never said that insurrectionists were in their hallway and pointed out that Mace herself told a newspaper that she had barricaded herself in her office during the attack.
AOC FACES BACKLASH AS CRITICS POINT OUT SHE WASN&#39;T IN CAPITOL BUILDING DURING RIOT
Ocasio-Cortez, who recently revealed that she&#39;s a survivor of sexual assault, then accused Mace of minimizing the experience of &#34;survivors&#34; who may not share their stories out of shame for being trivialized. 
Mace responded that Ocasio-Cortez just needs to &#34;stop&#34; because &#34;you don’t know my story.&#34;
While a South Carolina state lawmaker, Mace revealed 
she was raped at age 16
 as she urged her colleagues to make an exception for rape survivors when they were debating a fetal heartbeat bill. 
In Mace&#39;s fundraising email to supporters, she doubled down that Ocasio-Cortez was embellishing the level of danger she faced on Jan. 6. &#34;[U]nlike AOC, I deal in facts, not fiction,&#34; the email read in soliciting donations to &#34;stand up to AOC.&#34;  
&#34;And the fact is: She was safe in her office.&#34;
REP. CHIP ROY CALLS ON AOC TO APOLOGIZE FOR TWEETING CRUZ ‘ALMOST HAD ME MURDERED’
Ocasio-Cortez has taken additional heat for tweeting that Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, &#34;almost had me murdered&#34; during the Jan. 6 
Capitol riot
. 
Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, wrote to House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 last week asking her to make Ocasio-Cortez retract her &#34;scurrilous charge.&#34;
Ocasio-Cortez hasn&#39;t backed down and on Thursday she organized a special session on the House floor for Democratic lawmakers to deliver emotional testimony on what it was like to experience the Jan. 6 Capitol siege to draw attention to &#34;
survivors of trauma

In a statement Wednesday, Donald Trump offered a tongue-in-cheek rejection of comparisons between President Biden and Jimmy Carter — saying Biden is in fact even worse.
&#34;I see that everybody is comparing Joe Biden to Jimmy Carter. It would seem to me that is very unfair to Jimmy Carter,&#34; Trump said. &#34;Jimmy mishandled crisis after crisis, but Biden has created crisis after crisis.&#34;
In recent weeks, Republicans have compared Biden to Carter, who is viewed, particularly among Republicans, as an ineffective president whose travails ultimately caused him to lose reelection to Ronald Reagan.
&#34;First there was the Biden Border Crisis (that he refuses to call a Crisis), then the Biden Economic Crisis, then the Biden Israel Crisis, and now the Biden Gas Crisis,&#34; Trump said.
&#34;Joe Biden has had the worst start of any president in United States history, and someday, they will compare future disasters to the Biden Administration—but no, Jimmy was better,&#34; he added.

The American Civil Liberties Union, in the act of celebrating the late 
Supreme Court
 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
 and fighting restrictions on 
abortion
, altered a famous Ginsburg quote to remove the word &#34;woman&#34; and replace female pronouns with the singular &#34;they.&#34; 
Conservatives and liberals remarked upon the move on Twitter, with some accusing the ACLU of &#34;literally erasing women.&#34;
&#34;The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a [person&#39;s] life, to [their] well-being and dignity… When the government controls that decision for [people], [they are] being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for [their] own choices,&#34; the ACLU posted in a photo on Twitter on the one-year anniversary of Ginsburg&#39;s death on Saturday.
&#34;With Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death, we lost a champion for abortion and gender equality. And on the anniversary of her death, the fight to protect abortion access is more urgent than ever,&#34; the ACLU argued, citing the &#34;560 abortion restrictions and bans&#34; that pro-life politicians have introduced in state legislatures across the nation.

correct quote
, from 
Ginsburg
&#39;s written responses to U.S. senators during her confirmation hearing in 1993, reads as follows: &#34;The decision whether or not to bear a child is central to a woman’s life, to her well-being and dignity. It is a decision she must make for herself. When Government controls that decision for her, she is being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices.&#34;

The ACLU removed the term &#34;woman&#34; and altered the pronouns in an attempt to cater to transgender activists, who claim that biological females who identify as male are &#34;men&#34; and therefore &#34;men&#34; can get pregnant and have abortions. 
Opponents say
 only women can get pregnant and have children. 
Greg Scott, senior vice president of communications at the pro-life Christian law firm Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), presented the tweet as evidence of &#34;The ACLU literally erasing women.&#34;
&#34;You have become the exact type of language-bending Orwellian institution you once opposed,&#34; author Colin Moriarty

Even Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel, not an outspoken opponent of transgender activism, 
remarked
 upon the absurdity of altering Ginsburg&#39;s quote. &#34;The pronoun wars are bad and silly but editing a Ginsburg quote to remove any reference to ‘women’ looks so clumsy,&#34; he tweeted.

President Joe Biden tapped former Obama administration diplomat Mark Brzezinski to be ambassador to Poland, the 
White House said
 Wednesday.
Brzezinski has previously served as the first Executive Director of the White House’s Arctic Executive Steering Committee and as the U.S. Ambassador to Sweden between 2011-2015. He later founded Brzezinski Strategies LLC and was Managing Director at Makena Capital Management, focusing his attention on &#34;the growing demand for environmentally and socially responsible investment portfolio.&#34;
Brzezinski is the brother of MSNBC Morning Joe 
co-host Mika Brzezinski
 and son of the late Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was a Polish-American diplomat and 
national security adviser
 to Jimmy Carter.
In addition to Brzezinski’s nomination, the White House also announced nominations for several foreign policy and national security roles, including ambassador nominations to Togo, Benin and Malawi.

President Biden
 seems to have a spotty memory when it comes to names and details. 
On Monday, the president appeared to forget Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s name during a White House event, calling the 
Pentagon
 chief &#34;the guy who runs that outfit over there.&#34;
&#34;And I want to thank the sec -- the, the, ah former general. I keep calling him general, but my, my -- the guy who runs that outfit over there,&#34; 
Biden said.
In December, Biden announced his pick to lead Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, but introduced him with the wrong name and title. &#34;For Secretary of Health and Education Services, I nominate Xavier Bacheria,&#34; Biden had said while reading from the teleprompter. A moment later, Biden correctly pronounced Becerra&#39;s last name.
BIDEN SEEMS TO FORGET DEFENSE SEC&#39;S NAME
Biden, 78, made history as the oldest person to ever assume the presidency. 
Last month, appearing in Houston, Biden thanked Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, whom he referred to as &#34;Shirley Jackson Lee. 
In October 2020, the then-Democratic candidate 
mispronounced the name of his running mate
, now-Vice President Kamala Harris. She says her name is pronounced &#34;comma-la,&#34; where Biden pronounced it &#34;camel-a.&#34;
On the campaign trail, Biden called former President Donald Trump &#34;Donald Hump,&#34; before making light of the slip and 
drawing a laugh from the crowd. 
&#34;If Donald Hump, Donald Trump, Freudian slip, if Donald Trump is re-elected he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation,&#34; Biden said at the New Hampshire Democratic Convention. 
GOP SENATOR, BIDEN BOTH MISPRONOUNCE &#39;KAMALA&#39;
Trump was the second-oldest person to assume the presidency, at 70 years old. He, too, had a few gaffes when it came to names, 
calling his vice president &#34;Mike Pounce&#34;
 at a House GOP retreat in Baltimore in September 2019, appearing to call GOP leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., 
&#34;Steve&#34; in January 2019
. That same year, he called former National Security Advisor 
John Bolton &#34;Mike Bolton.&#34;
The two septuagenarian presidents engaged in a war of the wits on the campaign trail, with Trump pressuring Biden to take an IQ test. 
&#34;He’s not as smart as Bernie, and he’s not as quick,&#34; Trump said in an interview with a Boston radio station in May 2020, referring to Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

&#34;Biden doesn&#39;t know, I mean, he doesn&#39;t know he&#39;s alive,&#34; Trump told WJLA at the time. 
When asked that August if he had taken a test for cognitive decline, Biden responded: &#34;No, I haven&#39;t taken a test. Why the hell would I take a test?&#34;

The Lincoln Project is unapologetic after forcing a 
Georgia
 
Republican
 state lawmaker to resign from his job at a law firm last weekend.
Georgia state Sen. John Albers worked at law firm Fisher Phillips until the Lincoln Project falsely accused him of co-sponsoring racist legislation. Albers called the Lincoln Project&#39;s tactics &#34;economic terrorism,&#34; a term the group turned back on him.
MSNBC&#39;S BRIAN WILLIAMS TOUTS AD FROM DISGRACED LINCOLN PROJECT LINKING TRUMP TO ATLANTA SPA SHOOTINGS
&#34;Economic terrorism is denying voting rights to the taxpayers who pay their salaries. Economic terrorism is making it more difficult for every Georgian to participate in democracy,&#34; Nate Nesbitt, the organization’s director of strategic partnerships, told 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution
 on Monday.
Albers said that, ironically, he had broken with his party on some voting legislation. A voting bill he did co-sponsor had bipartisan support. 
&#34;The truth is that I co-sponsored Georgia Senate Bill 62, which provides for ballots in the state of Georgia to have a watermark, seal and other security elements to include the precinct number — which are best practices,&#34; Albers said in a statement on Monday. 
Albers is one of four GOP state legislators who voted against recent legislation that would limit absentee voting and reduce weekend voting, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
THE LINCOLN PROJECT&#39;S SPECTACULAR DOWNFALL: A TIMELINE
&#34;I am proud of my work in this area. And I will not allow myself to be canceled, threatened, or intimidated based on lies about my record — particularly by a disgraced group facing well-publicized allegations of sexual harassment and financial impropriety,&#34; Albers said in a statement, which racked up tens of thousands of retweets. 
The Lincoln Project has since deleted the tweets attacking him.
&#34;GA Sen @johnalbers is CIO of Fisher Phillips (@labor_attorneys), a firm that represents Americas&#39; biggest companies. They pride themselves on diversity [and] inclusion, but Sen Albers is a co-sponsor of SB62 - a bill meant to suppress black votes [and] institue a new Jim Crow,&#34; the Lincoln Project wrote on Twitter according to 
National Review
.
The Lincoln Project tagged companies including Walmart, Wells Fargo and Starbucks in its tweets as clients of Fisher Phillips.
Albers can&#39;t detail the conversation that led to his resignation from Fisher Phillips because of a non-disclosure agreement, he told National Review.
&#34;The typical corporate America response to that was, ‘Oh my God, cut all ties. This is terrible.’ Even though those folks didn’t actually read the truth,&#34; he told National Review. &#34;I certainly wish I was still working at the firm as normal. I have the utmost respect for the people there, and I loved my job.&#34;

Fisher Phillips &#34;concluded that John Albers’ role as a state legislator is incompatible with his role as our chief information officer&#34; but is &#34;grateful for John’s many accomplishments at the firm as an excellent professional,&#34; the company said in a statement according to National Review.

The Lincoln Project, which started as an anti-Trump group, has hemorrhaged support after more than 20 men accused its co-founder John Weaver of sexual harassment in January.
While some on the left have praised its leaders for a principled stand against their former party, liberals and conservatives alike have criticized the group over its tactics and motives. Some, like Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y., have 
labeled it
 a 
scam PAC
 due to its funneling of liberal donor money to vendors controlled by the group&#39;s founders and an overall lack of return on investment.

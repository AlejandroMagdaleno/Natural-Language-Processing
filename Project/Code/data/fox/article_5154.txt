Analysts speak to Fox News about what Biden will accomplish on his first overseas trip
Retired Green Beret 
Joe Kent
 wants to bring his experience fighting America&#39;s enemies on the ground in the 
Middle East
 to 
Congress
.
Kent
 is one of several 
Republicans
 primarying Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Wash., after she voted to impeach former President 
Trump
 in 2020. Herrera Beutler&#39;s vote crystallized Kent&#39;s commitment to making an impact after personal tragedy, he told Fox News in an interview.
JEWISH INSIDER SAYS OBAMA &#39;AVOIDED&#39; QUESTIONS ON ISRAEL, MIDDLE EAST FOR WRITTEN INTERVIEW
Kent is a Gold Star husband — his wife, Navy Senior Chief Petty Officer Shannon Kent, was killed in action fighting ISIS in Syria on Jan. 16, 2019.
&#34;I had decided to get more public and in the political sphere, not necessarily running for office,&#34; Kent said. &#34;My wife was killed a month after Trump tried to get our troops out of Syria the first time.&#34;
&#34;My sights were on ‘the blob,’&#34; he said. &#34;I started speaking out in support of what President Trump was doing in the war on terror.&#34;

Kent said he would give Biden an &#34;F&#34; on Middle East policy. 
&#34;Sullivan, Blinken, John Kerry … he brought in all these guys who really staked their careers on the Iran deal, the JCPOA,&#34; Kent said, referring to national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and climate envoy John Kerry. &#34;In general, I think we continue to do the wrong things because people don’t want to admit they’re wrong … the gambler’s fallacy.&#34;
&#34;That’s essentially our national security establishment&#39;s strategy.&#34;

Kent fought in the Iraq War, then deployed to Yemen, then returned to Iraq to counter ISIS. He said he&#39;s not optimistic Biden will fully withdraw from Afghanistan as the president 
announced
 in April.
&#34;I&#39;m not sure why Biden chose Sept. 11 to pull our troops out,&#34; Kent said. &#34;That leaves our troops over there trying to do withdraw for an entire fighting season. ... What if we lose soldiers? Will they say we can’t leave again? I&#39;m very skeptical that Biden will bring this one to the end.&#34;
But Kent isn&#39;t just campaigning to end endless wars. He cites the disappearance of industries like timber and fishing, election security and &#34;draconian&#34; coronavirus lockdown measures as concerns facing voters in Washington&#39;s 3rd Congressional District. If elected, he said he&#39;d support a full immigration moratorium and push Congress to take a deeper look at what happened in the 2020 election.

Even before Herrera Beutler and nine other House Republicans separated themselves from the GOP over impeachment, she was regarded as a moderate Republican in a blue state. Kent told Fox News he&#39;s not worried that he&#39;ll be too conservative to compete in a general election.
&#34;There&#39;s a really cool, independent, populist movement out here. I&#39;m going to do everything I can to reach out to different factions,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;m not a career politician. My opponent is a career politician. She and I are the same age. … She’s been in Congress for 12 years.
&#34;For me, it was looking at the actual situation, knowing I have a commitment to my kids. I Googled ‘how do you run for Congress’ and went off to the races from there.&#34;

Kent is putting up $200,000 of his own money to fund his campaign, he said. He said he hopes more people like him decide to get involved in politics at all levels.
&#34;I would encourage anybody who is concerned with the direction this country is heading to get out there,&#34; he said. &#34;Run for something, start supporting candidates they believe in, showing up to meetings, getting their friends registered to vote. I had never considered running for Congress before. I feel like if I don’t go do this, I’m going to regret it.&#34;

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., joins &#39;The Next Revolution&#39; to discuss the president&#39;s infrastructure spending spree.
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, questioned Monday if President 
Biden
 is &#34;really in charge&#34; as the president keeps a much lower profile than his predecessors.
Cornyn questioned the president’s leadership in a Twitter thread aimed at Biden’s sparse media presence where he shared a link to a 
Politico
 article on the Biden administration&#39;s communications strategy.

Cornyn quoted a portion of the article that pointed out Biden &#34;is not doing cable news interviews&#34; and that his &#34;limited&#34; social media posts online are &#34;unimaginably conventional&#34; when they do come.
&#34;The public comments are largely scripted,&#34; the excerpt continued. &#34;Biden has opted for fewer sit down interviews with mainstream outlets and reporters.&#34;

Cornyn then said the administration&#39;s communications strategy of keeping Biden out of the limelight raises the question if the president was really at the helm of his administration.
&#34;Invites the question: is he really in charge?&#34; wrote Cornyn.
In the Politico article, White House deputy communications director Kate Berner said the administration’s communications strategy &#34;is based on innovation in the digital space, flooding the zone in regional and coalitions press, and effectively using traditional national media.&#34;
&#34;He&#39;s the president, he&#39;s got a lot on his plate. We have people fanning out every single day across different media to amplify his message,&#34; Berner continued. &#34;We don’t let his schedule be a limiting factor for us.&#34;

Berner said the administration also utilizes the Cabinet to engage with &#34;audiences that they can uniquely speak to.&#34;
The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment on Cornyn’s tweets.
Biden’s silence in the media has become a key theme in the president’s administration.

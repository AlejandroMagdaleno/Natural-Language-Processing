Photojournalist documents the reality women face in Afghanistan on &#39;America Reports&#39;
A female Afghan journalist says she has been banned from working at her television station after the Taliban takeover this past Sunday.
&#34;I didn&#39;t give up after the change of system and went to attend my office, but unluckily I was not allowed despite showing my office card,&#34; well-known Afghanistan news anchor Shabnam Dawran said while wearing a hijab in a video posted online.

She added, &#34;The male employees, those with office cards, were allowed to enter the office but I was told I could not continue my duty because the system has changed.&#34;
Dawran warned that women’s lives are &#34;under threat&#34; now that the Taliban has retaken control.

She worked primarily with widows and orphans, creating work opportunities for women and helping children develop critical job skills. She had also cultivated relationships with Afghan families.

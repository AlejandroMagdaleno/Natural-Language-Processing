House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy discusses Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&#39;s &#39;Tax the Rich&#39; dress at the Met Gala.
Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y., on Tuesday responded to criticism of her appearance at the 
Met Gala
, a costume fundraiser for the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art
 that attracts some of the world&#39;s most elite 
celebrities
.
Ocasio-Cortez was photographed at the gala on Monday evening donning a white gown with the phrase, &#34;Tax the rich,&#34; at the event where tickets start at more than $30,000. The congresswoman noted on social media that she and other New York elected officials are invited to the gala every year.
DEMOCRATS PROPOSE TOP TAX RATE OF 39.6% — HERE&#39;S WHO WOULD PAY FOR IT
&#34;I thought about the criticism I&#39;d get, but honestly I and my body have been so heavily and relentlessly policed from all corners politically since the moment I won my election that it&#39;s kind of become expected and normalized to me,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez said in response to a question on her Instagram story. &#34;The irony is that when women in power take the prospect of criticism to be to be cautious in their actions, they are then criticized for being ‘inauthentic’ and ‘too calculated.&#39;&#34;

She added that the sustainable gown created by Aurora James, whom Ocasio-Cortez described as a &#34;Black woman immigrant designer&#34; in a separate Instagram post, sparked a conversation about taxing the rich, which was her ultimate goal in wearing the design. 
REPS. AOC, CAROLYN MALONEY MISS PART OF $3.5T BUDGET RECONCILIATION MARKUP TO ATTEND MET GALA
&#34;Honestly our culture is deeply disdainful and unsupportive of women, especially women of color, and working class women (and LGBTQ/ immigrant/ etc) from the bottom up — whether it&#39;s lack of childcare support of especially reserving pillory for elected women and femme people,&#34; she continued. &#34;The more intersections one has, the deeper the disdain.&#34;

House Minority Whip rips CNN anchor for swipe at veteran amputee on &#39;The Story&#39;
House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., called on 
CNN anchor
 Jake Tapper to apologize to 
Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla.
, after the journalist made a remark about his military service.
&#34;That was a disgraceful comment,&#34; Scalise told Fox News&#39; &#34;
The Story
&#34;. &#34;Jake Tapper needs to just apologize and admit what he said was wrong. I&#39;m dear friends with Brian Mast. Brian last night went to Walter Reed Hospital and worked out with wounded warriors.
&#34;Brian lost two legs fighting for this country,&#34; Scalise added. &#34;To question his love for this country and his commitment to this country when he literally lost his his two legs and lost some fingers as a bomb squad technician fighting for our freedoms, he [Tapper] owes Brian Mast an apology.&#34;
During CNN&#39;s coverage of the House vote to impeach President Trump Wednesday, Tapper noted that Mast, a retired staff sergeant who served in Afghanistan, &#34;lost his legs fighting for democracy abroad, although I don&#39;t know about his commitment to it here in the United States.&#34;
MAST RESPONDS TO CNN&#39;S TAPPER: MY COMMITMENT TO THIS COUNTRY AND DEMOCRACY IS &#39;UNWAVERING&#39;
Mast was one of 67 House Republicans who voted in favor of an objection to Arizona&#39;s Electoral College votes Jan. 6, hours after a deadly riot at the Capitol building.
&#34;Brian Mast is the kind of person that makes this country great,&#34; Scalise concluded. &#34;He&#39;s an American hero, and Jake really should just apologize and drop it.&#34;
Scalise also responded to another CNN host, Don Lemon, who 
associated Trump voters with the Ku Klux Klan
. 
The minority whip called Lemon&#39;s remarks part of &#34;the playbook of the cancel culture, socialist left.&#34;

&#34;They want to just demonize the opposition because their ideas are very radical,&#34; Scalise said. &#34;I mean, the things they talk about, you know, taking away people&#39;s rights, the Green New Deal, raising taxes, all the things that they really stand for, they don&#39;t want to talk about publicly.
&#34;So they just want to demonize the opposition, cancel you on social media. Those are the things that are the classic tactics of the cancel culture. I think people are fed up with that. You know, let&#39;s focus on actual things that matter to families, not trying to demonize someone who disagrees with you on issues.&#34;

State Assemblywoman Aileen Gunther blasts fellow Democrat on &#39;The Story&#39; amid scandal
New York
 Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 said he would not answer questions about the investigation into accusations of sexual harassment against him during a press conference on Monday.
&#34;As you know, there&#39;s an ongoing review by the Assembly and the Attorney General&#39;s Office and I&#39;m not going to have any comment on that until the appropriate time. But let&#39;s go to questions,&#34; Cuomo said.
CUOMO ACCUSER CHARLOTTE BENNETT SAYS GOV SHOULD RESIGN: &#39;I WAS TERRIFIED&#39;
Instead, reporters asked Cuomo questions about coronavirus vaccine distribution and Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., who said he would not seek reelection after 
apologizing
 to a woman who accused him of unwanted sexual advances.

New York Attorney General Letitia James named a team of five lawyers to lead the 
investigation
 into sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo earlier in March.
Cuomo is facing multiple allegations of
 sexual harassment
 as well as a federal probe into his administration’s alleged undercounting of
 COVID-19 
deaths at state nursing homes.
An attorney for one of the women accusing Cuomo of sexual harassment is claiming that the governor is 
interfering
 with a state attorney general investigation.
Debra Katz, who represents Cuomo accuser 
Charlotte Bennett
, complained in a letter to James. It follows an 
Albany Times Union
 report that the administration was offering attorneys to meet with staffers before James&#39; office interviewed them, and even to accompany them to the interviews. Katz said she understood that the attorneys were also &#34;debriefing&#34; employees after the interviews.

&#34;This is highly improper and we object in the strongest possible terms to this obvious interference with what you have stated would be a &#39;thorough and independent&#39; investigation,&#34; Katz wrote.

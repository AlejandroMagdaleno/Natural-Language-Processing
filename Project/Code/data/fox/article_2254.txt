The 
legislation
 not only includes increased penalties for established illegal activities like gun trafficking but tighter restrictions on importing ammunition and increased policing authority.
The bill backs municipalities in creating bylaws that make the possession, storage, and transportations of handguns illegal.
Chief Firearms Officers would also have the 
authority
 to suspend or revoke gun licenses if there are &#34;reasonable grounds to suspect&#34; an individual is no longer eligible to maintain their license. This would allow authorities to investigate individuals reported by friends or family members under a new &#34;yellow flag&#34; law.

Police and border officials would additionally be able to share licensing and registration data to investigate matters involving firearms, particularly when it comes to gun smuggling along Canada’s southern border with the United States.

The legislation announced Tuesday is in addition to a ban on over 1,500 varieties of &#34;assault-style&#34; firearms Trudeau introduced in May of last year.

Minneapolis 
Mayor Jacob Frey praised 
George Floyd
 following the guilty verdict on Tuesday against former police officer Derek Chauvin for Floyd&#39;s murder.
&#34;George Floyd came to Minneapolis to better his life. But ultimately his life will have bettered our city,&#34; the Democratic mayor wrote on Twitter. &#34;The jury joined in a shared conviction that has animated Minneapolis for the last 11 months. They refused to look away and affirmed he should still be here today.&#34;
Chauvin, 45, was found guilty Tuesday of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
Chauvin&#39;s sentencing is scheduled for eight weeks from now.
DEREK CHAUVIN: GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES 
Frey’s remarks of praise didn’t land with everyone - some took issue with the mayor’s characterization of Floyd’s death as a sacrifice for the sake of the city. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered a similar sentiment in her press conference with the Congressional Black Caucus.

And now we have to make sure justice prevails in the sentencing.&#34;

Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020 after Chauvin held his knee against Floyd&#39;s neck or upper body for nine minutes and 29 seconds, as a handcuffed Floyd repeatedly said that he could not breathe. Police were called to the area on that day for a report that Floyd had used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a neighborhood convenience store, Cup Foods.

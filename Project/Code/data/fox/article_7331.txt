&#34;Why is he breaking my sign?&#34; the man holding the sign can be heard saying as protesters grab and smash it. &#34;Don’t I have the same free speech rights as you?&#34;
Once the sign is destroyed and the man is left holding just the stick it had been mounted on, the protesters start shouting &#34;He’s got a weapon!&#34;
The man is then pushed away from the scene by protesters while laughing at their accusation that he has a weapon before he then drops the stick.

&#34;I’m just here to say that jokes are funny people&#34; the man explains with his hands raised in the air. &#34;Dave Chapelle is a funny guy.&#34;
&#34;I love Dave,&#34; he added as one protester shook a rattle in his face. &#34;I don’t know why all the violence. I don’t know why all of the hate.&#34;
DAVE CHAPPELLE&#39;S NETFLIX SPECIAL SHOULD BE PULLED, ALYSSA MILANO SAYS AFTER DC PROTEST
The walkout on Wednesday at a Netflix office in Hollywood, 
California
 was organized in protest of &#34;The Closer,&#34; a recent comedy special by Dave Chappelle in which he made remarks that some viewed as offensive to the transgender community.
In &#34;The Closer,&#34; which was released earlier this month and is currently among the most-watched programs on the service in the U.S., Chappelle said &#34;gender is a fact&#34; and compared the transgender community to people who wear blackface.
Besides backlash aimed at Chappelle for his words, Netflix&#39;s co-CEO Ted Sarandos also found himself in hot water. 
In emails to Netflix staff after the special’s debut earlier this month, Sarandos defended &#34;The Closer,&#34; citing its popularity on the platform and the company’s commitment to creative freedom. He also said the company believed &#34;content on screen doesn’t directly translate to real-world harm.&#34;

Now, Sarandos says he &#34;screwed up&#34; with that statement. In an 
interview with Deadline
, the exec said, &#34;I screwed up the internal communication — and I don’t mean just mechanically,&#34; he said. &#34;I feel I should’ve made sure to recognize that a group of our employees was hurting very badly from the decision made, and I should’ve recognized upfront before going into a rationalization of anything the pain they were going through. I say that because I respect them deeply, and I love the contribution they have at Netflix. They were hurting, and I should’ve recognized that first.&#34;
Chapelle earlier this month laughed off any efforts to get him and his special canceled.
Speaking to the roughly 18,000 people in the crowd at Los Angeles&#39;s Hollywood Bowl while wearing sneakers and a suit, Chappelle touched on the fact that a number of individuals and groups are calling for &#34;The Closer&#34; to be pulled from the streamer because of alleged transphobic comments he made in it, Deadline reports.
&#34;If this is what being cancelled is about, I love it,&#34; Chappelle said to hoots and hollering from fans in attendance, per 
the outlet

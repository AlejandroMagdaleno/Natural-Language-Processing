One suspect linked to the 
assassination
 of Haitian President 
Jovenel Moïse
 had been a confidential source for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, a DEA official told Fox News.
Following Moïse&#39;s death, there had been reports that someone had yelled &#34;DEA&#34; at the time of the assassination. The official said the agency was aware of those reports, and that while the suspect in question contacted the DEA after the attack, they were not acting on the DEA&#39;s behalf.

&#34;Following the assassination of President Moïse, the suspect reached out to his contacts at the DEA. A DEA official assigned to Haiti urged the suspect to surrender to local authorities and, along with a U.S. State Department official, provided information to the Haitian government that assisted in the surrender and arrest of the suspect and one other individual.&#34;
The official did not name the suspect in question. So far, 26 former Colombian soldiers are suspected in the killing, and 23 have been arrested, along with three Haitians. Haitian National Police chief Léon Charles said five suspects are still at large and at least three have been killed.

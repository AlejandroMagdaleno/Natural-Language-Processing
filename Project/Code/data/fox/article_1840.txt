New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was booed at a Saturday concert in Central Park, video taken by Fox News&#39; Andrew Murray shows.
Widely panned outgoing New York City Mayor 
Bill de 
Blasio
 did not rule out a run for the Empire State governorship following former Gov. 
Andrew 
Cuomo&#39;s
 
disgraced departure.
During a Friday interview with MSNBC’s Morning Joe, the Big Apple mayor announced that he was considering a gubernatorial run for New York.
Host Willie Geist cited recent reports of de Blasio getting a temperature read from labor unions and asked the mayor point-blank if he is considering a run for governor.

De Blasio noted that he and Gov. Kathy Hochul &#34;respect&#34; and &#34;like&#34; one another, but that the &#34;politics&#34; in the 2022 New York gubernatorial race was &#34;a whole other world.&#34;
&#34;I believe in public service, I&#39;ve done it my whole life,&#34; de Blasio said. &#34;I want to keep working on crucial issues and causes particularly care about things like education for our kids. … So we’ll see what the future brings.&#34;
The New York City mayor was pressed by Geist on whether he was considering a run, which de Blasio didn’t take off the table.
&#34;Willie, I want to keep serving in one way or another in the future,&#34; de Blasio said. &#34;So, I&#39;m going to look at different options. Absolutely.&#34;

Chatter about a potential de Blasio gubernatorial run has picked up after Cuomo&#39;s resignation, which elevated Lt. Gov. Hochul to the governorship. 
De Blasio has already begun laying the groundwork for a potential candidacy, 
Politico
 reported Thursday. 
The mayor has been a critic of Cuomo amid the scandals, and was looking at a life out of the public eye before the New York giant fell.
De Blasio may face an uphill battle, however, even from his own city — he was recently booed at the &#34;Welcome Back NYC&#34; concert that was canceled by storms stemming from Tropical Storm Henri.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., discusses the Senate gearing up to take up the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill.
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sided with the workers at the center of a fight to unionize at an 
Amazon
 warehouse in Alabama. 
The Sunshine State senator unleashed a thunderstorm on Amazon in an op-ed 
published
 on Friday, taking the company to task for their &#34;war against working-class values&#34; and their attempt to prevent workers from unionizing.
Rubio said the company &#34;fears&#34; workers taking part in conversations about &#34;workplace conditions&#34; and accused Amazon of trying to &#34;crush the union vote&#34; of workers 
organizing
 in Bessemer, Alabama.
He went on to write that he supports &#34;the workers&#34; in their efforts to unionize in the wake of Amazon’s 
controversial
 corporate policies.
UNION ORGANIZING AMAZON ALABAMA EMPLOYEES SOUGHT BY 1,000+ COLLEAGUES IN OTHER STATES
&#34;Here&#39;s my standard: When the conflict is between working Americans and a company whose leadership has decided to wage culture war against working-class values, the choice is easy — I support the workers,&#34; wrote Rubio. &#34;And that’s why I stand with those at Amazon’s Bessemer warehouse today.&#34;
In a press release sent out Friday, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) ‒ which is leading the push for unionization ‒ applauded Rubio’s support for the Amazon warehouse workers, saying it &#34;demonstrates&#34; the role unions were created to play in labor relations.
&#34;We welcome support from all quarters. Senator Rubio&#39;s support demonstrates that the best way for working people to achieve dignity and respect in the workplace is through unionization. This should not be a partisan issue.&#34;
The senator wrote in his op-ed that &#34;Republicans have rightly understood&#34; the issues surrounding the &#34;unchecked influence of labor unions&#34; and that bad relations &#34;between labor and management are wrong&#34; for all parties involved and the nation’s economy.
AMAZON SLAMMED AFTER BANNING BOOKS IT SAYS FRAMES TRANSGENDERISM AS MENTAL ILLNESS
&#34;But the days of conservatives being taken for granted by the business community are over,&#34; wrote the senator.
Rubio called out Amazon for being &#34;allies of the left in the culture war&#34; while running back to conservatives &#34;to save them&#34; when they are &#34;threatened.&#34; He also torched Amazon as engaging in &#34;anticompetitive strategies&#34; to destroy small businesses as well as caving to &#34;Chinese censorship demands.&#34;
&#34;Amazon’s opposition to the union effort in its own backyard is also inconsistent with the progressive values it has forced on everyone else,&#34; the senator wrote. &#34;If Amazon thinks that conservatives will automatically rally to do its bidding after proving itself to be such enthusiastic culture warriors, it is sorely mistaken.&#34;
Rubio’s op-ed comes as Amazon faces a historic push for unionization.

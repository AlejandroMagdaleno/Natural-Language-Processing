Arkansas GOP senator tells &#39;The Story&#39; the world cannot trust WHO&#39;s claims; points to COVID lab leak
Senator Tom Cotton, R-Ark., slammed Delta Airlines for previously &#34;praising&#34; the Georgia election law criticized by the company&#39;s CEO. 
In a tweet posted on Thursday, Cotton accused the airline of &#34;lying&#34; after CEO Ed Bastian

 the law was &#34;based on a lie.&#34;
Bastian&#39;s statement blasting the law was a sharp departure from the company&#39;s previous statement after the bill&#39;s passage.

&#34;Over the past several weeks, Delta engaged extensively with state elected officials in both parties to express our strong view that Georgia must have a fair and secure election process, with broad voter participation and equal access to the polls,&#34; the release reads.

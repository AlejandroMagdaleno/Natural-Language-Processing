Rep. 
Dan Crenshaw
 issued a blistering response to the Taliban’s demands that the U.S. leave 
Afghanistan
 by the end of August.
&#34;The only proper response from America to these dirty savage terrorists should be: Go f*** yourself,&#34; Crenshaw, R-Texas, tweeted on Monday. 
&#34;By refusing to extend the self-imposed Aug 31st deadline, President Biden is potentially turning this disaster into something far worse. It could turn deadly for US citizens left behind. I don’t care what the Taliban says, fight for our people until the job is done,&#34; 
he added in another tweet Monday
. 
His comments came after the Taliban said they are unwilling to extend President Biden&#39;s Aug. 31 deadline of withdrawing U.S. troops from the country, and warned of &#34;consequences&#34; if the deadline is extended. 
AFGHANISTAN: WHITE HOUSE WON&#39;T COMMIT TO EXTENDING AUG. 31 DEADLINE AFTER TALIBAN THREAT
&#34;It’s a red line. President Biden announced that on ​Aug. 31 they would withdraw all their military forces. So if they extend it, that means they are extending occupation while there is no need for that,&#34; Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told Sky News. ​
&#34;If the U.S. or U.K. were to seek additional time to continue evacuations – the answer is no. Or there would be consequences,&#34; he said, adding an extension would &#34;create mistrust between us.&#34;
Biden
, meanwhile, has come under increasing pressure to extend the deadline, and is expected to make a decision on the matter Tuesday.
MCCONNELL CALLS BIDEN AFGHAN WITHDRAWAL &#39;ONE OF THE GREATEST FOREIGN POLICY DISASTERS IN US HISTORY&#39;
​​&#34;There’s discussions going on among us and the military about extending. Our hope is we will not have to extend, but there are going to be discussions, I suspect, on how far along we are in the process,&#34; 
Biden said on Sunday
. &#34;We discussed a lot with the Taliban. They’ve been cooperative in extending some of the perimeter.&#34;
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is among U.S. leaders urging the president to extend the deadline, saying Tuesday during a Fox News interview that &#34;the president needs to forget about the Aug. 31 deadline.
MCCONNELL ON US WITHDRAWAL FROM AFGHANISTAN
&#34;Extend the deadline, get outside the perimeter, make sure that every single American who wants to leave is able to get out with our assistance and our Afghan allies,&#34; McConnell said. 
&#34;The Taliban should not be allowed to tell us how long we are there to get our personnel out. That&#39;s our decision, not theirs,&#34; he added. 
Crenshaw has slammed the Biden administration&#39;s handling of Afghanistan since the country fell into the Taliban&#39;s control this month, saying on &#34;Fox &amp; Friends&#34; last week that the president&#39;s policies have been a &#34;complete disaster.&#34;

&#34;The incompetence of the Biden administration on this is really overwhelming. There need to be resignations, there need to be firings. They couldn&#39;t have done this in a worse way. We have American citizens left behind. We have people getting shot in Kabul airport at this moment. It&#39;s such a complete disaster,&#34; 
he said last Monday.

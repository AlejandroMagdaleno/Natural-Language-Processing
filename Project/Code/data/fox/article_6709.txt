The federal government is adding a new page today to its 
nuclear
 playbook. 
Because outgoing President Trump is breaking from tradition and will not be in Washington, D.C., for the 
inauguration
 of Joe Biden, the nuclear football -- the briefcase always in reach of the president that contains all the necessary materials to dial up a nuclear strike -- will have to be passed between both men through a long-distance handoff. 
One of the nuclear footballs is 
heading to Florida this morning alongside Trump
. The codes on the launch card associated with that briefcase are set to be deactivated at noon ET, as soon as Biden takes the oath of office in D.C.
BIDEN’S INAUGURATION: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
 
Simultaneously, the launch codes on a card that Biden will have in his possession at the nation’s capital -- which is dubbed the &#34;biscuit&#34; -- will go active. A second nuclear football will be on-hand for him at the inauguration, carried by a military officer in close proximity, a U.S. official told 
NBC News
. 
The aide carrying Trump’s nuclear football will then make their way back to Washington, D.C., with that briefcase, reports say.

Normally the football would be handed off in-person from the departing president to his successor at the inauguration ceremony.

But Trump’s absence Wednesday will be the first time in more than a century and a half that an outgoing president won’t attend the event.  
&#34;President Trump’s decision not to attend the inaugural just puts an unneeded complication, and some more risk, into this process,&#34; Scott Sagan, a Stanford University professor who has written about nuclear weapons, told The 
New York Times
.

No public events were on Harris’ schedule for her time in California and no local Democrats in California reported any plans to meet with Harris, 
according to the newspaper
.
Harris’ plane landed at Palm Springs International Airport just after 7 p.m. Friday PT, The Desert Sun newspaper of Palm Springs reported. A heavy law enforcement presence was in the area, 
the paper reported
.
Palm Springs Mayor Christy Gilbert Holstege tweeted out a welcome to Harris on Friday but the message offered no clues about the purpose of the vice president&#39;s visit.
Since March, when she was appointed to manage the Biden administration’s response to the U.S.-Mexico border crisis, Harris has faced steady criticism from Republicans for not visiting the border region – save for a brief trip to El Paso, Texas, in June.
But over that same time Harris has made several trips to her home state of California, including on successive weekends between the end of June and early July.
Earlier this month, Harris 
campaigned for California Gov. Gavin Newsom
 in San Leandro, near San Francisco, as Newsom was facing a recall election that he ultimately survived to remain in office.

Friday’s fast trip out West came as Democrats in Congress were trying to advance President Biden’s economic agenda, in the form of a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and a proposed $3.5 trillion so-called &#34;reconciliation&#34; bill of other spending proposals.
Harris would potentially be needed on Capitol Hill if the Senate were to deadlock on a vote, but lawmakers went another day Friday with no action on the proposals.

The G-7 is unlikely to invite 
Russia
 into its group and reconstitute the G-8 any time soon, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Friday. 
&#34;I don’t think we’re making new invitations to Russia or reiterating new invitations to Russia,&#34; Psaki told reporters aboard Air Force One. &#34;Obviously, an invitation would be done in partnership with our G-7 partners.&#34;
President Biden had his first phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week. 
Biden had his first virtual G-7 meeting Friday morning before he delivered an address to world leaders at the Munich Security Conference. 
Russia had been a member of the G-8 group until it was ousted in 2014 after annexing Crimea. Former President Trump had pushed for the country to be reinstated. Last June he called the G-7 a &#34;very outdated group of countries&#34; and said he wanted to add Russia, Australia, South Korea and India. The group currently consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom. 
BIDEN AT G-7 WILL PLEDGE $4B FOR GLOBAL VACCINES 
&#34;Russia should be in this meeting,&#34; Trump said in 2018. &#34;Whether you like it or not, and it may not be politically correct, but we have a world to run. G-7 threw Russia out. They should let Russia come back in.&#34;
It’s not yet known whether the 2021 G-7 summit will be remote or in person, Psaki said. &#34;That’s in June. I think it’s too far away at this point.&#34; 
Biden is expected to announce at the G-7 meeting a $2 billion U.S. donation to global vaccines, administration officials said, with a later donation that would raise the total to $4 billion.

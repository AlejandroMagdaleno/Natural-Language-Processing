Nevada Mayor John Lee explains why he&#39;s leaving the Democratic Party for the &#39;party of the working class.&#39;
After being elected as a Democrat, North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee said on 
&#39;Fox &amp; Friends&#39;
 Tuesday that he&#39;s switching to the Republican Party. Lee argued the Democrats&#39; &#34;elitist&#34; and &#34;socialist&#34; agenda is not one he &#34;can stand with anymore.&#34;
MAYOR JOHN LEE:
 They had an election recently for leadership, and four of the five people were card-carrying members of the Socialist Party. It&#39;s not the party that I grew up with 25 years ago in this environment, and it&#39;s not the party I can stand with anymore...
The working class, or working men and women of this country, and also the small business owners are not a part of the conversation anymore. It all has to do with the elitists and it has to do with the socialists. That is not the agenda that I have in mind for this country of the future...
When you&#39;re a pro-life Democrat, a pro-gun Democrat, and you&#39;re a very conservative person, that&#39;s not really well known in the Democratic Party anymore. And so for me to hang on as long as I did, hoping the party would change, it didn&#39;t, it got worse. So therefore, I found a new place that I can put my allegiance to and help. Once again, forget about the last eight years. It&#39;s the next four years that predict the future.

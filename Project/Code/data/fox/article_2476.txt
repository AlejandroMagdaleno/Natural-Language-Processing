Geraldo Rivera calls &#39;Black Lives Matter&#39; the most &#39;drastically&#39; failed movements on &#39;The Five&#39;
Former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton
 and far-left Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y., have backed dueling candidates for their party&#39;s nomination in the Ohio special election for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Marcia Fudge&#39;s old seat.
Clinton on Wednesday endorsed Cuyahoga County Council member Shontel Brown to represent Ohio&#39;s 11th Congressional District.
&#34;I&#39;m proud to endorse [Brown] for Congress in the OH special election,&#34; Clinton tweeted. &#34;Shontel made history as the first Black woman to chair her county Dem party, and she&#39;ll work to help her state and our country recover from COVID.&#34;
The former secretary of state also called on people to join her in supporting Brown&#39;s campaign while sharing an ActBlue link for donations.
AOC ENDORSES CONTROVERSIAL DEMOCRAT WHO COMPARED VOTING FOR BIDEN TO EATING ‘S***’
Brown is a native of Cleveland, Ohio, and &#34;began her service as a Warrensville Heights city council member in 2012,&#34; according to her 
website
. She has also received 
endorsements 
from Reps. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, and Ted Deutch, D-Fla.
&#34;Secretary Clinton has been a champion for working families for her entire career, and I am incredibly honored to receive her endorsement,&#34; Brown said in a Wednesday 
statement
 after Clinton&#39;s endorsement. &#34;As a volunteer for her campaign in 2016, I was inspired by her message to put women at the head of the table, finally.&#34;
&#34;I believe we need more leaders in office who are focused on results over rhetoric. That means a congresswoman who will fight for affordable, quality, universal health care, an end to gun violence, and jobs that can actually support a family,&#34; she continued, adding her &#34;priority&#34; in Congress &#34;will be to always put Northeast Ohio first.&#34;
Clinton&#39;s endorsement of Brown is at odds with the endorsement of former Democratic state Sen. Nina Turner by Ocasio-Cortez and other prominent progressives in the party and in Congress, 
including
 
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and other &#34;Squad&#34; members.
The competing endorsements illustrate the divide among old guard national Democrats and their new progressive contemporaries.
Ocasio-Cortez threw her hat behind Turner in March, calling the former Ohio state lawmaker a &#34;bold, unapologetic progressive who has spent her entire career advocating for the working people of Northeast Ohio.&#34;
The de facto &#34;Squad&#34; leader also said Turner is &#34;a powerful voice for progressive values and policies that will make a meaningful difference in the lives of working people across the country – like Medicare-for-All, a $15 minimum wage, and a Green New Deal.&#34;

Turner served as co-chair of Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign, and made headlines in July of last year after comparing voting for Biden to munching down on a &#34;bowl of sh--.&#34;
&#34;It’s like saying to somebody, ‘You have a bowl of s--- in front of you, and all you’ve got to do is eat half of it instead of the whole thing.’ It’s still s---,&#34; Turner

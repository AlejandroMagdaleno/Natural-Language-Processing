Russian President 
Vladimir Putin
 had laudatory words for
 President Trump,
 whom he praised as an &#34;extraordinary individual,&#34; and only a bland comment on 
President Biden
, who he called a &#34;career man&#34; in politics. 
But Putin also said he doesn’t expect any &#34;impulsed-based movements&#34; out of the plainer man, Biden. 
&#34;I believe that former U.S. president Mr. Trump is an extraordinary individual, talented individual, otherwise he would not have become U.S. President,&#34; Putin told NBC News in his first interview with a U.S. news network since 2018. &#34;He is a colorful individual. You may like him or not. And, but he didn&#39;t come from the U.S. establishment, he had not been part of big-time politics before, and some like it some don’t like it but that is a fact.&#34;
An excerpt from the interview appeared Friday on NBC&#39;s Nightly News with Lester Holt.
Biden, meanwhile, &#34;is radically different from Trump because President Biden is a career man. He has spent virtually his entire adulthood in politics,&#34; according to Putin. 
&#34;That&#39;s a different kind of person, and it is my great hope that yes, there are some advantages, some disadvantages, but there will not be any impulse-based movements, on behalf of the sitting U.S. president.&#34;
Trump has been accused by Democrats of being favorably included toward the Russian president, while Biden has been charged with being too accomodating toward Putin, despite calling him a &#34;killer.&#34;
WHITE HOUSE SAYS BIDEN-PUTIN MEETING NOT A ‘REWARD’ FOR RUSSIA
Putin said that U.S.-Russian relations have deteriorated to their &#34;lowest point in recent years.&#34; The U.S. problems with Russia include human rights abuses, including the case of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, a renewed and brutal wave of repression against dissent, and interference in U.S. elections.
Biden has labeled Putin a &#34;killer,&#34; a description NBC’s Keir Simmons brought up in the interview amid accusations that Putin has had his political adversaries killed or jailed. Putin chuckled when Simmons asked him if he was a killer. 
BIDEN, PUTIN TO MEET IN-PERSON JUNE 16 IN GENEVA, WHITE HOUSE CONFIRMS
Pressed to explain a litany of names of Putin opponents who are now dead, the Russian president shot back: &#34;I don&#39;t want to come across as being rude, but this looks like some kind of indigestion except that it&#39;s verbal indigestion. You&#39;ve mentioned many individuals who indeed suffered and perished at different points in time for various reasons, at the hands of different individuals.&#34;

Former State Department senior adviser Christian Whiton joins &#39;Fox News @ Night&#39; to discuss latest foreign policy test
Secretary of State Antony Blinken left some Mexicans baffled on Friday after displaying the Mexican flag upside down during a virtual meeting with Mexican Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard.  
Blinken posted a picture of himself seated at a desk in front of the American and Mexican flags ahead of his meeting with Ebrard. 
ANTI-ICE PROTESTERS REPLACE AMERICAN FLAG WITH MEXICAN FLAG
&#34;Great to be &#39;in&#39; Mexico! The U.S.-Mexico relationship impacts the daily lives of citizens of both countries,&#34; the 
secretary of state
 wrote on Twitter. &#34;Today I’m discussing our commitment to working with Mexico on COVID-19, promoting trade and investment, and implementing a comprehensive approach to regional migration.&#34;
Unfortunately, a detail was off with the virtual visit that left online observers baffled — the Mexican flag was flying upside-down. The head of the eagle borne on the Mexican flag is supposed to face upward — the opposite of how the flag was positioned behind Blinken. 
Mexican journalists were quick to point out the error, with some expressing confusion about why the flag was improperly displayed.

&#34;With the flag of Mexico upside-down, Secretary of State [Blinken] began a virtual visit to the country,&#34; observed journalist Ariel Moutsatsos.
&#34;Biden&#39;s secretary of state appears before the Republic of Mexico with the Mexican flag upside down,&#34; wrote Leonardo Toledo. &#34;It&#39;s a sign, monseur Blinken, a sign.&#34;
&#34;What happened there? The Secretary of State of the United States, Antony Blinken, began his &#39;virtual visit&#39; in which he spoke with Chancellor [Marcelo Ebrard],&#34; asked the publication Periódico Síntesis asked. &#34;But why is the Mexican flag upside down?&#34;
&#34;The flag of Mexico is flipped upside-down, not the other way around,&#34; wrote journalist Leo Agusto, questioning if there was a &#34;coded message&#34; in the upside-down flag.
&#34;The Dept. of State of the US turned the Mexican flag upside down for Secretary Blinken&#39;s videoconference with Chancellor Marcelo Embrard,&#34; wrote journalist Javier Garza Ramos. &#34;In navigation, raising an upside-down flag is an emergency call to signal extreme danger. There must be a reason.&#34;
When done intentionally, 
upside-down flags
 are generally used to communicate distress, protest or disrespect. 
The State Department didn&#39;t immediately return a request for comment on the upside-down flag.

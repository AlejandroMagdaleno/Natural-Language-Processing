FOX News correspondent Bryan Llenas has the latest from Brooklyn, N.Y. on &#39;Special Report&#39; 
Vice President Harris
 is taking heat for staying silent amid sexual misconduct allegations against her fellow high-profile Democrat, New York Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 — after 
crusading
 against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh following Christine Blasey Ford&#39;s accusation against him.
WHITE HOUSE TO KEEP WORKING WITH CUOMO AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC AS NY GOV BATTLES SCANDALS
&#34;Kamala ascended to VPOTUS by lauding herself as a feminist [and] champion for women [and] girls,&#34; Karoline Leavitt, communications director for Rep. Elise Stefanik, wrote on 
Twitter
. &#34;Now, as the most powerful woman in America, she remains silent on an egregious sexual assault scandal because it&#39;s against a political ally ... Feminism is a farce.&#34;
Fox News&#39; Jeanine Pirro also criticized Harris after the vice president 
ignored
 a question about Cuomo&#39;s widening sexual harassment scandal while speaking with reporters on Wednesday.
&#34;She is a fraud, a phony, a woman without a moral core,&#34; Pirro said. &#34;A woman who stands up for all women unless they are accusing a member of her political party unless it works to her political benefit. …this is certainly not the kind of woman we need running this country as President.&#34;
Lindsey Boylan, the first woman to accuse Cuomo of sexual harassment, slammed Harris and 
President Biden
 in a 
now-deleted tweet
. 
CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC ALL AVOID ON-AIR COVERAGE OF SIXTH CUOMO ACCUSER
&#34;The governor has denied all wrongdoing,&#34; Boylan wrote on Twitter. &#34;He got on his platform today and said &#39;there are many motivations of why people do things.&#39; He is calling up hate and speculation to be directed to his accusers. All harm and hate directed at the women sits squarely on @NYGovCuomo.&#34;
&#34;It also calls into question the judgment and courage of both @POTUS and @KamalaHarris,&#34; Boylan added. She later 
deleted the second tweet
.
Boylan also criticized the White House earlier in March, tweeting that the public was &#34;seeing blue trolls harass me and other survivors&#34; because Biden, Harris and other New York Democrats were &#34;supporting it with their silence.&#34; Several of the Democrats referenced in the tweet later called for Cuomo to resign.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki referenced Harris in her response to questions about Cuomo.

&#34;The New York attorney general is pursuing, of course, an independent investigation against Governor Cuomo. And that is appropriate. And the president believes that&#39;s appropriate. As does the vice president,&#34; Psaki said.

The 
White House
 expressed support on Tuesday for Tracy Stone-Manning, 
President Biden’s pick
 to lead the Bureau of Land Management, amid mounting calls among GOP lawmakers to disqualify her from consideration over her ties to a 1989 tree-spiking incident in Idaho.
&#34;Tracy Stone-Manning is a dedicated public servant who has years of experience and a proven track record of finding solutions and common ground when it comes to our public lands and waters,&#34; the White House said in a statement. &#34;She is exceptionally qualified to be the next Director of the Bureau of Land Management.&#34;
Biden nominated Stone-Manning in April to serve as director of the Bureau of Land Management, a sub-agency of the Interior Department that administers federal lands. The Senate has yet to hold a confirmation vote.
Stone-Manning has faced scrutiny over her links to environmental activists who placed spikes in trees in an effort to sabotage a timber sale in Boise, Idaho in 1989. She admitted to sending a letter to federal officials warning trees were spiked in Idaho’s Clearwater National Forest and &#34;a lot of people could get hurt&#34; if a planned timber sale proceeded. 
BIDEN NOMINEE ACCUSED OF DECEIVING SENATORS ABOUT INVESTIGATION OF ECO-TERRORIST PLOT
Stone-Manning later cooperated with federal authorities and testified against two others who were convicted.
Tree-spiking is a tactic in which metal spikes or rods are placed in tree trunks to prevent them from being cut down. It is considered a federal crime.
Protect the Public’s Trust, a watchdog group, called on the U.S. Attorney in Washington D.C. to conduct a formal investigation into whether Stone-Manning violated laws against giving false statements in her written testimony to Congress. During confirmation proceedings, Stone-Manning said she had never ‘been the target&#34; of a criminal investigation, though she acknowledged testifying before a grand jury regarding the tree-spiking incident.
Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., ranking Republican member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee, is among the GOP lawmakers who has called for Biden to withdraw Stone-Manning’s nomination.
&#34;It&#39;s clear that Ms. Stone-Manning was intentionally trying to deceive the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,&#34; Barrasso said earlier this month. &#34;She told the committee she had never been the subject of an investigation and yet complained about being investigated in the press.&#34;

Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, called for Stone-Manning to be disqualified in a floor speech on Tuesday. He noted that Bob Abbey, head of the Bureau of Land Management under former President Barack Obama, also called for her nomination to be withdrawn.
&#34;It is one thing for this administration to put forward far-left, extreme environmental nominees. It is quite another to put forward a far-left, extreme, violent environmental nominee, and that is what she is,&#34; Sullivan said.

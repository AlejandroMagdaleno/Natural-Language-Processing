Senate Minority Leader 
Mitch McConnell
 said Thursday the goal of Senate 
Republicans
 is not to stop &#34;everything&#34; 
President Biden
 proposes – just the &#34;worst.&#34;
The 
Kentucky
 Republican said his pathway back to power in the Senate is preventing some of the most far-left policies Democrats are pushing from going through.
&#34;If I become the majority leader again, it&#39;s not for stopping everything,&#34; McConnell said Thursday during an event in Covington, Ky. &#34;It&#39;s for stopping the worst.

McConnell has a storied past of pledging to scuttle Democratic presidents. McConnell famously told the National Journal in 2010 that &#34;the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President [Barack] Obama to be a one-term president.&#34; Then, as recently as May, McConnell said that &#34;

The Senate is evenly split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking 51st vote for Democrats. Despite the partisan rancor and distrust that seems to be on public display, McConnell says Democrats and Republicans are actually working together behind the scenes. 
In one example, McConnell said he&#39;s &#34;still hopeful&#34; they can reach a bipartisan deal on police reform legislation that Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., is negotiating with Democrats.

&#34;The notion that we have no collegiality, that we&#39;re all at each other&#39;s throats all the time is simply not true,&#34; McConnell said.

Former Trump officials Linda McMahon and Brooke Rollins announce the post-presidency nonprofit group on &#39;Kudlow&#39;
President Biden
 is deconstructing former 
President Trump&#39;s
 policies at breakneck speed, the president of America First Policy Institute, a group led by Trump administration alumni continuing to push his policies, told Fox News in an interview.
&#34;The speed at which the Biden administration is deconstructing the last four years takes my breath away,&#34; said Brooke Rollins, who was Trump&#39;s Domestic Policy Council head and is now AFPI&#39;s president and CEO. &#34;Whether it was on day one getting rid of the 1776 Commission on loving America and understanding America’s flaws … why on day one are you so against telling the American story?&#34;
TRUMP ALUMNI LAUNCH &#39;AMERICA FIRST&#39; NONPROFIT WITH $20M TO PROMOTE POPULIST CONSERVATISM
She also called out the Biden administration for proposing a corporate 
tax hike
 and presenting an infrastructure plan that focuses on anything but.
&#34;Eighty percent of Americans believe kids should be able to go to the school that serves them. ... Eighty percent of Americans believe America being strong on the national stage is the best way to keep us safe,&#34; Rollins said. &#34;What the left and the progressive agenda has really been sprinting toward … is an agenda that most of America does not agree with.&#34;
Rollins and a cadre of Trump-era officials Tuesday launched America First Policy Institute with a mission of boosting a populist agenda similar to Trump&#39;s.
The 35-person group has a $20 million first-year budget and a number of prominent Trump alumni at the helm. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner will serve as informal advisers.

      President-elect Donald Trump&#39;s nominee to be Administrator of the Small Business Administration is Linda McMahon.

Linda McMahon, former head of the Small Business Administration, will chair the board.
&#34;As we look at where our country’s positioned, we’ve got a world that is coming out of a global pandemic. … America still is that shining example,&#34; McMahon told Fox News in an interview. &#34;We must make sure American greatness never pales in comparison to where it has been.&#34;
The group&#39;s vice chair is Larry Kudlow, Trump’s former White House economic adviser. Kudlow hosts a 
show
 on FOX Business.
A spokesperson for AFPI didn&#39;t disclose where the $20 million funding had come from but attributed the success of early donations to its leadership.

Gen. Keith Kellogg, who served as national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence.

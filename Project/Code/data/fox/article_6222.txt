U.S. surgeon general joins &#39;Fox News Sunday&#39; with an update on COVID-19 spread and vaccine boosters. 
Pennsylvania
 Rep. Mike Doyle said he tested positive for 
coronavirus
 despite being fully vaccinated and &#34;taking the appropriate precautions.&#34;
Doyle, a Democrat, is at least the 11th member of 
Congress
 to announce a positive COVID-19 test since July amid an uptick of cases nationwide because of the highly contagious delta variant. Ten of the 11 members said they were fully vaccinated. 
3 VACCINATED US SENATORS TEST POSITIVE FOR COVID
&#34;I&#39;m feeling okay and having only mild symptoms, but I&#39;ll be quarantining in DC for a 10-day period, as the District of Columbia requires,&#34; Doyle said on Twitter.
In the months since January, no House or Senate member tested positive for coronavirus, which corresponded with the downward nationwide trend of cases and the uptick of vaccinations. But the tide turned in July in Congress with a new outbreak of cases that reflected the nationwide increase in COVID-19 transmission that is still on a steady rise.

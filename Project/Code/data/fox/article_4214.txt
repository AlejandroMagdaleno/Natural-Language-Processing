Fox News chief congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on the killing of Ofc. William Evans, on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., questioned whether the FBI and Department of Homeland Security were – or should have been – aware that the suspect who attacked Capitol Hill on Friday may have been a threat, or whether the agencies had been distracted by &#34;woke training&#34;.
Some Republicans have been 
critical
 of efforts within the military and national security community to focus on fostering a more progressive environment, which they believe the 
Biden administration has made a priority at the expense of national security

CAPITOL ATTACK SUSPECT IDENTIFIED AS LOUIS FARRAKHAN FOLLOWER, NOAH GREEN
The suspect, who has been identified as a 25-year-old man from Indiana named Noah Green, rammed a barricade at the Capitol on Friday in his car, killing Capitol Police officer William Evans and injuring a second officer. The suspect is said to have exited his vehicle with a knife and lunged at officers. The suspect, who was shot, also died on Friday.

It appeared to be a &#34;lone wolf&#34; attack, sources told Fox News, and the suspect identified himself as a follower of the Nation of Islam on Facebook.
A Facebook profile that appeared to belong to Green has since been taken down, but some posts were viewed by Fox News.
In one post Green praised 
Louis Farrakhan
 as &#34;Jesus.&#34;
Other posts included videos of Farrakhan and an image of a donation it appeared Green had made to a chapter of the Nation of Islam.
The Nation of Islam is considered a hate group, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, because of the &#34;deeply racist, antisemitic and anti-LGBT rhetoric of its leaders,&#34; including Farrakhan.
Fox News’ Michael Ruiz, Bill Mears, Paul Best and Houston Keene contributed to this report.

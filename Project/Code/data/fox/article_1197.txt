Former Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland joins &#39;The Story&#39; with analysis of Biden foreign policy
Iran
 has &#34;no leverage left&#34; over the U.S. that would enable them to pressure the Biden administration to rejoin the 2015 
nuclear deal
, former Deputy National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland told &#34;
The Story
&#34; Tuesday.
&#34;Between the sanctions that Trump put on and the low price of oil, their economy is in tatters,&#34; McFarland told host Trace Gallagher, added that the suggestion of Iranian leverage &#34;would be a joke except for the fact that nuclear weapons are involved and the security of the entire region.&#34;
In addition to economic sanctions, McFarland explained, the Trump administration had weaked Iran militarily by the January 2020 drone strike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani of the elite Quds Force.
&#34;And we&#39;re not sure who, but somebody took out 
one of their leading nuclear scientists
,&#34; she added. &#34;Iran never abided by this agreement and it was never to halt their nuclear program. It was to put it on the pause button for a decade and to be resumed.&#34;

Meanwhile, McFarland went on, the Biden administration has been given a &#34;golden opportunity&#34; by Trump to further weaken Tehran&#39;s power in the region.
&#34;The Arab countries, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, they&#39;re as upset about the prospect of Iran getting nuclear weapons as Israel is,&#34; she said. &#34;The point to be made is, we have leverage now. Whether the Biden administration approved of what Trump did or not, Trump has given them a golden opportunity. We have an Israeli-Arab peace agreement [and] we have Iran on its heels economically.&#34;
She also pointed out that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Hosseini Khamenei is an &#34;aging leader&#34; at the age of 81, and that President Hassan Rouhani, 72, is facing an election this year.

Khamenei has been in power since 1989, when he succeeded Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
&#34;The Iranian people are not blaming America for their problems. They&#39;re blaming the Mullahs,&#34; McFarland said. &#34;If the Biden administration were tough and smart ... don&#39;t fall for it again. [Iran] has to concede.&#34;
&#34;So if the Biden administration really wants success, I think they should push for a very different deal, if one at all.&#34;

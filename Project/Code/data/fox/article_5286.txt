Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 cast her first tie-breaking vote on a 
President Biden
 nominee Wednesday, advancing his pick for undersecretary of defense for policy, according to reports.
Harris has previously broken three ties on legislation in the evenly split 
Senate 
– 48 Democrats and two independents who causus with them versus 50 Republicans – but the vote that advanced 
Colin Kahl
’s nomination from the Armed Services Committee was a first for a nominee, Defense News reported.
Republicans have lined up against Kahl, a former national security adviser to Biden when he was vice president, because of his positions on the Middle East, including the Iran nuclear deal and his past social media rhetoric toward conservatives.
During former 
President Trump
’s term, Kahl

once tweeted the &#34;Republican party has debased itself at the altar of Trump.&#34;

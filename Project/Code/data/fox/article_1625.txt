John C. Inglis, the former deputy director of the 
National Security Agency
, is expected to be tapped by
 President Biden
 to head the Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency, according to a report late Sunday. 
The Washington Post 
reported 
that the post is a White House position. The paper said Inglis, who spent eight years in the position at the NSA,  is expected to be confirmed with ease. The position was created at the end of last year and will likely have to face growing security threats posed by foreign actors. 
The expected Monday announcement comes weeks after reports surfaced that suspected Russian hackers gained access to government email accounts, including one belonging to former acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, the Associated Press reported. The accounts were accessed by what is known as the 
SolarWinds
 intrusion.

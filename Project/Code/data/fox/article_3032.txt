Washington, D.C.
, Mayor Muriel Bowser is taking heat for sharing a video on &#34;preventing auto thefts&#34; amid her silence on the death of Mohammad Anwar, who died just days ago after two teen girls allegedly tasered him to steal his vehicle.
&#34;Auto theft is a crime of opportunity. Follow these steps to reduce the risk of your vehicle becoming a target. Remember the motto, #ProtectYourAuto,&#34; Bowser wrote on 
Twitter
 on Sunday.
CNN SLAMMED FOR QUESTIONABLE TWEET THAT REFERS TO MURDER AS AN ‘ACCIDENT’
&#34;Carjackings are a senseless act of violence that risk the lives of innocent individuals, and over the course of this month, we have worked to raise awareness about a troubling increase in this violent crime, related arrests and safety tips,&#34; a spokeswoman for the mayor told Fox News in a statement. &#34;Today’s prescheduled social media post was part of that effort and should not detract from the tragic death of Mohammad Anwar.  Our thoughts and prayers remain with his family and the families of those we have lost to violence.&#34;
Bowser&#39;s tweet received instantaneous backlash.
&#34;Horrible timing on this clearly scheduled tweet. And even if Mohammed Anwar wasn’t dead, carjackings are a plague in DC — there isn’t a lot you can do [with regard to] risk reduction besides simply not driving a car. This was broad daylight,&#34; journalist Natalia Antonova wrote on 
Twitter

&#34;Blame the victim huh? How about cracking down on perpetrators to deter this behavior?&#34; Twitter user Jesse Hunt

&#34;Uber Eats driver Muhammad Anwar was the victim of a carjacking by two teenage girls, who committed felony murder, in DC. He died as a result of injuries. I presume this is a scheduled tweet but it’s extremely tone deaf. Bowser’s silence is deafening,&#34; media strategist Gabriella Hoffman wrote on 
Twitter
.
Two teenage girls fought Anwar, a 66-year-old UberEats delivery driver, for control of his car, leaving him dead as he was flung from the vehicle when it wrecked. The suspects, who police say are ages 13 and 15, have been charged with murder.

The girls got into Anwar’s car around 4:30 p.m. at the Navy Yard Metro Station as he was making deliveries, Leo said.
DC TEEN GIRLS ACCUSED IN DEADLY ATTEMPTED CAR JACKING 
Anwar drove the girls to Nationals Park where he pulled his car over and a struggle ensued between them. Officials, citing police, said Anwar partially left the car and was pinned between the door and the driver’s seat as the teens allegedly put the vehicle in gear, the 
New York Post reported
. 
The car then lurched forward, causing Anwar to be fatally flung out as the car made a sharp right turn, causing it to roll over on its side and crash into two parked cars.
Officials arrived on the scene and found Anwar suffering from &#34;life-threatening injuries,&#34; police said. D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services responded to the scene and transported the victim to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead.

FOX News correspondent Mike Tobin joins &#39;America&#39;s News HQ&#39; with the latest from the nation&#39;s capital.
Washington, D.C.
 is taking a defensive posture in the lead-up to 
Inauguration Day
. Some 25,000 
National Guard
 troops have been OK&#39;d to descend on the city at the behest of the Secret Service. 
Here&#39;s what you need to know about the city&#39;s security plan: 
Every year, the Presidential Inauguration is designated a recurring National Special Security Event (NSSE). When an event is given this designation, the Secret Service becomes the lead federal agency responsible for coordinating security for the event. 
The 59th Presidential Inauguration to swear in Biden has faced unique hurdles due to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the heightened security threat after a riot on the nation&#39;s Capitol earlier this month left five people dead. 
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that the city&#39;s Metro has closed 13 of its stations as well as four major bridges. Transit lines, including trains and buses, will be suspended and wide swaths of streets in and around the Capitol will be closed off. 
Statehouses around the country -- many of which have faced sometimes violent protests -- are also facing heightened security risks.

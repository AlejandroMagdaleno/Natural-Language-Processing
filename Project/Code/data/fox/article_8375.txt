Sens. 
Chuck Grassley 
R-Iowa., and 
Tom Cotton 
R-Ark., showed off their push-up skills during a fundraising event in 
Iowa 
to call attention to the mental health of U.S. veterans.
While on stage at the event in Sioux Center Tuesday, Grassley encouraged Cotton to join him and attempt 22 push-ups, in honor of the 22 veterans who commit suicide on average each day, he said. 
&#34;So he [Cotton] and I are gonna do 22 pushups,&#34; Grassley said in front of roughly 200 Iowans.

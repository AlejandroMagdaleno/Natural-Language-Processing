The Republican National Committee slammed Facebook as &#34;an extension of the left’s woke mob&#34; after the company&#39;s oversight board upheld a ban on President Trump. 
&#34;We’ve known for multiple cycles that Facebook, Twitter and Big Tech have become an extension of the left’s woke mob. The First Amendment and our freedom of speech is a right granted to all Americans from the Constitution, not from Facebook’s ‘Oversight Board,’&#34; RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to Fox News. 
&#34;If Big Tech can ban a former President, what’s to stop them from silencing the American people next?&#34; she added. 
Facebook’s Oversight Board upheld a ban on the former president instituted after the Jan.6 Capitol riot but said it was &#34;not appropriate&#34; for Facebook to impose the &#34;indeterminate and standardless penalty of indefinite suspension.&#34; 
The board gave Facebook six months to review the &#34;arbitrary&#34; indefinite ban, saying in a tweet that the company &#34;violated its own rules.&#34;
&#34;Facebook cannot make up the rules as it goes, and anyone concerned about its power should be concerned about allowing this,&#34; the board said in a 
statement
. &#34;Having clear rules that apply to all users and Facebook is essential for ensuring the company treats users fairly.&#34;
Facebook, responding to the board&#39;s decision Wednesday, said it believes its move to ban Trump in January was &#34;necessary and right,&#34; and are &#34;pleased the board has recognized that the unprecedented circumstances justified the exceptional measure we took.&#34; 
Facebook said it will &#34;now consider the board&#39;s decision and determine an action that is clear and proportionate.&#34;
&#34;In the meantime, Mr. Trump&#39;s accounts remain suspended,&#34; Facebook said.

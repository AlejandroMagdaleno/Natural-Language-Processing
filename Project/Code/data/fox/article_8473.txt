FOX News media analyst and &#39;Media Buzz&#39; host Howard Kurtz has the details on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Reps. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y. and 
Rashida Tlaib
, D-Mich., have been selected to serve on the House’s Financial Services Committee, House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi’s
 office announced Thursday.
Both &#34;Squad&#34; members were already chosen earlier this month to serve on the 
House Oversight Committee
 as well.
Fellow &#34;Squad&#34; member Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., was named to the Oversight and Reform Committee. 
&#34;In the election, the American people elected a Democratic House Majority that not only will ensure that our nation recovers from this historic pandemic and economic crisis, but will Build Back Better,&#34; Pelosi said in a 
statement 
announcing the dozens of assignments to committees such as Armed Services, Education and Labor, Foreign Affairs and the Veterans Affairs Committee.
SPEAKER PELOSI NAMES REP. SWALWELL TO RETURN TO THE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE DESPITE SPY TIES 
She said the &#34;outstanding Members&#34; would be &#34;relentless in leading Democrats’ work to combat disparities in our economy and country and to advance justice and progress For The People.&#34;
Pelosi, 80, has been accused by Ocasio-Cortez, 31, and others of not bringing the younger members into leadership positions. 
Last month, the New York congresswoman told The Intercept, &#34;I think one of the things that I have struggled with — I think that a lot of people struggle with — is [that] the internal dynamics of the House has made it such that there’s very little option for succession if you will.&#34;
PELOSI ANNOUNCES NEW &#39;SQUAD&#39; ASSIGNMENTS TOHOUSE COMMITTEES
She said she thought it was time for new and younger leadership to take over for Pelosi and incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, 70. 
&#34;Why does AOC complain that you have not been grooming younger people for leadership?&#34; &#34;60 Minutes&#34; reporter 
Lesley Stahl asked the speaker
 in an interview that aired last Sunday. 
Pelosi responded, &#34;I don’t know. You’ll have to ask her — because we are.&#34;
After Stahl called Pelosi&#39;s answer &#34;dismissive&#34; of the congresswoman, Pelosi that wasn&#39;t her intention, adding that Ocasio-Cortez is &#34;very effective, as are others — many other members in our caucus that the press doesn’t pay attention to. But they are there and they are building support for what comes next.&#34;
PELOSI GETS &#39;SHARP&#39; WHEN ASKED ABOUT AOC DURING &#39;60 MINUTES&#39; INTERVIEW
Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Californian who Republicans have asked to step down from the House Intelligence Committee over his past ties to a suspected Chinese spy, 
will also return to the Homeland Security Committee
.
He previously served on the Homeland Security Committee during his first term in Congress, from 2012 to 2014, which was before the FBI had briefed him on alleged Communist spy Fang Fang’s activities.

After that, he cut ties. He has not been accused of wrongdoing, but critics have demanded he step down or be removed from the Intelligence Committee as part of standard counter-intelligence risk-management practices.
Former House impeachment manager Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., will join Swalwell on the Homeland Security Committee.

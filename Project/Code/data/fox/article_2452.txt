Former CIA officer Bryan Dean Wright on the agency’s recruitment ad getting ridiculed for woke propaganda.
Republican
 lawmakers torched the 
CIA’s
 new recruitment ad on Tuesday, with one calling the video message posted by the nation’s highest intelligence agency &#34;embarrassment.&#34;
A number of Republican lawmakers did not hold back when taking aim at the CIA for their new recruitment ad, blasting the agency for their &#34;woke&#34; message that included a Latina agent that described herself as &#34;cisgender&#34; and &#34;intersectional.&#34;
In a statement to Fox News, Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said that the CIA needs to focus on doing its job instead of pandering to the &#34;divisive rhetoric&#34; of the left.
&#34;The CIA needs to be focused on intelligence gathering and recruiting the best and brightest,&#34; Blackburn said. &#34;We can’t afford to risk our national security and waste resources to pander to the Left’s divisive rhetoric.&#34;
‘WOKE’ CIA RECRUITMENT VIDEO RILES UP SOCIAL MEDIA: ‘TRULY EMBARRASSING FOR OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY’
Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas pondered on Twitter Monday if the ad would &#34;scare&#34; America&#39;s foreign adversaries like Kim Jong Un, and said the agency has become a far cry from one of its most famous fictional agents.
&#34;If you&#39;re a Chinese communist, or an Iranian Mullah, or Kim Jong Un...would this scare you?&#34; Cruz wrote. &#34;We&#39;ve come a long way from Jason Bourne.&#34;
Wisconsin&#39;s Sen. Ron Johnson didn&#39;t mince words, torching President Biden for &#34;diverting CIA resources&#34; to support radicals on the left &#34;in their woke culture war&#34; in a Tuesday statement to Fox News.
&#34;Instead of focusing on the real international threats from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, or the crisis he created on the Southern border – President Biden is diverting CIA resources to support radical leftists in their woke culture war that is tearing America apart,&#34; Johnson said.

House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, told Fox News on Tuesday that the CIA&#39;s recruitment should find patriotic Americans to serve the nation such as the late CIA officer Mike Spann, the first American killed in action during the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.
&#34;The function of the CIA is such that their recruitment should reach out to the selfless, courageous, talented, patriotic American men and women,&#34; Wenstrup said. &#34;I believe the values and ethos displayed by Mike Spann are what our nation needs for the unique work of the CIA.&#34;
&#34;Mike Spann, a Marine then CIA agent, wrote on his CIA application, &#39;I believe in the meaning of honor and integrity. I am an action person who feels personally responsible for making any changes in this world that are in my power [...] because if I don&#39;t, no one else will,&#39;&#34; Wenstrup added.
Freshman Rep. Pat Fallon of Texas called the ad an &#34;embarrassment&#34; and quipped that the CIA is prepared to &#34;fight back&#34; against the Chinese Communist Party if they plan on assaulting America &#34;with misgendered pronouns and microaggressions.&#34;
&#34;If China plans on attacking the United States with misgendered pronouns and microaggressions, the CIA will be ready to fight back,&#34; Fallon told Fox News on Tuesday. &#34;Otherwise we&#39;d better start brushing up on our Mandarin. What an embarrassment.&#34;
Arizona&#39;s Rep. Andy Biggs blasted the video as showing a major shift in the CIA’s motto in a tweet published Monday.

The officer in the ad tells viewers that while she used to suffer from &#34;&#39;imposter syndrome,&#34; she has embraced herself &#34;unapologetically&#34; because she refuses to internalize &#34;misguided patriarchal ideas of what a woman can or should be.&#34;
Former CIA officer Bryan Dean Wright tweeted on Monday that the CIA &#34;used to be about&#34; serving the country but the agency is now &#34;about demanding — and getting — accommodation to fix an emotional wound or advance a personal agenda.&#34;
&#34;America is less safe with this new CIA, and dangerously more political,&#34; he warned.

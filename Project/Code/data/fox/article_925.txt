FOX News White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on &#39;Special Report&#39;
White House
 COVID-19 adviser Andy Slavitt appeared stumped Wednesday when asked on MSNBC to explain 
California
 and 
Florida’s
 similar COVID-19 trends, despite having wildly different responses to the 
pandemic
. 
Slavitt said the virus was still very unpredictable and &#34;a little bit beyond our explanation.&#34; 
&#34;What we do know is that the more careful people are, the more they mask and social distance. And the quicker we vaccinate, the quicker it goes away and the less it spreads,&#34; Slavitt said, noting that variants make it harder to predict. 
&#34;As we all have learned … this is a virus that continues to surprise us. It’s very hard to predict. And all around the country, we’ve got to continue to do a better job, and I think we are, but we’re done yet.&#34;  
California has emerged as one of the strictest states in the nation, with 
Gov. Gavin Newsom
, a Democrat, 
shutting down businesses
 and 
schools
. His administration said it was implementing these measures based on counties’ ICU capacity.
Meanwhile, Florida 
Gov. Ron DeSantis
, a Republican, has taken an entirely different approach. Though he took similar measures to Newsom early on in the pandemic, he eventually lifted statewide restrictions on the economy and prohibited law enforcement from fining people.

Despite their differences in policies, either state has shown similar COVID-19 trends – even accounting for the population difference.

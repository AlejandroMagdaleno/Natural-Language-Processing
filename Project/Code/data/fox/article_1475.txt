FOX News correspondent Bryan Llenas has the latest from Brooklyn, N.Y. on &#39;Special Report&#39; 
President Biden
 said New York Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 should resign if an investigation supports the sexual misconduct claims made by his accusers.
&#34;If the investigation confirms the claims of the women, should he resign?&#34; ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos asked Tuesday. More of the interview was scheduled to air on the network Wednesday morning. 
&#34;Yes,&#34; Biden responded. &#34;I think he&#39;ll probably end up being prosecuted, too.&#34;
&#34;How about right now?&#34; Stephanopoulos pressed, citing the growing calls for Cuomo&#39;s resignation from prominent 
New York
 Democrats such as U.S. Sens. 
Chuck Schumer
 and 
Kirsten Gillibrand
, who have argued Cuomo cannot be &#34;an effective governor&#34; amid the scandals.
&#34;That&#39;s a judgment for them to make,&#34; Biden responded.

&#34;A woman should be presumed to be telling the truth and should not be scapegoated and become victimized by her coming forward,&#34; Biden continued. &#34;But there should be an investigation to determine whether what she says is true. That&#39;s what&#39;s going on now.&#34;
&#34;And you&#39;ve been very clear, if the investigation confirms the claims, he&#39;s gone,&#34; Stephanopoulos followed. 
&#34;That&#39;s what I think happens,&#34; Biden responded. &#34;And, by the way, it may very well be that there could be a criminal prosecution that is attached to it. ... I&#39;ve started with the presumption [that] it takes a lot of courage for a woman to come forward. Some are not ... anyway. It takes a lot of courage to come forward and so the presumption is [that] it should be taken seriously and it should be investigated. And that&#39;s what&#39;s underway now.&#34; 
Seven women have come forward in recent weeks accusing the embattled Democrat of unwanted touching, inappropriate comments, forcibly kissing an aide on the lips, and groping a staffer at the governor&#39;s mansion.

Cuomo, however, remains defiant and is resisting calls to resign, blaming 
&#34;cancel culture&#34;
 while calling for the investigation to continue. 
Meanwhile, his nursing home scandal also continues to grow as his administration is being accused of covering up the state&#39;s 
COVID
 nursing home deaths following his controversial policy ordering assisted living facilities to accept COVID-positive patients.

Saying that his administration will &#34;spare no expense,&#34; 
President Biden
 on Monday announced that he is doubling funding for the
 
Federal Emergency Management Agency&#39;s (
FEMA
) 
extreme weather
 preparations.
&#34;FEMA’s going to make $1 billion available to the states, territories, tribes and rural communities&#34; through the Building, Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, Biden said after a briefing at FEMA’s headquarters.
NOAA FORECASTERS PREDICT ANOTHER BUSY ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON
&#34;That&#39;s double the funding available from last year, and it&#39;s going to help communities, including those too often overlooked,&#34; the president emphasized.

The increased funding comes after a surge in major 
hurricanes
 during 2020, with a record-breaking 30 named storms and a dozen hurricanes or tropical storms that made landfall in the U.S. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is projecting another heavier than average storm season for 2021, with 13-20 named storms likely, 6-10 becoming hurricanes, and 3-5 reaching major hurricane status.

Biden noted that last year the nation &#34;faced the most named storms on record – 7 out of the 30 named storms alone claimed 86 lives and caused more than $40 billion in damage.&#34; 
And he warned that &#34;this year NOAA is focusing on another severe season.&#34;
&#34;We’re going to spare no expense, no effort, to keep Americans safe and respond to crises when they arise, and they certainly will,&#34; the president highlighted. &#34;Now it’s time to get ready for the busiest time of the year for disasters in America – hurricane season in the South and East and the 
fire 
season 
out West.&#34;

Biden stressed that his announcement had nothing to do with partisan politics. &#34;It’s about not about red states and blue states. You all know that. It&#39;s about having people&#39;s backs in the toughest moments that they face, ready with food, water, blankets, shelters and more,&#34; the president said.

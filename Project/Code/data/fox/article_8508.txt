The State Department
 confirmed a Qatar Airways charter flight left

We will continue to help U.S. citizens and Afghans affiliated with the U.S. government to depart Afghanistan. The international community welcomes the Taliban’s cooperation on these flights, and we will continue our engagement so that U.S. citizens and Afghans enjoy full freedom of movement.&#34;

special envoy
 Zalmai Khalilzad confirmed that a Qatar Airlines chartered plane landed in Qatar carrying about 170 civilians. Khalilzad said he was &#34;grateful that more Americans were able to leave [Friday] on a Qatar Airways flight.&#34;
&#34;As President Biden said, there is no deadline for Americans remaining in Afghanistan,&#34; the envoy added. &#34;We remain committed to get them out if they want to come home.&#34;
According to

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sept. 8 that the Taliban must allow planes transporting Americans and allies to depart the Kabul airport, or else face consequences.
&#34;Those flights need to be able to leave, and the United States government, State Department – we are doing everything we can to help make that happen,&#34; Blinken said. &#34;Those flights need to move. I pointed out some of the complications that are there, but those flights need to move.&#34;

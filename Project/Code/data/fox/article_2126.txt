Police say the murder was a hit ordered on behalf of the gang by a 47-year-old murder convict serving a life sentence.
In April, Lopez’s family was

 $4.9 million from the city of Fresno as a result of a police shooting that killed her 16-year-old son Isiah Murrietta-Golding after he fled from law enforcement. 
Investigators say Lopez purchased guns for her 14-year-old son who was part of the gang, and the son then shared or sold the guns to other members of the gang.

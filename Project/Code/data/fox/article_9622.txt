A Loudoun County, Virginia, high school dished out $24,000 to a racial equity firm that had already collected nearly half a million dollars from the county for providing race programs, documents show.
According to a 
contract
 provided to Fox News, the Sterling, Va.-based Park View High School paid cash to The Equity Collaborative, a North Carolina-based consulting firm, for six virtual equity training sessions for educators between Feb. 1 and April 12.
Wayde Byard, the public information officer for Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS), did not say what services the group provided but said Title I Funds covered the contract. Such funds must go 
towards
 helping low-income students meet state academic standards. 
The contract appears to be the first between a Virginia school and the Equity Collaborative. However, it comes on the heels of the county 
pushing $500,000
 in funds to the group for programs designed to counter systematic bias and oppression.
Loudoun County has further laid out plans to allocate more than 
$6 million
 for &#34;equity&#34; and &#34;equity training&#34; in its 2022 fiscal year budget, although it is unclear what the cash will cover. Byard 
told
 Fox News that &#34;the majority - $5.49 million or 90% - is to provide equitable access to instruction and resources for our 85,867 projected students.&#34;

The latest revelation helps shed light on the inner workings of a county that has captured national attention as a prominent battlefield over critical race theory (CRT). 
Although LCPS has denied teaching CRT, an invoice shows the Equity Collaborative explicitly charging the school system for training related to &#34;critical race theory.&#34;
Defenders generally argue that CRT-type training helps enhance dominant groups&#39; understanding and empathy of what the oppressed experience on a regular basis. These types of trainings have also been promoted as ways to &#34;dismantle&#34; or weaken alleged structures imposing burdens through bias and discrimination.

&#34;In explaining LCPS&#39; equity priorities, it might be helpful to state what they are not. They are not an effort to indoctrinate students and staff into a particular philosophy or theory. What they are is an effort to provide a welcoming, inclusive, affirming environment for all students,&#34; 
said
 then-Interim Superintendent Scott A. Ziegler.
&#34;LCPS&#39; work on equity is a journey that requires the commitment of staff at all levels. I feel the staff&#39;s work, which has been sustained, honest and undertaken in good faith, has been misrepresented recently by some members of the public,&#34; he added.

Brad Raffensperger hits back at &#39;false&#39; election law claims on &#39;Your World&#39;
Georgia
 Democratic Reps. Lucy McBath and Carolyn Bourdeaux, who represent the 
Atlanta
 suburbs, have been silent after the 
MLB
 pulled this year’s All-Star Game out of Atlanta in protest of Georgia&#39;s new voting legislation.
&#34;It&#39;s shocking that these Congresswomen have been silent on a woke mob stealing $100 million from their city and their constituents. Lucy McBath and Carolyn Bourdeaux should condemn Joe Biden, Stacey Abrams, and any other politician who lied about this bill,&#34; National Republican Congressional Committee spokeswoman Camille Gallo told Fox News.

Fox News&#39; inquiries to McBath and Bourdeaux were not returned at the time of publication. McBath represents Georgia&#39;s 6th Congressional District in the northern suburbs of Atlanta, while Bourdeaux represents the neighboring 7th Congressional District.
Meanwhile, Georgia businesses are 
speaking out
 against the MLB&#39;s decision to punish the state, saying the league’s decision to move the All-Star Game to Colorado was &#34;crushing.&#34;

Tudy Rodney of Rodney’s Jamaican Soul Food in Atlanta 
told
 FOX 5 Atlanta&#39;s &#34;Good Day Atlanta&#34; on Monday that the move by the MLB was &#34;crushing.&#34; Rodney’s restaurant is near the Braves&#39; ballpark.
&#34;We&#39;re trying to build back from a pandemic that happened last year, and something like this is not good for business,&#34; Rodney said. &#34;Rodney’s will suffer.&#34;
PSAKI ON MOVING MLB ALL-STAR GAME TO COLORADO: GEORGIA LEGISLATION WAS ‘BUILT ON A LIE’
Job Creators Network CEO 
Alfredo Ortiz
 told &#34;Fox and Friends&#34; on Monday that the MLB’s move leaves a pit in his stomach.
&#34;They&#39;re barely making it out of the COVID-19 pandemic, and now they’re fac[ing] under the Biden administration potentially higher taxes, higher minimum wage, more red tape and regulations, and now this,&#34; Ortiz said.

Ortiz said that the estimated cost on the state of pulling the All-Star Game from Atlanta was &#34;upwards of $100 million.&#34;
&#34;A lot of these were minority-owned businesses that were really looking forward [to] and desperately needed this kind of revenue in stream,&#34; Ortiz said. &#34;And all because, quite frankly, there was a misinterpretation or misunderstanding or, quite frankly, just an outright lie of the law that was passed here in Georgia on voting rights.&#34;

House Minority Leader reacts to president&#39;s address to joint session of Congress on &#39;Hannity&#39;
Without speaking a word, Rep. Lauren Boebert appeared to tell 
President Biden
 and 
Vice President Kamala Harris
 on Wednesday night what she was thinking about their handling of the migrant crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.
While seated in the House chamber of the Capitol for Biden’s joint address to Congress, Boebert unfurled a Mylar blanket -- similar to those seen used by migrants in shelter facilities along the border.
&#39;UNCLE TIM&#39; TRENDS ON TWITTER AFTER SENATOR&#39;S REBUTTAL
Boebert confirmed to Fox News that the use of the blanket was intentional.
&#34;Biden refused to bring attention to the crisis he created at the southern border,&#34; Boebert told Fox News on Thursday. &#34;So I did.&#34;
The connection between Boebert’s blanket and the migrant shelters seemed lost on some members of the media.
&#34;@laurenboebert opened a Mylar blanket on the floor, crinkling and making noise as it opened,&#34; Kasie Hunt of NBC News wrote on Twitter. &#34;It was warmer than usual in the chamber when this speech started, but they have definitely cranked the AC since.&#34;
 
&#34;Rep Lauren Boebert just took out a Mylar blanket, rustling it open and placing it on her lap,&#34; wrote Mary Bruce of ABC News. &#34;McCarthy whipped his head around to see what the noise was and what was going on.&#34;
Boebert, a Colorado Republican, was also spotted using her phone during the speech, as she apparently posted tweets as the president spoke.
&#34;Will Biden talk about the cartels that are destroying America? And I’m not talking about the radical left in attendance tonight,&#34; Boebert wrote in one post.
 
&#34;Biden still hasn’t mentioned the crisis he created at our southern border,&#34; she added in a second tweet.
 
&#34;The border is a war zone,&#34; she wrote in another.
 
&#34;Biden’s solution to illegal immigration is amnesty and open borders,&#34; she added.
In his speech, Biden called for illegal immigrants to be placed on a path to U.S. citizenship.
&#34;Immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history,&#34; Biden said. &#34;The country supports immigration reform. We should act.&#34;

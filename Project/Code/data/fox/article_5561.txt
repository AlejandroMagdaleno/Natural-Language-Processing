FOX News contributor tells &#39;America Reports&#39; the claim &#39;devalues true racism&#39;
Civil rights attorney 
Leo Terrell
 joined 
&#34;America Reports&#34;
 and slammed the idea a tree can be racist on Monday, calling the notion &#34;embarrassing,&#34; after a 
Portland high school delayed
 voting to change its mascot over concerns about its potential ties to lynching.
TERRELL: This subject bothers me a lot. I&#39;ve been a civil rights attorney for 30 years. I taught U.S. History for seven years. I&#39;ve never had a client complain that a tree is racist. I&#39;ve never had a case that deals with the tree being racist. It devalues true racism in this country. When I taught U.S. History, this was never a sticking point. I never heard of a state or local municipality complaining about her tree having a historical negative, racist view because of lynching. This is the viewpoint of some person who uses social platforms for 15 minutes of fame. I want to see the victims were actually complaining about a tree being associated with lynching. It does not exist. It has to be brought out and challenged. I am challenging whoever raised the issue, show us the facts of the data.
The idea of a tree having some participation in racist activity, there is no data, no analogy, and no historical analytical approach to such a conclusion. It&#39;s insulting, as a civil rights attorney I never came about this, never been approached by this. It diminishes and devalues what actually happened in the 30s and 40s and 50s. When we’re talking about a tree, a tree having some type of causation affect with lynching. It does not exist. I wish you would have the person who raised this issue on the show with me so we can tell the American public this is nothing more than somebody&#39;s 15 minutes of fame. It&#39;s embarrassing.
Let me tell you right now it&#39;s never going to end because unfortunately it&#39;s a winning playbook from the extreme left, those who want to play the race card. When you accuse someone of being a racist or having racial activities, you freeze them. You scare them. You intimidate them. I&#39;m not intimidated. The fact that I&#39;m a civil rights attorney, I know this argument of racism, systemic discrimination, Joe Biden talking about Jim Crow, it does not exist. But it intimidates people and that&#39;s why it will continue.

GAYNOR:
 &#34;You know, there is some chatter out on the Internet about those that seek to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power on the 20th, and the FBI and Secret Service and all our partners, the intel community, are looking into that to make sure that, again, no stone [is] unturned when it comes to somebody&#39;s thinking about threatening the peaceful transfer of power.&#34;

&#34;After the 6th of January, everyone is [on] heightened alert. What happened on the 6th is absolutely uncalled for. You know, it&#39;s horrible in our history. And to make sure that, again, we have a peaceful transfer of power, we want to make sure that, you know, we don&#39;t wish we didn&#39;t go far enough. [We have an] impressive array of men and women out there ready to make sure that that transfer happens peacefully.&#34;

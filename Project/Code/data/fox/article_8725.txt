Sen. Ted Cruz rips &#39;irresponsible&#39; NBA player on &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39; 
LeBron James
 tweeting &#34;you&#39;re next&#34; at 
one of the officers
 who responded to the fatal shooting of 16-year-old Ma&#39;Khia Bryant in Columbus, Ohio is part of a &#34;pattern&#34; of behavior by left-wingers, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told &#34;
Fox News Primetime
&#34; Wednesday.
&#34;The left consistently goes after, attacks and demonizes police officers ... often before the facts are known, often before there is any evidence of what happened,&#34; Cruz told host Ben Domenech, &#34;but their immediate reaction, whenever there is an incident, is that police officers is in the wrong.
&#34;And in this instance, &#39;you&#39;re next&#39; could certainly be interpreted by some, even, as a call for violence. I think it was a grossly irresponsible message for LeBron James to send out.&#34;
Cruz noted that James, 36, essentially ignored the fact that Columbus police released body camera footage that showed Bryant attacking another female with a knife.
LEBRON JAMES ADDRESSES NOW-DELETED TWEET: &#39;I&#39;M SO DAMN TIRED OF SEEING BLACK PEOPLE KILLED BY POLICE&#39;
&#34;By any measure, it was a volatile situation,&#34; the senator said. &#34;The woman who was killed was wielding a knife, was violent, appeared to be threatening the [lives] of others. It may well be, on an investigation, that this police officer saved the life of a potential victim of a knife attack and we shouldn&#39;t jump to conclusions.&#34;
The Texas lawmaker added that the Ohio authorities are right to invstigate the shooting further, but that fact doesn&#39;t absolve the rush to judgement from high-profile people like James 
&#34;The facts should be determined, but the left doesn&#39;t care about the facts, they care about demonizing and attacking law enforcement and I think it&#39;s wrong,&#34; he said.
James later deleted the &#34;you&#39;re next&#34; tweet and replaced it with a brief thread that attempted to explain his feelings.
&#34;I’m so damn tired of seeing Black people killed by police. I took the tweet down because its being used to create more hate,&#34; James said. &#34;[This is] about the entire system and they always use our words to create more racism.&#34;

James&#39; tweet followed responses from people like Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who wrote that &#34;while the verdict was being read in the Derek Chauvin trial, Columbus police shot and killed a sixteen-year-old girl. Her name was Ma’Khia Bryant. She should be alive right now.&#34;
Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., tweeted that &#34;Black girls deserve to grow up and become women.&#34;

Some on the left are re-upping their calls for 
Supreme Court
 Justice Stephen Breyer to retire from the bench Monday after Senate Minority Leader 
Mitch McConnell
 said he would block a nominee from 
President Biden
 in 2024 if Republicans are in the Senate majority. 
McConnell, R-Ky., made the comments on the Hugh Hewitt radio show, sparking outrage from many liberals who recoiled when McConnell did the same thing in 2016 to former President Obama&#39;s Supreme Court nominee, then-Judge Merrick Garland. 
&#34;Breyer needs to retire,&#34; liberal activist Charlotte Clymer tweeted. &#34;Greatness in public service has to also mean knowing when it’s time to pass the baton, and it’s time.&#34;
MCCONNELL SAYS HE&#39;LL BLOCK BIDEN SUPREME COURT NOMINEE IN 2024 IF GOP CONTROLS SENATE
&#34;Certainly feels good to yell online about this,&#34; former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau added, &#34;but the only audience that really matters is Stephen Breyer, @JoeManchinWV, @kyrstensinema, and a handful of other Senate Dems who are hiding behind them.&#34;
Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., who has been vocal in supporting packing the Supreme Court and in calling for Breyer to step down, also weighed in on McConnell&#39;s comment. 
&#34;When I became the first person in Congress to call for Justice Breyer to retire now, while President Biden can still appoint a successor, some people asked whether it was necessary,&#34; Jones said. &#34;Yes. Yes, it is.&#34;
Many liberals have been calling on Breyer to leave the bench for months. Those calls became significantly louder after Breyer gave a lecture at Harvard Law School in which he said that packing the Supreme Court, a policy supported by many Democrats, might be a bad idea that could harm the court&#39;s legitimacy. 
&#34;Structural alteration motivated by the perception of political influence can only feed that latter perception, further eroding that trust. There is no shortcut,&#34; Breyer said of court-packing and the court&#39;s legitimacy. 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., joined those saying Breyer should step down in a Sunday interview on CNN.
&#34;You know, I – it&#39;s something that I’d think about but I, I would probably lean towards yes. But yes, you&#39;re asking me this question so I&#39;ve just, I would give more thought to it, but, but I&#39;m inclined to say yes,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez said when asked about Breyer in an interview that came before McConnell&#39;s latest comments. 
AOC AGREES WITH CALLS FOR BREYER TO STEP DOWN FROM SUPREME COURT
&#34;I think in the middle of a presidential election, if you have a Senate of the opposite party of the president, you have to go back to the 1880s to find the last time a vacancy was filled,&#34; McConnell told Hewitt Monday when asked about a potential 2024 election year vacancy.  
&#34;So I think it’s highly unlikely. In fact, no, I don’t think either party if it controlled, if it were different from the president, would confirm a Supreme Court nominee in the middle of an election,&#34; McConnell added. &#34;What was different in 2020 was we were of the same party as the president.&#34;

Indeed, McConnell said as early as Feb. 22, 2016, that &#34;the Senate has not filled a vacancy arising in an election year when there was divided government since 1888, almost 130 years ago.&#34; For that reason, McConnell says, Republicans were being consistent when they confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett after stonewalling now-Attorney General Garland&#39;s Supreme Court nomination in 2016. 
But Democrats accused Republicans of naked hypocrisy for confirming a Supreme Court justice during an election year in 2020 after declining to do so in 2016. 
&#34;Let the record show that tonight, the Republican Senate majority decided to thwart the will of the people and confirm a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election, after more than 60 million Americans have voted,&#34; then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said when Justice Amy Coney Barrett was nominated.

Now, with a 6-3 majority of Republican-appointed justices, many Democrats are demanding Supreme Court vacancies as soon as possible for Biden and the Democrat-controlled Senate to fill.
&#34;If Breyer refuses to retire, he’s not making some noble statement about the judiciary. He is saying he wants Mitch McConnell to handpick his replacement,&#34; Robert Cruickshank, the campaign director at Demand Progress, tweeted. 
&#34;Justice Breyer is playing a reckless and irresponsible gamble with the future of hundreds of millions of people,&#34; added former Vox writer Matthew Yglesias.

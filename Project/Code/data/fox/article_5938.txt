Mayorkas was asked again about the assessment of the terror threat, and past remarks that there was no known specific threat as the anniversary approached.
&#34;That, indeed, remains true,&#34; he said. &#34;There is no specific credible threat to the homeland at this time and what we do is we remain vigilant every single day.&#34;

He also said that the primary threat had shifted from foreign terrorists to domestic extremism.
&#34;We&#39;ve seen the threat evolve from the foreign terrorists seeking to enter the United States to the individual here radicalized to violence by a foreign terrorist ideology, to now what we consider the most serious terrorism related threat on our homeland, which is the domestic violent extremists,&#34; he said.

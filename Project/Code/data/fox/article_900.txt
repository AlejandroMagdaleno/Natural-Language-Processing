Kristen Clarke sits for confirmation hearing as assistant attorney general nominee for DOJ Civil Rights Division.
One of 
President Biden’s
 top 
State Department
 climate nominees touted the environmental benefits of the 
COVID-19
 pandemic in an op-ed published while the pandemic was in full swing.
Monica Medina, the president’s 
nominee
 for assistant secretary of the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Science Affairs, 
wrote
 
about the &#34;environmental upside&#34; of the pandemic in March 2020 and called for the economy to be restructured around &#34;green&#34; jobs.
Medina is an Obama administration alum and also the wife of Biden&#39;s White House chief of staff, 
Ron Klain
.
&#34;In the midst of the economic and health tragedy posed by the coronavirus pandemic, there is an unexpected bright side: the marked improvement in our environment as a result of the massive slowdown,&#34; Medina and her co-author, Our Daily Planet founder Miro Korenha, wrote in a Washington Post 
op-ed

&#34;With that comes a responsibility as well — to recover and rebuild in a way that helps deal with the challenge that will persist once the virus is under control,&#34; the pair continued.
Medina and her fellow author wrote that they were fearful that people would hurriedly get back to normal &#34;instead of appreciating what we had been missing in our consumption-driven, plastic- and fossil-fuel-addicted world.&#34;
The authors said that the recovery from COVID-19 pandemic was the time to make &#34;structural changes&#34; to the US economy and society and that comparing

&#34;Now is also the time to make the pivot to sustainability,&#34; the pair wrote. &#34;More stimulus funding will be needed to recover our economic vitality — to get businesses up and running again and to create jobs to replace the ones that are gone for good.&#34;
&#34;Why shouldn’t these new jobs be green jobs, such as ones to restore coastlines, help build renewable energy infrastructure and grow our food more sustainably?&#34; they asked.

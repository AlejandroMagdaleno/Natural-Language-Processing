Republican 
Sen. Josh Hawley
 of Missouri snapped his streak this week.
After opposing all of 
President Joe Biden
&#39;s 
nominees
 who&#39;ve come to a vote in front of the Senate, Hawley voted to confirm Cecilia Rouse, Biden&#39;s nominee to chair the Council of Economic Advisers.

Tied for second at 11 in voting against Biden nominees are 
Sens. Ted Cruz
 of Texas and 
Rick Scott
 of Florida. And 
Sen. Tom Cotton
 of Arkansas has opposed 10 of the Democratic president’s nominees.
What&#39;s one thing all four of these senators have in common?
They all may harbor national ambitions and are considered potential 2024 GOP 
presidential contenders

POMPEO - ON &#39;HANNITY&#39; - ACKNOWLEDGES MULLING POTENTIAL 2024 RUN
&#34;Senators looking to potentially run for president in 2024 need to do everything that they can to show Republican primary voters that they&#39;ve fought Biden administration policies with vigor,&#34; Lauren Zelt, a longtime Republican strategist and veteran of numerous Senate campaigns, told Fox News. &#34;Voting against Biden administration nominees helps them put together a record of opposing the president.&#34;
Doug Heye, a veteran GOP strategist and former Republican National Committee communications director, argued that nowadays in politics, &#34;everything is about demonstrating that you can fight. Talking about your willingness to fight is seen as being as more important than any kind of ability to throw a punch or land a punch.&#34;

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand
 of New York voted against 20 Trump nominees during the first five months of 2017. 
Sens. Bernie Sanders
 of Vermont and 
Elizabeth Warren
 of Massachusetts opposed 19 nominations.
And 
Sens. Cory Booker
 of New Jersey, 
Kamala Harris
 of California (now Vice President Harris) and 
Jeff Merkley
 of Oregon voted &#34;no&#34; 18 times. All but Merkley eventually launched presidential campaigns.
Sanders – who ended up being the final candidate standing against Biden in last year&#39;s Democratic primaries before ending his bid and backing the eventual nominee in April – is the only member of the Senate Democratic conference (Sanders is an independent senator who caucuses with the Democrats) to so far vote &#34;no&#34; against one of Biden&#39;s nominees. The progressive champion opposed the confirmation of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.

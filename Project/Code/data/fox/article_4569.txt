Former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton
 took aim at Texas Republican 
Sen. Ted Cruz
 Friday, for his decision to fly with his family to Cancun, Mexico amid devastating winter storms — and allegedly leaving his poodle behind.
&#34;Don&#39;t vote for anyone you wouldn&#39;t trust with your dog,&#34; Clinton said Friday following a photo taken by a Houston reporter that showed Cruz’s dog, Snowflake, looking out from a dark house.
Reporter Michael Hardy posted a picture of the Texan’s home Thursday, and said, &#34;Just drove by Ted Cruz’s house in Houston. His lights are off but a neighbor told me the block got its power back last night.&#34;
&#34;Also, Ted appears to have left behind the family poodle,&#34; he added.
Cruz, who came under fire for leaving his home state as millions struggled with extreme winter conditions, food shortages, power loss and boil water advisories, said he was just &#34;trying to be a dad&#34; and take his daughters on vacation.
&#34;In hindsight, I wouldn’t have done it,&#34; Cruz told reporters.
The winter storms throughout Texas pushed the energy industry to the brink, and resulted in 3 million people living without power. By late Thursday, the majority of Texans were able to turn on their lights once again.

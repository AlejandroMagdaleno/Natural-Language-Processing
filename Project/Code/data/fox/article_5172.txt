Louisiana Senator John Kennedy on the MLB politicizing baseball over the Georgia law.
President Biden, 
Major League Baseball Commissioner
 Rob Manfred, and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp need to have a public dialogue about the state&#39;s election 
law
, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told &#34;The Faulkner Focus&#34; on Wednesday. Kennedy called on Manfred and Biden to sit down and answer questions about the decision to move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta over the new law.
MOVING MLB ALL-STAR GAME FROM ATLANTA IS &#39;SERIOUS MISTAKE,&#39; FORMER COMMISSIONER FAY VINCENT SAYS
JOHN KENNEDY
: Harris, I, I don&#39;t hate anybody and I try to see grace wherever I can find it. But the decision by Mr. Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball to turn baseball into a blue sport, it just really makes me want to heave. 
Whether you agree or disagree with the Georgia law, I don&#39;t think any of us, I know I don&#39;t, want to have to think about politics when we watch baseball. And what disturbs me equally about Mr. Manfred&#39;s decision is he hasn’t explained it.&#34;
...
He hasn&#39;t explained why he thinks that Georgia&#39;s law, which I think was an honest effort toward election integrity, is racist. Now, Mr. Manfred, he looks like a smart guy, went to Cornell. He graduated from Harvard Law School. He probably washed his hands before it was cool. I think if he&#39;s going to do this to Major League Baseball, he owes an explanation. 
And what I would like to see him do is come on your show or one of your colleague’s shows, not just for three minutes, but for 30 minutes. I think he needs to go to Amazon, bUy a spine online and come on your show, maybe with Governor Kemp and let Commissioner Manfred explain why millions of Americans who support election integrity are racist. 
...
And after he&#39;s done, I think President Biden needs to come on unscripted for 30 minutes. Now, the president has made a very serious accusation. He has said everybody who believes in having an I.D., showing an I.D. before you vote is a racist. He said that everybody who is opposed to ballot harvesting, and we&#39;ve seen the treachery of that, is a racist. ... I didn&#39;t like it when Vice President Harris called President Biden, then both candidates, a racist because he didn’t support school busing. And I don&#39;t like it now.

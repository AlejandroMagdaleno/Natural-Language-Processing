Fox News&#39; Capitol Hill correspondent Chad Pergram takes a look at headwinds facing both parties.
Rep. Elise Stefanik said Thursday that 
Republicans
 need to work as &#34;one team&#34; 
in 2022
 to win back the 
House of Representatives
, comments made as she emerges as the favorite to replace Rep. Liz Cheney as the House Republican Conference chair. 
Stefanik, R-N.Y., made the comments in an interview on Steven Bannon&#39;s &#34;War Room Pandemic&#34; podcast. She emphasized her support for former President Donald Trump and said the GOP must work with Trump in the midterms. Trump endorsed Stefanik for the conference chair position on Wednesday. 
&#34;My vision is to run with support from the president and his coalition of voters,&#34; Stefanik said after Bannon brought up the topic of the new job she is seeking.
&#34;I&#39;m committed to being a voice and sending a clear message that we are one team and that means working with the president,&#34; and all GOP members of Congress, Stefanik said, referring to Trump.

ELISE STEFANIK, GOP CONFERENCE CHAIR FAVORITE, VOTED WITH TRUMP LESS THAN LIZ CHENEY
She added that she is &#34;proud to stand up for President Trump.&#34; 
Cheney, R-Wyo., has fallen out of favor with many House Republicans over the fact she&#39;s repeatedly launched broadsides against Trump over his false claims that the presidential election was stolen. 
&#34;The question before us now is whether we will join Trump&#39;s crusade to delegitimize and undo the legal outcome of the 2020 election, with all the consequences that might have,&#34; Cheney said in a Washington Post op-ed Thursday. &#34;While embracing or ignoring Trump&#39;s statements might seem attractive to some for fundraising and political purposes, that approach will do profound long-term damage to our party and our country.&#34;
Cheney&#39;s vote to impeach Trump earlier this year over his alleged role in inspiring the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by a mob of his supporters triggered an earlier effort to unseat her as conference chair. But House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., stood with Cheney then and she easily survived the effort.
Now, however, McCarthy, Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and many others have abandoned Cheney and support Stefanik. Even Republicans who were previously highly critical of Trump over the Jan. 6 attack are increasingly displeased with Cheney.
&#34;It&#39;s sad to me because I really like Rep. Cheney,&#34; an aide to a moderate Senate Republican told Fox News. &#34;I wish she could have just made her point and moved on to fighting Democrats.&#34;

TOP REPUBLICANS MCCARTHY, SCALISE BACK STEFANIK AS CHENEY REPLACEMENT AMID BATTLE OVER TRUMP
Stefanik in the past couple of years emerged as a fierce rhetorical fighter for Trump in Congress, especially during the 2019 House impeachment hearings. She was even named an honorary chair of Trump&#39;s reelection campaign in New York. But she&#39;s faced some criticism over her voting record. 
According to a tool on the 
FiveThirtyEight
 website on &#34;Tracking Congress In The Age Of Trump,&#34; Cheney voted with Trump 92.9% of the time compared to 77.7% for Stefanik. 
Cheney also has much higher scores from Heritage Action and the American Conservative Union. Those groups grade Cheney&#39;s votes with a 91% score and a 78% score respectively, compared to a 78% and a 44% score for Stefanik. 
&#34;Elise Stefanik is NOT a good spokesperson for the House Republican Conference. She is a liberal with a 35% CFGF lifetime rating, 4th worst in the House GOP,&#34; added the conservative group Club for Growth, citing its own metrics. &#34;House Republicans should find a conservative to lead messaging and win back the House Majority.&#34;

Stefanik, notably, lives in a much more moderate district than Cheney&#39;s bright-red Wyoming. Plus, many have noted, the position of conference chair is more about messaging than actual votes, and Stefanik&#39;s &#34;one team&#34; approach, her supporters say, is better for Republicans. 
&#34;We all need to be working as one if we&#39;re able to win the majority,&#34; McCarthy said on &#34;Fox &amp; Friends&#34; this week. &#34;And that&#39;s about the message about going forward, combating Joe Biden.&#34;
McCarthy continued to say that Republicans should &#34;all work together instead of attacking one another.&#34;

Fox News contributor Joe Concha torches liberals for ignoring their own guidance for wearing masks
A 
D.C.
 Council member who made national headlines in 2018 after suggesting that Jewish financiers control the weather is now running for mayor in the district.
Ward 8 Council member Trayon White Sr., a Democrat, is throwing his hat in the ring to possibly unseat Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has not yet announced whether she intends to seek another term.
&#34;He has a tremendous amount of support coming his way because he is willing to speak out for and advocate for those who need the leadership the most,&#34; an adviser for White 
told local media Wednesday
.
He is not to be confused with Robert White, a progressive Democrat who is also running for D.C. mayor.
Trayon White sparked a firestorm in March of 2018 after he filmed himself driving through downtown Washington as snowflakes fell on his windshield and ranted about &#34;climate manipulation.&#34;
DC LAWMAKER ACCUSED OF ANTI-SEMITISM REPORTEDLY GAVE CONSTITUENT FUNDS TO LOUIS FARRAKHAN EVENT
&#34;And D.C. keep talking about, ‘We’re a resilient city.’ And that’s a model based off the Rothschilds controlling the climate to create natural disasters they can pay for to own the cities, man,&#34; he said in the now-deleted video. &#34;Be careful.&#34;
The Rothschilds, a European Jewish banking family descended from Mayer Amschel Rothschild, have been the subject of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories for centuries, including that they control the world’s financial institutions and manipulate world events to their benefit.
White initially defended his comments, saying, &#34;The video says what it says,&#34; but he later apologized to the Jewish community.
&#34;I want to apologize to the Jewish Community and anyone I have offended,&#34; Mr. White tweeted at the time. &#34;The Jewish community have been allies with me in my journey to help people. I did not intend to be anti-Semitic, and I see I should not have said that after learning from my colleagues.&#34;
In addition to his comments about the Rothschilds, White also tweeted at prominent anti-Semitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan in 2013 and said he was &#34;honored&#34; to share a birthday with Farrakhan, adding, &#34;I must respect his intelligence, will, &amp; boldness.&#34;

White would later come under fire in 2018 after it was 
reported
 that he donated $500 to a Nation of Islam convention in Chicago where Farrakhan attacked &#34;powerful Jews&#34; as his enemy and made other disparaging comments. 
&#34;I am not resigning, I’m not backing down, I’m not discouraged, I’m not depressed, so run all the media stories you want because my people are going to support me,&#34; White said at the time when faced with backlash. 
News of White&#39;s candidacy was 
first reported
 by Washington City Paper.
&#34;Got some things I’m considering and working out,&#34; he told the paper Wednesday.

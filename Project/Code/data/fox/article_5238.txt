A federal judge ruled Monday that 
John Hinckley Jr.
 can be unrestrictedly released next year, more than 40 years after he shot then-
President Reagan
 in 1981.
Hinckley was committed to St. Elizabeth&#39;s hospital for more than 34 years before he was released under certain restrictions in 2016.
&#34;If he hadn’t tried to kill a president he would have been released unconditionally a long time ago,&#34; U.S. District Court Judge Paul Friedman said.

It was Friedman who had allowed Hinckley out five years ago, determining that Hinckley&#39;s mental condition was &#34;in full and sustained remission&#34; and had been for more than 27 years. He had been diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and major depression.
Upon his restricted release from St. Elizabeth&#39;s in 2016, Hinckley was required to live with his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia. He also was forbidden from having a firearm, contacting Reagan&#39;s children, or contacting actress Jodie Foster. Hinckley had been obsessed with Foster, and had written in a letter that he intended to assassinate Reagan to impress her.
The government has also been monitoring his care.

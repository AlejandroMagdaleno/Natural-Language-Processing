California gubernatorial candidate Larry Elder explains his position on major issues ahead of Gov. Gavin Newsom&#39;s recall election
Conservative radio show host Larry Elder has surged to the lead in Republican fundraising efforts in his campaign to replace 
California
 Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
 in the recall election. 
&#34;The numbers announced by my campaign today solidify my candidacy to defeat Gavin Newsom in the upcoming recall election,&#34; 
Elder said in a statement
 Thursday. &#34;Californians have shown up and believe in our mission to recall Newsom and elect me in his place. Newsom can raise an unlimited amount of funds for this election; therefore, every single donation to my campaign counts, whether small or large.&#34;
He has raised $4.5 million for his campaign in just 19 days
, eclipsing his Republican rivals. Elder has 
averaged $235,000 in funds
 each day since he entered the race on July 12, according to campaign filings.

He ended the month of July with $2.3 million of funds after covering other expenses. The recall election will be held on Sept. 14. 
Meanwhile, a committee opposing the recall of Newsom has fundraised $46 million through the end of July, with about $26 million available in the bank. 
Elder has also eclipsed other high-profile Republicans in polling, receiving 18% support from likely voters. While former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and 2018 gubernatorial candidate John Cox both received 10% support in the 
Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies/Los Angeles Times survey

GAVIN NEWSOM SLAMMED FOR MASK &#39;HYPOCRISY&#39; AND &#39;IGNORING SCIENCE&#39; BY GOP GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE LARRY ELDER
Elder has criticized the embattled Democratic governor during various campaign events, including last Saturday when he took aim at Newsom for &#34;ignoring science&#34; during the 
pandemic
. 
​​&#34;Where do I start about the job this man, Gavin Newsom, has done in the last two years?&#34; 
Elder told supporters in the Pacific Palisades
.
He has also slammed the incident that 
helped spark Newsom’s recall
: Photos from November showing the Democratic governor dining in a swanky restaurant maskless and surrounded by people from outside of his own household. 
&#34;He incurred a $12,000 wine tab,&#34; Elder said of the dinner. &#34;That&#39;s just for the wine.&#34;

&#34;He was sitting with the very same lobbyists and medical professionals who drafted the mandates they were violating by not wearing masks and by not socially distancing,&#34; he continued, calling it &#34;hypocrisy.&#34;
Republican National Committee members Harmeet Dhillon and Shawn Steel urged Republican delegates to not yet endorse a candidate, according to an email dated Friday and obtained by the Associated Press.
&#34;The polls are showing that the recall is in a statistical tie and we cannot afford to discourage voters who are passionate about a particular candidate, yet may not vote because their favored candidate didn’t receive the endorsement,&#34; they wrote.

&#34;Any of our GOP candidates would be superior to Gavin Newsom. We believe that the voters should decide his replacement, which will not only ensure a higher turnout of recall proponents but give Newsom’s successor the best chance of reelection in 2022.&#34;

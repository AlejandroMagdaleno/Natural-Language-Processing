Former U.N. Ambassador reacts to Biden&#39;s foreign policy agenda on &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39;
Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations 
Nikki Haley
 said in an interview published Friday that former 
President Donald Trump
 let his supporters down.
&#34;We need to acknowledge he let us down,&#34; Haley, whose ambassadorship was served under the Trump administration, told Politico, after saying that she believes Trump will never run for reelection as he faces further isolation, a &#34;suffering&#34; business and a social media ban.

&#34;He went down a path he shouldn’t have, and we shouldn’t have followed him, and we shouldn’t have listened to him. And we can’t let that ever happen again,&#34; she said of the Jan. 6 Capitol riots that resulted in the deaths of five Americans, including a Capitol Police officer.

Haley added later that she believes Trump&#39;s base still remains loyal to the former president, and the Republican Party will never be the same after the 45th president, nor does she think it should be.
&#34;I think what we need to do is take the good that he built, leave the bad that he did, and get back to a place where we can be a good, valuable, effective party. But at the same time, it’s bigger than the party,&#34; she said. &#34;I hope our country can come together and figure out how we pull this back.&#34;

Haley worked closely with the president during her time in the Trump administration before she 
resigned
 in October 2018. At the time, she described her role as ambassador as a &#34;blessing&#34; but offered no reason for leaving other than a belief that government officials must know &#34;when it’s time to step aside.&#34;

She said that &#34;there was nothing to fear about&#34; the former president when she worked for the administration.

&#34;I mean, he may have been brash. He may have been blunt. But he was someone who cared about the country. … I still stand by that. I don’t think we should ever apologize for the policies that we fought for and the things that we did during his four years,&#34; she said of Trump, adding that she is, however, &#34;deeply disturbed by what’s happened to him.&#34;

Meanwhile, Haley, who is widely speculated to run for president in 2024, recently launched a political action committee called 
Stand for America PAC
 – a separate entity from Haley’s &#34;Stand for America&#34; advocacy group – that aims to support conservative candidates ahead of the 2022 election cycle. It describes itself as &#34;laser-focused on the 2022 midterms and electing a conservative force to the House of Representatives and U.S. Senate to counter the liberal agendas of Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Chuck Schumer, and Nancy Pelosi.&#34;

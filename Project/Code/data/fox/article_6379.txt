House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 was roundly criticized after sharing a photo of her beside San Francisco Giants legend Willie McCovey while wishing Giants legend Willie Mays a happy 90th birthday. 
&#34;Happy 90th Birthday to an all-American icon, Willie Mays. A trailblazing, record-breaking baseball player, civil rights leader, and champion for youth sports and well-being, Willie Mays is a civic legend and national treasure. 
#SayHey90
,&#34; a tweet from Pelosi&#39;s official Twitter account read, along with a photo of McCovey.
PELOSI USED SHUTTERED SAN FRANCISCO HAIR SALON FOR BLOW-OUT, OWNER CALLS IT &#39;SLAP IN THE FACE&#39;
The tweet was later deleted, but that didn&#39;t stop social media users from questioning whether Pelosi can &#34;tell two Black men apart.&#34;
&#34;Madam Speaker, that&#39;s not Willie Mays,&#34; former Trump White House press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted in response to the now-deleted tweet.
NANCY PELOSI IS &#39;VERY PROUD&#39; OF THE RETURN OF CONGRESSIONAL EARMARKS
&#34;&#39;Cause all black people look the same,&#34; Fox News contributor Deneen Borelli commented.
One user called it &#34;pretty inexcusable,&#34; while conservative commentator Dinesh D&#39;Souza asked whether Pelosi thinks &#34;all Blacks look alike.&#34; 
&#34;Can she not tell two Black men apart,&#34; Chuck Woolery tweeted.

Pelosi has since issued a new tweet with the same wording and a photo of herself posing beside Mays.

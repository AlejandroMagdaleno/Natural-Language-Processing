With the Democrats playing defense as they try to hold onto their razor-thin majorities in both houses of Congress next year, and Republicans enjoying historical tailwinds at their backs, 
House
 GOP leader 
Kevin McCarthy
&#39;s quite confident his party will win back control of the chamber in the 
2022 midterm elections
.
Pointing to his record 
fundraising
 so far this year, the longtime congressman from California told Fox News this week that &#34;Republicans nationwide are fired up to take back the House&#34; and charged that &#34;Democrats are running for the exits.&#34;
FIRST ON FOX NEWS: MCCARTHY HAULS IN $57.8 MILLION SO FAR THIS YEAR
And if that happens in the 2022 elections, McCarthy – who faces virtually no opposition within the 
House GOP
 conference – would succeed Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi as House speaker.
As he pushes to regain the House majority and take control of the speaker’s gavel, McCarthy’s robust fundraising – and where he’s putting the campaign cash – is telling.

McCarthy’s hauled in $57.8 million during the first nine months of 2021, an off-election year record for Republicans. The fundraising figures were 
first reported by Fox News
 on Tuesday. 
&#34;Kevin McCarthy has been our number one fundraiser, not just this cycle but last cycle,&#34; National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) chair 
Rep. Tom Emmer
 emphasized. 
&#34;Our goal is to retake the majority and once and for all fire 
Nancy Pelosi
 and make Kevin McCarthy speaker. There’s no secret about that,&#34; the Minnesota Republican told Fox News on Wednesday.
MCCARTHY, AIMING TO RETAKE HOUSE, LIKENS 2022 MIDTERMS TO &#39;THE 100-YEAR STORM&#39;
McCarthy’s spreading the wealth.
The House GOP leader’s team spotlighted that McCarthy’s transferred $19.4 million over the past nine months to the NRCC, which is the House Republicans’ reelection arm, $8.3 million directly to GOP incumbents in highly contested seats, and $2.3 million to Republican state parties.
The fundraising transfers not only help give the GOP a better shot at retaking the majority, but they also further cement McCarthy’s already very secure position as leader of House Republicans. 
&#34;Transferring money to party committees or donating money to fellow Republicans campaigns is not only an important way to strengthen relationships, but it sends a clear signal to the rest of the caucus that you’re making the Republican majority a top priority,&#34; longtime GOP strategist Brian Walsh noted. &#34;Historically you’ve seen successful leaders in both parties do that.&#34;
Walsh, a veteran House and Senate GOP communications director, pointed out that McCarthy has &#34;recruited a lot of these folks, he’s developed relationships with them. This is making clear he views their success as a priority, which in any business helps that relationship.&#34;

And it sets McCarthy up for the speakership if the Republicans win back the majority next year, when they need a net gain of just five seats to retake control of the House that they lost in the 2018 midterms.
&#34;It’s only a matter of time and the entire conference is counting down the days. Speaker McCarthy is a shoo-in,&#34; 
Rep. Jim Banks
 of Indiana, chair of the Republican Study Committee, the nearly half-century-old caucus of House conservative lawmakers, told Fox News.

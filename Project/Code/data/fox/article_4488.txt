Retiring Senate Minority leader has no regrets as he crows, &#39;Romney didn&#39;t win did he?&#39;
Former Senate Majority Leader 
Harry Reid
 heaped praise on 
Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah,
 in a recent podcast, raising questions about the former Senate Democratic leader&#39;s suggestion during the 2012 presidential campaign that the latter didn&#39;t pay his 
taxes
.
Reid told the 
Salt Lake Tribune
 that he and Romney had a &#34;make up&#34; meeting of sorts after Romney lost his presidential bid as the Republican party&#39;s nominee.
&#34;I asked my friend of many, many years, Gov. [Mike] Leavitt of Utah who had been head of Health and Human Services, to arrange a meeting with me and Mitt Romney after the election,&#34; Reid said in a 
&#34;Mormon Land&#34; podcast
 published last week.
&#34;And we had a meeting at his home in Salt Lake where Mitt and I talked about probably how we had done things wrong about each other and our wives were there and we had a very nice meeting -- kind of a make-up session. So, I admire Mitt Romney. I think he&#39;s a very very fine human being.&#34;
HARRY REID ISSUES WARNING TO DEMOCRATS AHEAD OF 2020: DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE TRUMP
It&#39;s unclear what exactly the two spoke about, but Reid caused a stir in 2012 when he spoke about Romney from the Senate floor. &#34;The word&#39;s out that he hasn&#39;t paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove that he has paid taxes, because he hasn&#39;t,&#34; Reid said. Romney later released returns showing that he 
paid $1.9 million
 in taxes in 2011.
Politifact
 rated that claim &#34;pants on fire,&#34; stating: &#34;Reid has made an extreme claim with nothing solid to back it up.&#34; Reid claimed in 2012 that an &#34;extremely credible source&#34; told him that Romney hadn&#39;t paid taxes for ten years.
When CNN&#39;s Dana Bash asked Reid in 2015 about criticism that his remarks were McCarthyite, Reid seemed unrepentant. &#34;Well, they can call it whatever they want,&#34; Reid 
told her
. &#34;Romney didn’t win, did he?&#34;
Romney&#39;s office did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.

According to 
The Washington Post
, Reid also sent a thank you letter to Romney after his vote to convict President Trump last year. 
&#34;Donald Trump will go down ... as the worst president in the history of the country,&#34; Reid told the Tribune. &#34;And that says a lot because we’ve had some pretty bad ones.&#34;

President Biden plans to conserve 30% of U.S. land and water by 2030; Douglas Kennedy reports on the latest. 
The 
Biden
 administration proposed a plan, titled 
&#34;America the Beautiful,&#34;
 in hopes of boosting the conservation of U.S. land and water by the year 2030. The report is a decade-long effort, called &#34;30x30,&#34; which mandates protecting 30% of America’s waterways and land. 
The nationwide goal is to support conservation and restoration efforts on public, private, and tribal lands across the country; however, critics raise concerns on how Biden’s plan will &#34;protect&#34; their livelihood, calling it a &#34;land grab.&#34;
American Stewards of Liberty executive director Margaret Byfield is one of the main opponents of &#34;30x30,&#34; and addressed her worries to Fox News’ 
Douglas Kennedy.
 
BIDEN CLIMATE NOMINEE TOUTED &#39;ENVIRONMENTAL UPSIDE&#39; TO PANDEMIC
&#34;We&#39;re looking at a huge land grab that is going to fundamentally change land ownership in America,&#34; Byfield remarked. 
&#34;The worst management of our land is managed by the federal government,&#34; Byfield added. &#34;If environmentalists are truly concerned about protecting or conserving land and in creating habitats for species, they would be removing the federal restrictions.&#34;
A Georgia fisherman also told Kennedy that he &#34;fears government regulation&#34; will keep him from fishing in the future as a means to support his family.
&#34;I&#39;m worried about my kids. I&#39;m worried about everybody&#39;s kids,&#34; Greg Hildreth, a 30-year fisherman, told Kennedy. Hildreth expressed concern that the Biden administration is &#34;protecting&#34; the oceans from fishermen like him.
National Geographic’s Enric Sala is one of many conversationalists pushing for the &#34;30x30&#34; to state and local governments. 
&#34;We are taking so many fish out of the ocean,&#34; said Sala to Kennedy. &#34;We need half of the planet in its natural state so we can start by protecting at least 30% of our land and 30% of our ocean by 2030.&#34;
Sala went on to say the &#34;30x30&#34; plan is for the &#34;future of humanity, and everybody has a role to play.&#34;

Gov. Kate Brown signed the bill suspending reading, math and writing requirements for high school graduates
Oregon
 Gov. Kate Brown said Tuesday that she will re-implement a statewide indoor mask mandate for all residents regardless of their vaccination status as part of a new effort to combat a surge in 
COVID-19 cases
.
In addition to the renewed mask mandate, Oregon will require state employees who work in the executive branch to get fully vaccinated by Oct. 18 or six weeks after a COVID-19 vaccine receives FDA approval. Brown did not specify when the mask mandate will take effect, though she is scheduled to make a formal announcement on guidance at a press conference Wednesday.
&#34;The latest science is clear: although unvaccinated individuals are more likely to contract the disease, both vaccinated and unvaccinated people can spread the Delta variant. Masks are a simple and effective way to make sure you are not unknowingly infecting your friends, family members, neighbors, and colleagues. After a year and a half of this pandemic, I know Oregonians are tired of health and safety restrictions. This new mask requirement will not last forever, but it is a measure that can save lives right now.
Brown’s office said the safety measures were necessary because local public health data projected that &#34;hospitalizations will far exceed Oregon’s health system capacity in the next several weeks&#34; without preventative measures. On Monday, the state reported 2,329 new COVID-19 cases and a record 635 hospitalizations.
Oregon is the third state to require fully vaccinated residents to mask indoors amid a surge caused by the delta variant. The CDC recently adjusted its guidance to recommend masks regardless of vaccination status in areas with a high rate of transmission.
&#34;Oregon is facing a spike in COVID-19 hospitalizations––consisting overwhelmingly of unvaccinated individuals––that is quickly exceeding the darkest days of our winter surge,&#34; Brown added.

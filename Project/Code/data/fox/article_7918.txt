Sen. Mitt Romney 
said Monday that he was knocked unconscious in a fall over the weekend, but he was &#34;doing better.&#34;
The Utah Republican said the accident happened when he was spending time with his grandchildren in Boston. He told reporters he was taken to a hospital and got stitches on his right eyebrow and lip.

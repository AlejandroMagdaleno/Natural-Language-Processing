Democrat Rep. Rashida Tlaib says policing is beyond reform after the shooting death of Daunte Wright in Minnesota. Attorney Philip Holloway calls the idea the &#39;wrong way&#39; to address what happened.
Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., in a press conference Wednesday backed away from the calls of his liberal colleagues to defund the
 police
. 
Still, he said policing in the U.S. needs substantial reform. 
&#34;We definitely need reforms in the space of qualified immunity,&#34; the Virginia Democrat said, asked about a tweet from Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. &#34;But I, I am not in the camp that says, you know, we should disrespect police, we should reform police where police are necessary.&#34;
&#34;It wasn’t an accident,&#34; Tlaib tweeted after news of the police-involved shooting of Daunte Wright in Minnesota. &#34;Daunte Wright was met with aggression &amp; violence. I am done with those who condone government funded murder.&#34; 
&#34;No more policing, incarceration, and militarization. It can&#39;t be reformed,&#34; the congresswoman added. 
&#34;I don&#39;t need to tell anybody what to say, you asked me what I think,&#34; Kaine said when asked about Tlaib’s message. &#34;I was a mayor with a police force. I was governor with the state police force. Our police, I mean, look, I&#39;m going to a funeral, a police officer right now, gave his life to protect us and we need good policing.&#34; He added that qualified immunity currently shields police who engage in &#34;reckless behavior.&#34;
LIVE UPDATES: DAUNTE WRITE POLICE OFFICER SHOOTING BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE RELEASED 
White House press secretary Jen Psaki added that Tlaib&#39;s tweet was &#34;not the president&#39;s view.&#34; 
A Minnesota police officer fired a shot that killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright during a traffic stop Monday in what has been described by police as an &#34;accidental discharge.&#34;
WHO IS KIMBERLY POTTER, THE COP INVOLVED IN THE DEADLY DAUNTE WRIGHT SHOOTING?
Kaine also expressed concerns over a bill pushed by Democrats to address hate crimes that target Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI). He said the bill may have been rushed and should go through committee first. 
&#34;We should try to get to bipartisan support on this and I&#39;m a little troubled about the notion of just having a snap floor vote when the bill hasn&#39;t gone through committee,&#34; Kaine said. &#34;In my experience here, you tend to have snap floor votes on the partisan things, but you go through committee on these really important things.&#34;

Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, and Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., introduced a bill that would assign a Justice Department official to expedite reviews of COVID-19 related hate crimes and create an online database of such incidents. The bill would also institute new guidance to &#34;mitigate racially discriminatory language in describing&#34; the pandemic. Democrats are hoping to bring it forward for a vote as soon as Wednesday.

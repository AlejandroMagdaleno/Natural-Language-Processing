South Carolina senator questions why the American people are &#39;subsidizing&#39; blue states on &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39;
Sen. 
Tim Scott
, R-S.C., responded Monday to MSNBC host Joey Reid, who claimed that Scott provides a &#34;patina of diversity&#34; to Senate Republicans.

Not a single Republican in the Senate voted for it. The five previous relief bills under [a] Senate Republican majority, 90-plus senators voted for all of them ... That&#39;s bad for the American taxpayer.

What the Democrats want to do is codify a law allowing a 16-year-old to vote, not an 18, but a 16-year-old. They&#39;re looking for ways to transform the way that we vote in this nation. We should stand strong for things like voter ID, eliminating or reducing the amount of mail-in ballots. We should find ways to focus on states&#39; responsibilities for voting, not nationalising voting.

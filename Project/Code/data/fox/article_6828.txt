OBAMA&#39;S SCALED BACK 60TH BIRTHDAY BASH: CELEB ARRIVALS BEGIN TO SHOW WHO&#39;S IN, WHO&#39;S OUT
Beckham and Chapman both posted about having to delete the photos.
&#34;Had to delete everything due to the rules,&#34; Beckham said, the Post reported. &#34;It was epic for sure. If any videos surface it’s going viral. He danced the whole time. Nobody ever seen Obama like this before.&#34;
Chapman was visibly irritated after having to delete the evidence of his &#34;epic&#34; evening.
&#34;Epic night last night,&#34; he said in a video. &#34;I posted some stories of myself. Didn’t think anybody gave a damn, and I guess they did. That’s not cool. That’s not cool.&#34;
Singer Erykah Badu posted a video on Instagram of Obama holding a microphone and dancing onstage at the party, but it was later deleted Sunday morning.
&#34;Y&#39;all never seen Obama like this in your life,&#34; Chapman said on Instagram afterward.
Guests were seen leaving Obama’s party just before midnight, the Post reported. A local Massachusetts police officer 
called the traffic situation
 in the small town a &#34;s–t show&#34; on his radio as people started to head home, the Post reported.

Former Texas Gov. Perry decries border crisis on &#39;Your World&#39;
The 
Biden
 White House has sent a permissive message to human traffickers with its response to the 
southern border crisis
, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry told &#34;
Your World
&#34; Friday. 
&#34;The [border] issue has been around for some time,&#34; Perry told host Neil Cavuto. &#34;In 2012, we saw the trains that were coming up to the border ... [T]he Obama administration, at that particular point in time, [was] signalling -- not anywhere near as strongly as the Biden administration -- but even then they were signalling &#39;come on up&#39;. That signalling is the real problem. That&#39;s the real issue.&#34;
Perry added that Mexican cartels have opted to smuggle human beings across the southern border rather than illegal drugs.
&#34;Here&#39;s the untold story I think that we really need to talk about: What is happening along that border, the message that is being sent now is that it&#39;s OK to sexually traffic children,&#34; he said, &#34;because that&#39;s what is happening down there in a lot of different cases.&#34;
BIDEN BORDER COORDINATOR ROBERTA JACOBSON STEPPING DOWN 
According to Perry, the Biden administration is showing a &#34;lack of caring about human beings&#34; by not acting more forcefully to stop the flow of illegal immigration.
&#34;This is about modern-day slavery, that this administration, by allowing this to happen, but not sending the signal &#39;don&#39;t come&#39;, they&#39;re supporting it,&#34; he said. &#34;This is inhumane in the greatest sense.&#34;

Host Neil Cavuto then informed Perry that southern border coordinator Roberta Jacobson would be leaving her post, effective at the end of this month. 
&#34;Well, I&#39;ll let her speak for the reasons that she&#39;s leaving,&#34; the former energy secretary responded. &#34;But my bet is [she] may have a conscience. She may be seeing what&#39;s going on and recognizing that she can&#39;t live with herself if she continues to allow the activities going on on that border to go forward without addressing them.&#34;

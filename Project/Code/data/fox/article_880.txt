President Joe Biden
 said he is &#34;checking&#34; on if his presidential powers could give him the ability to intervene in states banning mask mandates.
&#34;I don’t believe that I do thus far. We’re checking that,&#34; 
Biden said Tuesday
 when asked if he could intervene in states such as Texas and Florida that have banned mask mandates. &#34;But there are — federal workforce, I can.&#34;
Biden&#39;s remarks came after he addressed the issue of states that have banned public schools districts from imposing mask mandates for the upcoming school year. The president 
called such effort
s &#34;disingenuous,&#34; arguing governors should allow districts to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.
&#34;And I find it interesting that some of the very people who are saying that, who hold government positions, are people who are threatening that if a schoolteacher asks a student if they have been vaccinated, or if a principal says that ‘everyone in my school should wear a mask’ or the school board votes for it, that governor will nullify that — that governor has the authority to say, ‘You can’t do that,’&#34; Biden said.
&#34;I find that totally counterintuitive and, quite frankly, disingenuous,&#34; he added.
Although Biden didn&#39;t single out any specific governor by name, the president has recently been embroiled in a war of words with 
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis

DeSantis has threatened to withhold funding from Florida school districts that require masking, with Biden responding by telling the governor to &#34;get out of the way&#34; of local districts that are attempting to stop the spread of 
COVID-19
 and the highly infectious Delta variant.

&#34;The other side isn&#39;t offering policies to make our lives better. They&#39;re offering conspiracies that only make our lives worse. We did our job. They refuse to do theirs. … That&#39;s why I&#39;m running for governor,&#34; Hobbs said in her 
launch video
.
&#34;In 2020, against all odds, in the middle of a pandemic, we proved that democracy works. It&#39;s been my job and life&#39;s work to make government work for the people of Arizona,&#34; she said.

The focus on Arizona&#39;s 2020 presidential election results raised Hobbs&#39; profile as she appeared on cable news to take issue with state Republicans. The Arizona state Senate is in the middle of an 
audit
 of ballots in Maricopa County that Hobbs has criticized.
&#34;We’ve got this state government being run by conspiracy theorists right now. They are out of touch with everyday Arizonans and that’s holding us back as a state,&#34; she told the 
Arizona Republic
.
Hobbs is a former state legislator, serving in the state House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013 and state Senate from 2013 to 2019, according to 
Ballotpedia
. 
A group called We the People AZ Alliance is organizing a recall effort against Hobbs that must gather 583,172 signatures by June 11, according to Ballotpedia.

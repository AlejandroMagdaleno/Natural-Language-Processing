Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discusses Biden meeting with world leaders at the G7 summit and what to expect from the president&#39;s meeting with Russia President Vladimir Putin.
Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that he believes the 
coronavirus
 pandemic originated with a leak out of a lab in Wuhan, 
China
, and that under the Trump administration the U.S. came close to uncovering the details of how it began.
During an interview on &#34;
Fox News Sunday
,&#34; Pompeo took issue with a question about the Trump administration failing to get enough information from China about the origins of COVID-19.
SECRETARY BLINKEN CALLS WHO&#39;S CORONAVIRUS ORIGIAN INVESTIGATION ‘HIGHLY DEFICIENT’
&#34;We have a really good idea what happened here,&#34; Pompeo said. &#34;There is an enormous amount of evidence that there was a leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. There is a pile of evidence a hundred feet high, I have high confidence that that’s the case. We pressed the Chinese Communist Party really hard – not just the State Department, but our CDC and others too.&#34;
Pompeo went on to say that the administration was &#34;serious in this endeavor&#34; and that it &#34;made clear that there would be real cost&#34; to the Chinese government.
An advisory board member to the 
World Health Organization
 told Fox News last week that 
China&#39;s
 &#34;massive cover-up&#34; on 
COVID-19
 is still happening today as the Wuhan lab-leak origin theory gains momentum.
CHINA OFFICIAL INSISTS COVID LAB-LEAK THEORY &#39;ABSURD&#39; IN BLINKEN CALL
&#34;The Chinese have engaged in a massive cover-up that is going on until this day, involving destroying samples, hiding records, placing a universal gag order on Chinese scientists and imprisoning Chinese citizen journalists asking the most basic questions,&#34; Jamie Metzl told &#34;
America&#39;s Newsroom
.&#34;
Pompeo said Sunday that the U.S. had been &#34;very close to being able to make a lay-down case for what actually happened&#34; with COVID-19.

&#34;We know enough now, the cover-up continues, and it’s time for accountability,&#34; he said.
Asked point-blank if he believes that the virus came from a leak out of the Wuhan Institute, Pompeo said, &#34;I do.&#34;
A top Chinese diplomat reportedly told current Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday that the lab-leak theory was &#34;absurd.&#34;
Blinken
, meanwhile, &#34;stressed the importance of cooperation and transparency regarding the origin of the virus, including the need for 
WHO
 Phase 2 expert-led studies in China,&#34; a State Department press release said.

The 
White House
 cheered the 
U.S. Supreme Court
’s decision to uphold 
ObamaCare
, with a nod at President Biden’s 2010 &#34;big f***ing deal&#34; reaction to then-
President Obama
 signing the Affordable Care Act into law. 
The Supreme Court on Thursday kept the ACA alive, ruling in a 7-2 decision that Texas and 17 other states – plus two individuals – lacked standing to challenge its constitutionality.
The states had argued that the law’s individual mandate was unconstitutional once it no longer carried a penalty because it had been justified as falling under the congressional power of taxation. They also claimed that the rest of the law could not survive without the mandate.
White House chief of staff Ron Klain, reacting to the high court&#39;s decision, tweeted: &#34;It&#39;s still a BFD.&#34;
Klain&#39;s tweet was a nod back to March 23, 2010 – when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, and then-Vice President Biden turned to him and whispered, &#34;this is a big f**king deal!&#34;

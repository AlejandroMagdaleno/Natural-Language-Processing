Outraged and frightened over a recent spike in violent 
crime
, community leaders in Oakland, 
California
, on Tuesday called for more action from 
Gov. Gavin Newsom
.
Though a news conference was led by business leaders from the city’s Chinatown neighborhood, which has seen assaults against Asian-Americans, speakers said they were concerned about rising crime throughout the city, FOX 2 of the Bay Area reported.
&#34;Governor Newsom, we want you to do this: Declare a state of emergency for the city of Oakland,&#34; Carl Chan, president of the Oakland Chinese Chamber of Commerce, told reporters in Chinatown’s Pacific Renaissance Plaza, according to FOX 2.
&#34;Governor Newsom, we want you to do this: Declare a state of emergency for the city of Oakland.&#34; 
&#34;We want you to bring in the California Highway Patrol,&#34; Chan continued. &#34;I’m not inly asking you to patrol Chinatown – all areas. We need your help.&#34;
As Chan and others spoke, they were backed by members of the &#34;Blue Angels,&#34; a blue-vested citizen patrol group that has formed in response to street assaults and other crimes, FOX 2 reported.

Tuesday’s news conference was the latest in a series of attempts by Oakland community leaders to draw media attention to the city’s crime problem, the station reported. It was prompted by last weekend’s shooting in Oakland of a Good Samaritan who tried to aid robbery victims who were being attacked in broad daylight, according to FOX 2.
&#34;Many of us, we feel strongly that this brave young man, willing to risk is life, these are the heroes,&#34; Chan told FOX 2, referring to the Good Samaritan, who has been identified only as &#34;Mr. Li.&#34; Chan himself has also been a crime victim, the station reported.

Recent offenses have even include a July 26 assault against former U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer of California, who wrote on Twitter that she was robbed of her cell phone while visiting Oakland&#39;s Jack London Square neighborhood.
Days after the incident, Boxer, a Democrat, bucked the &#34;Defund the police&#34; trend by calling for more policing in an interview with &#34;Inside the Issues.&#34;
Some of Oakland&#39;s elected officials have also urged more action against crime.
&#34;Our community was under attack,&#34; Oakland city council member Loren Taylor told FOX 2. &#34;And I say ‘our community’ because we are one Oakland. When one of us is attacked, all of us are attacked.&#34;
There was no immediate response to the news conference from Newsom’s office or from the California Highway Patrol, the station reported. The governor&#39;s recent Twitter posts have mostly addressed the state&#39;s wildfires and coronavirus-related issues, not crime.

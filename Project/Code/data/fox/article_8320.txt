Two 
Senate
 committees are meeting Tuesday for the first public congressional inquiry into the 
Jan. 6 Capitol
 security failures that allowed a pro-Trump mob to storm the building as lawmakers were certifying the 
presidential election
 results in a joint session.
The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSCAC) and Rules and Administration Committee convened at 10 a.m. as they seek information about &#34;preparations and response efforts&#34; to the attack. 
The senator said he expects there to be a follow-up hearing taking into account the lack of primary information.
Testimony is being heard Tuesday from former U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, former Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael Stenger and former House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving, as well as Metropolitan Police Department acting chief Robert Contee.
&#34;This was an attack on our democracy and must NEVER happen again,&#34; Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., tweeted last week when the hearing was announced. &#34;As @HSGAC Chairman, I&#39;m planning to get to the bottom of this.&#34;
Also leading the hearing is HSCAG Ranking Member Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Rules and Administration Committee Chair Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Rules and Administration Ranking Member Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. 
The attack on Jan. 6 left nearly dozens of police officers injured and several people dead, including Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick. 
&#34;There was really no suspected harmful activity,&#34; Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., told &#34;Sunday Morning Futures&#34;. &#34;People really were caught by surprise. This was not predictable. This was not foreseeable as the House managers continue to talk about. I just don&#39;t believe it was.&#34;
President Joe Biden&#39;s attorney general nominee, Merrick Garland, vowed Monday to focus on the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol as the first step in combating extremist violence.

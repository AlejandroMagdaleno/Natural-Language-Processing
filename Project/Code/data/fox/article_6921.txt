The 
Senate
 parliamentarian determined that lawmakers cannot include a pathway to citizenship for illegal aliens in a budget reconciliation package, but 
Rep. Ilhan Omar
, D-Minn., is pushing the Senate and the 
Biden
 administration to do it anyway.
Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough determined Sunday night that the provision fell outside the scope of what is allowed in a reconciliation bill – which cannot be filibustered, thus requiring the support of only a simple majority in the Senate.
SENATE PARLIAMENTARIAN RULES AGAINST DEM AMNESTY PUSH IN RECONCILIATION BILL
&#34;This ruling by the parliamentarian, is only a recommendation. @SenSchumer and the @WhiteHouse can and should ignore it,&#34; Omar said. &#34;We can’t miss this once in a lifetime opportunity to do the right thing.&#34;
MacDonough said the provision was &#34;a policy change that substantially outweighs the budgetary impact of that change,&#34; as it would change the immigration status of 8 million people. She also said it would raise the deficit by an estimated $140 billion over 10 years.

The parliamentarian also noted that if a provision granting a new immigration status to people could be done through reconciliation, so could a provision stripping such status.
&#34;[P]ermitting this provision in reconciliation would set a precedent that could be used to argue that rescinding any immigration status from anyone - not just those who obtain LPR status by virtue of this provision -- would be permissible because the policy of stripping status from any immigrant does not vastly outweigh whatever budgetary impact there might be,&#34;  MacDonough said.
The 
White House
 took the parliamentarian’s decision more seriously but continues to support efforts in the Senate to include an immigration measure in the bill.

&#34;The President has made very clear that he supports efforts by Congress to include a pathway to citizenship in the reconciliation package and is grateful to Congressional leadership for all of the work they are doing to make this a reality,&#34; said a White House spokesperson. &#34;The Parliamentarian’s ruling is deeply disappointing but we fully expect our partners in the Senate to come back with alternative proposals for the Parliamentarian to consider.&#34;
Schumer said he was &#34;deeply disappointed&#34; by MacDonough’s decision and said, &#34;Senate Democrats have prepared alternate proposals and will be holding additional meetings with the Senate parliamentarian in the coming days.&#34;

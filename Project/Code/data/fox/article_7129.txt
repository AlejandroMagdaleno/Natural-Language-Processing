Retired commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan Gen. David Petraeus addresses conflict in the Middle East. 
The Department of Defense on Wednesday released a memo telling veterans that &#34;service is never for naught&#34; and advising them of mental health options as the war in Afghanistan comes to a dismal end.
&#34;Remember that what is happening now does not minimize or negate the experiences of all who served overseas,&#34; the memo states. &#34;Talking can be very therapeutic, whether it’s to a local chaplain, psychologist or someone you served within the military. Do what feels right for you. There is not one way to think or feel or act. The important thing is to take advantage of the numerous mental health care resources that are available to you.&#34;

&#34;We both believe – without question – that your service was meaningful, powerful, and important,&#34; the statement said. &#34;You answered the call to serve, proudly carrying the torch of so many generations of Marines before you.&#34;
&#34;Was it worth it?&#34; the statement added. &#34;Yes. Does it still hurt? Yes.&#34;

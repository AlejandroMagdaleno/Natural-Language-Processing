Justice Democrats and members of 
Congress
 linked to the group have been silent after news that Odessa Kelly, a progressive congressional candidate from 
Tennessee
 backed by Justice Democrats, has a history of inflammatory social media posts, including calls for violence against 
Republican
 lawmakers.
Fox News&#39; inquiries to the offices of Reps. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 of New York, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota were not returned at the time of publication. Fox News&#39; inquiry to Justice Democrats was also not returned at the time of publication.
JUSTICE DEMOCRATS-BACKED CANDIDATE ATTENDED FARRAKHAN SPEECH, SAID PELOSI SHOULD HIRE PIMP TO BEAT UP TED CRUZ
Kelly, who is staging a primary challenge against Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., went on Facebook the day of President Biden&#39;s inauguration and posted a list of suggested agenda items for the new administration&#39;s first 100 days. Those included standard Democratic wishes for stimulus checks, packing the Supreme Court and student loan forgiveness, as well as jokes about attacking GOP leaders.
&#34;Day 9: Allow Pelosi to hire the best pimp that Memphis or Detroit has to offer to Smack tha [emoji] outta Ted Cruz and the rest uv’em...(y’all know the ones)!&#34; she wrote.

      Odessa Kelly.

Also on the list were suggestions that Kelly specifically said were in jest, such as &#34;Day 4: Blow Up Maralago,&#34; referring to Trump&#39;s Florida resort and residence, and &#34;Day 5: Disappear Mitch to some secret CIA prison.&#34;
Aside from her jokes, Kelly&#39;s Facebook history includes an April 2012 post about how she was attending a speech being delivered by anti-Semitic Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and a May 2020 post declaring, &#34;If you vote for Trump, YOU ARE A RACIST!&#34;
PROGRESSIVE GROUP THAT RECRUITED AOC TO RUN FOR CONGRESS TARGETS FIRST INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT OF 2022 CYCLE
Justice Democrats spokesperson Alexandra Rojas praised Kelly on Tuesday after she launched her campaign.
&#34;As someone who has spent her life as a public servant and a community organizer, @OdessaKellyTN is exactly the kind of Democrat we need in Congress,&#34; Rojas wrote on 
Twitter
.
Meanwhile, Kelly and Cruz sparred on Twitter on Tuesday after he described her as &#34;the angry, violent Left.&#34;
&#34;You told people to storm the Capitol. Then they listened to you and did. Get outta here with this. I can’t wait to get to Washington and take on Ted Cruz’s agenda of division, greed, and straight up clownery. It’s time for fundamental change,&#34; Kelly wrote on 
Twitter
.
The Tennessee candidate said Wednesday that her campaign has already 
raised over $100,000

&#34;Odessa&#39;s fundraising numbers after launch are significant. AOC raised just $60k in her first six months during the 2018 cycle, and Jamaal Bowman hit the $100k mark after his first *week* in the 2020 cycle. The infrastructure for progressive primary challengers keeps growing,&#34; Justice Democrats spokeman Waleed Shahid wrote on 
Twitter
 on Wednesday.
Kelly is looking to join progressives like Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., who were elected to Congress after defeating veteran moderate Democrats. Kelly&#39;s campaign website describes her positions as consistent with the far-left wing of the Democratic Party, calling for the Green New Deal, &#34;Medicare-for-all&#34; and a ban and registry for assault weapons.

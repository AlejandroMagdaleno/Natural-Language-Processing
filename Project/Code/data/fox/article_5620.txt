Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., calls on Biden to &#39;get off your a--&#39; and visit border detention facilities
A fuming Sen. 
Lindsey Graham
, R-S.C., railed against President 
Joe Biden
 and his administration&#39;s role in the crisis at the 
southern border
 Tuesday, suggesting the White House is gaslighting the public into believing the U.S.-Mexico frontier is secure.
Graham joined 
&#34;Hannity&#34;
 to praise Fox News contributor 
Sara Carter&#39;s exclusive report
 about conditions in migrant holding facilities.
&#34;If this is proven to be true and I have no doubt it is,&#34; Graham said, &#34;all I can say -- let me tell you this, [migrant holding] POD 3A, according to your reporting, is supposed to hold 80 people. There were 694 children in POD 3A being managed by two Border Patrol agents.
&#34;God bless the Border Patrol, God bless the customs agents who are dealing with the Biden administration s---show at the border.&#34;
MEXICO PRESIDENT SAYS BIDEN IMMIGRATION POLICIES CAUSING BORDER SURGE
Graham demanded congressional Democrats show the same outrage that they showed during the Trump administration, pointing to now-Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., joining a protest held 
outside a Trump-era detention center
 in the Everglades near Homestead, Fla.  Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y., also traveled to Texas during the Trump administration to stage a similar 
protest
.
&#34;I am going down [to the Mexican border] with 18 senators Friday and if I am denied the ability to look into any place I want to go, we are going to shut the Senate down,&#34; Graham said. &#34;Where are all the liberal hypocrites? Where is AOC, where&#39;s Elizabeth Warren -- or Vice President Harris ...&#34;
&#34;Here&#39;s my message: President Biden and Vice President Harris, with all due respect, get off your a-- and go to the border and look and see what you have caused by policies that will not work,&#34; he added. &#34;Quit denying the obvious.&#34;
Graham called the dire situation in 
Texas
, 
New Mexico
 and 
Arizona
 &#34;beyond a crisis [and] a national security disaster in the making.&#34;
&#34;It will never change, President Biden, until you tell everybody to go home and stop bringing people into the United States. If you&#39;re not willing to do those two things, we will have a million or two people at our border by June.&#34;

When pressed as to whether he believes the Border Patrol, under the auspices of Mayorkas, would actually allow him access to any detention facilities, Graham replied:
&#34;I&#39;d hate to be the guy that told me &#39;no&#39;.&#34;

White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on a new Fox poll that shows how Americans view the Biden administration.
Stanford University announced that it will require weekly 
COVID-19
 testing for everyone who enters campus regardless of vaccination status.
&#34;Weekly testing with Color Genomics will be required for all students living on campus, living in university provided off-campus student housing, or coming to campus, regardless of vaccination status,&#34; said Stanford Vice Provost for Student Affairs Susie Brubaker-Cole in in a 
letter to students
 announcing the decision Wednesday.
The move is a reversal from the decision the school made last month, when it 
eliminated the testing requirement
 for fully vaccinated students. But citing the highly contagious delta variant that has spread throughout the country in recent weeks, the school decided that reinstating the testing requirement was the best way to prevent spreading the virus on campus.
Stanford joins several other elite universities that have decided to require testing for vaccinated students, including Ivy League institutions such as 
Harvard
, 
Princeton
, and 
Brown
.
The decisions come as schools across the country grapple with how to handle the return of students to campus amid a spike in cases largely driven by the delta variant. Schools in 
over 30 states
 have announced their policy of requiring vaccination for students returning to campus, while other schools have 
mandated testing
 for those who have yet to receive the 
vaccine

The move to require vaccination has also caused some resistance among some students, with a growing number of them taking to the internet in search of ways to 
obtain a fake vaccination card
.
&#34;I need one, too, for college. I refuse to be a guinea pig,&#34; one student on said on Reddit in a thread about falsifying vaccination cards.

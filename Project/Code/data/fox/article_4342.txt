Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas appears before House Homeland Security Committee to discuss border, other concerns.
Sen. 
Lindsey Graham
, R-S.C., is taking aim at Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas&#39; job as pressure against the Homeland Security chief mounts over the border crisis.
&#34;It is clear to me the Biden Administration has lost control of the border. Under its current leadership, it doesn’t have either the will or capability to fix the problem,&#34; Graham said in a scathing release Thursday.

&#34;The solutions are obvious but will require an understanding that the Biden Administration’s early policy choices – to abandon Trump’s successful border policies – was a mistake. It is time for DHS Secretary Mayorkas to change course or change jobs,&#34; Graham added. 
PSAKI STONEWALLS ON PRESS ACCESS TO BORDER FACILITIES
&#34;The situation is bad and only going to get worse,&#34; the senator concluded. &#34;Unless there is immediate and drastic change, the worse is yet to come — by far.&#34;
Graham’s shot comes as Biden faces down an increasingly perilous situation at the southern border that his administration still refuses to call a crisis.

Rep. Kat Cammack, R-Fla., got into a terse 
exchange 
with Mayorkas during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing Wednesday, asking the DHS secretary &#34;how many more&#34; people would &#34;have to be kidnapped&#34; like her friend from high school before the secretary decides to &#34;take action.&#34;
Mayorkas responded, saying the query was &#34;extraordinarily disrespectful&#34; as the congresswoman’s time in committee expired.

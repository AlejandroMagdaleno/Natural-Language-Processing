John Hopkins University Dr. Marty Makary weighs in on mask messaging on &#39;FOX Report&#39;
Sen. 
Rand Paul
, R-Ky., stepped up his criticism of 
Dr. Anthony Fauci’s
 call for Americans to continue wearing masks after receiving their COVID-19 vaccinations on Tuesday, citing a study that found evidence that vaccinated or recovered individuals had protection against COVID-19 variants.
Paul, an eye doctor by training, has been a prominent critic of Fauci’s guidance that Americans should wear masks even after vaccination while scientists work to understand the effects that emergent COVID-19 variants have on immunity. In his latest salvo against the infectious disease expert, Paul linked to a pre-print of a study by the National Institute of Health.
&#34;Dr. Fauci, great news! T cell immunity after natural infection shown to include variants,&#34; Paul wrote on Twitter. &#34;Do we still need to wear multiple masks after we’ve recovered or been vaccinated?&#34;
The study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, found that &#34;virtually all anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T-cell responses should recognize these newly described variants.&#34; The study’s authors noted that its findings were based on a limited sample size.
In February, Fauci warned it was &#34;possible&#34; that Americans would need to wear masks into next year. He has also suggested that wearing two masks makes &#34;common sense&#34; to provide additional protection against the virus.
Fauci’s warnings have rankled Paul, who argued at a Senate hearing earlier this month that the call by the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for continued mask-wearing amounted to &#34;theater.&#34;
&#34;You want to get rid of vaccine hesitancy? Tell them you can quit wearing your mask after they get the vaccine,&#34; Paul said. &#34;You want people to get the vaccine? Give them a reward instead of telling them that the nanny state&#39;s going to be there for three more years and you got to wear a mask forever. People don&#39;t want to hear it. There’s no science behind it.&#34;
&#34;Well, let me just state for the record that masks are not theater,&#34; Fauci said in response. &#34;Masks are protective.&#34;
&#34;If you have immunity, they&#39;re theater,&#34; Paul said. &#34;If you already have immunity you&#39;re wearing a mask to give comfort to others.&#34;
&#34;I totally disagree with you,&#34; Fauci replied.

In a March 21 tweet, Paul linked to another study published on the JAMA Network, which he said showed &#34;vaccines and naturally acquired immunity DO effectively neutralize COVID variants.&#34;

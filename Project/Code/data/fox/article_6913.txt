Defense Secretary
 Lloyd Austin&#39;s stated ambition to drive 
domestic terrorists
 and extremists out of the military amounts to a &#34;witch hunt,&#34; former 
Marine
 Lt. Col. Oliver North told &#34;
Tucker Carlson Tonight
&#34; Thursday. 
According to North, the military-wide stand-down ordered by Austin last month in an attempt to address the issue has resulted on &#34;1.5 million man-days lost from readiness and preparing to deal with the number one adversary we&#39;ve got on the planet Earth, the Communist Chinese.&#34;
&#34;Our military has two missions, no more than that,&#34; North said later in the segment. &#34;Number one, deter war. Number two, if you have to fight a war, win it.&#34;
Earlier in the program, Carlson noted that Austin, a retired general, had been &#34;plucked&#34; by Biden &#34;from the cynical world of private equity.
&#34;You’re not supposed to notice that,&#34; the host added. &#34;You&#39;re only supposed to notice Lloyd Austin is Black.&#34;
Carlson went on to criticize Austin as an &#34;openly political&#34; military leader who had made &#34;the entire armed services submit to a political purity test. Anyone who had views that Lloyd Austin 
found extreme
 had to leave.&#34;
North noted that when he enlisted, he had to sign a simple document stating under penalty of perjury that he was not a member of the Communist Party. Today, he continued, the document pledging one&#39;s duty to their brothers-in-arms is pages and pages longer.

&#34;&#39;I got your back&#39; are four very important words, not a sentiment, but a pledge. And that pledge goes up and down. It goes to the guy standing beside you who is carrying an [ArmaLite rifle] ... The bottom line of it is, that pledge goes all the way to the top,&#34; he said.
&#34;Does this president have the backs of those guys who volunteered to come into service? I don’t think so.&#34;

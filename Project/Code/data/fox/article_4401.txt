The 
California
 Assembly on Thursday failed to pass a bill that would have raised taxes on handguns and ammunition.
The bill by Assemblyman Marc Levine, a 
Democrat
 from San Rafael, would have imposed a 10% tax on the sales price of handguns and an 11% tax on the sales price of rifles, precursor parts and ammunition.
The tax would have applied to retailers, not consumers. But a legislative analysis of the bill said retailers could have passed that cost along to buyers. The Assembly Appropriations Committee estimated it would have generated $118 million per year, with the money going toward gun violence prevention programs and research.
A majority of the Assembly’s 80 members voted for the bill. But because the bill would create a new tax, it required a two-thirds vote. The bill fell five votes short of the 54 required for passage. Democrats control 59 votes. But several Democrats come from more moderate districts, making a tax increase on guns a tough vote for them.

Despite the bill’s failure on Thursday, Levine said he believes it’s possible to revive the legislation later this year.
&#34;California
 is in the midst of a gun violence epidemic that will only end when our leaders have the courage to do what is right and necessary to end it,&#34; Levine said.
The vote comes one week after nine people were killed in a mass shooting at Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority rail yard in 
San Jose, California
. Assemblyman Alex Lee, a 
Democrat
 from San Jose, read the names of each victim on the Assembly floor as he urged his colleagues to support the bill.
&#34;We continue to see the breaking news headlines of yet another mass shooting in our nation on a nearly weekly basis. And frankly, I’m sick of it,&#34; he said.

In a letter to lawmakers, the pro-gun group Gun Owners of 
California
 wrote that the bill wasn’t fair because it sought to &#34;penalize the lawful for the misdeeds of the unlawful.′
Levine, the author of the bill, said his goal was in part a response to the increase in gun sales and gun violence since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.
California
 already imposes a fee of $37.19 on gun sales, which includes a fee for background checks.

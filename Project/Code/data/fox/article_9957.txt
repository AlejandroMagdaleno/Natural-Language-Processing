Andrew Yang, former Democratic presidential candidate, speaks at night four of the 2020 Democratic National Convention.
After sharp criticism from the left, 
New York City
 mayoral candidate 
Andrew Yang
 walked back his &#34;overly simplistic&#34; tweet supporting 
Israel
 while condemning &#34;Hamas terrorists&#34; amid a flare-up of violent clashes between Israelis and Palestinians. 
Yang said he had met with a group of campaign volunteers after he sent the tweet. &#34;Many of them were upset with my recent tweet expressing solidarity with the people of Israel in conjunction with the violence in the region this week that has claimed the lives of innocents and children on both sides. 
&#34;They felt my tweet was overly simplistic in my treatment of a conflict that has a long and complex history full of tragedies. And they felt it failed to acknowledge the pain and suffering on both sides,&#34; Yang continued. &#34;They were, of course, correct.&#34; 
&#34;Support of a people does not make one blind to the pain and suffering of others. Again, most everyone wants to be able to live and pray in peace.&#34;
Yang’s original tweet supporting Israel had left out mention of Palestinian suffering.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D- N.Y., among others, quickly called out her fellow Democrat Yang for having planned to attend an Islamic event in the city after he put out a statement of support for Israel. 
&#34;Utterly shameful for Yang to try to show up to an Eid event after sending out a chest-thumping statement of support for a strike killing 9 children, especially after his silence as Al-Aqsa was attacked,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. &#34;But then to try that in Astoria? During Ramadan?! They will let you know.&#34;

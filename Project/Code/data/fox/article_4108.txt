The 
District of Columbia Court of Appeals
 suspended 
Rudy Giuliani’s D.C. law license
 Wednesday pending the disposition of his 
New York
 suspension.
In a two-page order the court cited the action last month by a 
New York
 appeals court and said 
Giuliani
 is &#34;suspended from the practice of law in the District of Columbia pending final disposition of this proceeding.&#34;
TEACHER UNION PRESIDENT RANDI WEINGARTEN CLAIMS REPUBLICANS ‘BULLYING’ TEACHERS ON RACE, ‘HONEST HISTORY’
Giuliani,
 former 
President Donald Trump’s
 lawyer throughout his efforts to have the 2020 election overturned, was suspended from practicing law by the 
New York
 court because he made false statements while trying to get courts to overturn Trump&#39;s loss in the presidential race.
An attorney disciplinary committee had asked the 
New York
 court to suspend 
Giuliani’s
 license on the grounds that he had violated professional conduct rules as he promoted theories that the election was stolen through fraud.
The court made the action immediate, even though disciplinary proceedings aren’t complete, because there was an &#34;immediate threat&#34; to the public.

The practical impact of the 
D.C. court
 ruling is questionable, since Giuliani&#39;s law license in Washington was already inactive.

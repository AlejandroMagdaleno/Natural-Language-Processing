Former President 
Donald Trump
 said in a Memorial Day statement that the United States&#39; fallen 
military
 members are &#34;unrivaled heroes&#34; with &#34;immortal&#34; legacies, as the nation celebrates the 
holiday
 dedicated to those who gave their lives in service of the country. 
&#34;On this Memorial Day, we remember the fallen heroes who took their last breaths in defense of our Nation, our families, our citizens, and our sacred freedoms,&#34; Trump said. &#34;The depth of their devotion, the steel of their resolve, and the purity of their patriotism has no equal in human history.&#34;
&#34;It is because of their gallantry that we can together, as one people, continue our pursuit of America’s glorious destiny,&#34; Trump added. 
According to the 
Congressional Research Service
 (CRS), more than 1 million American service members have died in the history of the United States, dating back to the Revolutionary War. The most deadly conflicts were the Civil War and World War II, which killed more than 400,000 Americans each.

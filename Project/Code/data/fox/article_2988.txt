165-page report

including President Biden

Sliwa, who won the city’s Republican mayoral primary in early July, will stage the protest at 633 Third Avenue on the East Side of Manhattan, according to a release from the Republican’s campaign.
The 67-year-old founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime group will face Democrat Eric Adams, a retired New York City police officer, in the city’s general mayoral election in November.

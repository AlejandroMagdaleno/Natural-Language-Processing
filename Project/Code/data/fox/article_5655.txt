on Sunday said it was necessary for kids to return &#34;safely&#34; to school under certain guidelines.
Biden, during a pre-
Super Bowl
 interview on &#34;CBS Evening News.&#34; said he expects the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to release &#34;science-based&#34; guidelines later this week on requirements for schools to reopen amid the ongoing 
pandemic

Asked by anchor Norah O’Donnell whether some 20 million American children have not been in the classroom for nearly a year – and the mental health damage that has caused – constituted a &#34;national emergency,&#34; Biden said that it does.

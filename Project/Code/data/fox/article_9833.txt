Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer slams Omar for controversial tweet: &#39;it&#39;s flat out wrong&#39;
The 
White House
 has so far remained silent on &#34;Squad&#34; Rep. 
Rashida Tlaib’s
 recent remarks that the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) dubbed &#34;anti-Semitic dog whistling.&#34;
Tlaib, D-Mich., came under fire from ADL president Jonathan Greenblatt for her comments claiming that people working &#34;behind the curtain&#34; to stop a &#34;free Palestine&#34; are &#34;profiting&#34; off Americans.
&#34;We&#39;ve heard this kind of ugly [antisemitic] dog whistling before, but it&#39;s appalling when it comes from a member of Congress,&#34; Greenblatt tweeted on Tuesday. 
ADL PREZ ACCUSES TLAIB OF ‘ANTISEMITIC DOG WHISTLING’ FOR REMARKS RIPPING THOSE PROFITING ‘BEHIND THE CURTAIN’
The White House didn&#39;t return Fox News&#39; request for comment 
&#34;We also need to recognize — and this is for me as a Palestinian American — we also need to recognize as I think about my family and Palestine that continue to live under military occupation and how that really interacts with this beautiful Black city that I grew up in,&#34; Tlaib said on Tuesday, referring to her hometown of Detroit.
&#34;You know, I always tell people cutting people off from water is violence from Gaza to Detroit,&#34; Tlaib continued. &#34;And it&#39;s a way to control people, to oppress people. And it&#39;s those structures that we continue to fight against.&#34;
WHITE HOUSE SILENT ON IF ADMIN AGREES WITH NOMINEE THAT OMAR’S DUAL LOYALTY COMMENTS WERE ANTI-SEMITIC
&#34;I know that you all understand the structure that we&#39;ve been living under right now is designed by those that exploit the rest of us for their own profit,&#34; the congresswoman also said. &#34;I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s the issue around global human rights and our fight to free Palestine or to pushing back against those that don&#39;t believe in the minimum wage or those that believe that people have a right to health care and so much more.&#34;
&#34;And I tell people those same people that if you open the curtain and look behind the curtain, it&#39;s the same people that make money and, yes they do, off of racism, off of these broken policies,&#34; Tlaib continued. &#34;There is someone there making money and you saw it!&#34;

Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel joins &#39;Fox Report&#39; with the details
President Biden on Tuesday is set to announce a partnership with ride-sharing companies Uber and Lyft to provide free rides to anyone going to a COVID-19 vaccination aapointment through July 4, the White House said. 
BIDEN SAYS WEARING MASKS INSIDE &#39;STILL GOOD POLICY,&#39; EVEN WHEN VACCINATED
The White House said Tuesday that as part of the &#34;historic commitment,&#34; Lyft and Uber would promote rides to and from tens of thousands of vaccination sites through their apps. Through the program, people will have the ability to simply select a vaccination site near them and follow directions to redeem their ride.

The feature is set to launch within the next two weeks. 
&#34;By helping Americans get a free ride to a vaccination site, Lyft and Uber are eliminating a potential barrier and driving America closer to the President’s goal of getting 70% of the U.S. adult population with at least one shot by July 4th,&#34; the White House said Tuesday. 
Meanwhile, the president is also set to announce Tuesday that some of the nation&#39;s largest community colleges will serve as vaccination sites for students, staff and local communities throughout May and June.

Biden is also set to announce funding that will be &#34;immediately available&#34; through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for states to fund more on-the-ground efforts to promote vaccinations in their communities, including phone banking, door-to-door canvassing, and pop-up vaccination sites in workplaces and churches. 
The president set a new goal for 70% of Americans to receive at least the first dose of a COVID vaccine by July 4. As of Sunday, that number stands at 58%, White House coronavirus task force director Jeffrey Zients said.

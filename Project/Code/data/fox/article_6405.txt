Congressman Byron Donalds, R-Fla., explains to John Roberts on &#39;America Reports&#39; how Democrats are using Georgia&#39;s election reform laws to play the race card.
The US Navy’s &#34;extremism&#34; training says it’s okay to advocate for Black Lives Matter (BLM) while at work but sailors are not allowed to discuss &#34;politically partisan&#34; issues, according to training slides obtained by Fox News. 
A question posed in a &#34;scenarios for discussion&#34; slide asked if BLM was &#34;political stuff&#34; that superiors in the Navy are &#34;not supposed to be talking about at work,&#34; according to the slides, which Fox obtained from a U.S. military official who took part in the training at the Pentagon.

The answer given by the Navy called 
BLM
 a &#34;public policy issue&#34; and gave the green light for advocating for the organization &#34;as long as the behavior is otherwise lawful and the advocacy is not politically partisan in nature.&#34;
&#34;Advocating for or against a public policy issue (as here) is authorized as long as the behavior is otherwise lawful and the advocacy is not politically partisan in nature (e.g. it doesn&#39;t specifically address a political party),&#34; the slide reads. &#34;If the discussions make you uncomfortable, discuss the matter with your boss or another supervisor.&#34;
Pentagon press secretary John Kirby was asked at Monday&#39;s press briefing whether talking about BLM in the workplace is &#34;considered partisan.&#34;

Kirby responded that he was &#34;not able to answer that question&#34; and that the discussion as to why could &#34;go down a rabbit hole on a million different things.&#34;
&#34;What we&#39;re trying to get after here is the kind of ideology that inspires conduct and behavior. … And it&#39;s not about one side or the other on the aisle,&#34; said Kirby. &#34;It&#39;s not about what God you worship or choose not to worship. It&#39;s about ideology that inspires you or can inspire others to bring harm inside the force.&#34;
&#34;And that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to get after,&#34; Kirby added.
BLM PRESSURES DEMOCRATS TO EMBRACE BILL DESCRIBED AS ‘ROADMAP FOR PRISON ABOLITION’
Kirby said the Pentagon was taking their push to combat extremism in their ranks &#34;seriously&#34; and recognized that the issue was &#34;a hard problem to get our arms around.&#34;
&#34;But we can’t just put our head in the sand and pretend it doesn’t exist. We can’t just say, ‘well, it’s not a problem.’ It is a problem,&#34; continued Kirby. &#34;The other problem is, we don’t know how big it is. And so that’s what we’re trying to learn. And I think you’re gonna see this unfold over time.&#34;
&#34;I&#39;m not going to be able to come to the podium this week, next week or the week after with a plan and say, &#39;This is it. This is how this is how it&#39;s defined,’&#34; the press secretary continued.

&#34;And this is exactly how deep the problem is. This is going to be something and Secretary Austin has made very clear he&#39;s going to work on every day that he&#39;s the Secretary of Defense.&#34;
&#34;It’s not something that you can take your foot off the pedal on,&#34; he added.

Even liberal outlets acknowledge problems
President Biden
 is sticking to his claim that his Build Back Better agenda will cost the average American taxpayer nothing.
&#34;The cost of the Build Back Better Agenda is $0,&#34; the White House 
tweeted
 Sunday. 
&#34;The President&#39;s plan won&#39;t add to our national deficit and no one making under $400,000 per year will see their taxes go up a single penny,&#34; the tweet read. &#34;It&#39;s fully paid for by ensuring big corporations and the very wealthy pay their fair share.&#34;
TEAM BIDEN CLINGS TO RECONCILIATION BILL ZERO-COST CLAIM SHOT DOWN BY WASHINGTON POST FACT-CHECKERS
Biden and his administration 
have repeatedly claimed
 that Build Back Better, a $3.5 trillion reconciliation package, will cost zero dollars, despite multiple analysts rebutting the claim from both sides of the political aisle. The president bases the zero-cost claim on the idea that the package will add nothing to the federal deficit because the cost will be offset by tax increases and other revenue-generating schemes.
Congress&#39; Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the reconciliation bill will only raise $2.1 trillion through taxes over 10 years, falling far short of the $3.5 trillion cost. And even the $3.5 trillion figure is being contested as the true cost: The Wall Street Journal editorial board 
argued
 it&#39;s based on &#34;budget gimmickry including entitlement phaseouts and phase-ins&#34; and that the real cost &#34;will be at least $5 trillion, probably far more.&#34; 
WHAT&#39;S IN BIDEN&#39;S PLAN FOR THE IRS TO MONITOR NEARLY EVERY AMERICAN&#39;S BANK ACCOUNTS?
The Washington Post&#39;s fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, 
similarly called
 the zero-cost claim &#34;misleading&#34; and argued that lawmakers &#34;play all sorts of budget games to achieve that mythical zero within the 10-year budget framework.&#34; He said the bill&#39;s impact on the deficit could &#34;be as low as zero or as high as $1.75 trillion over 10 years.&#34;

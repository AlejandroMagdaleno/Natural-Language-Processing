Nursing home administrator Michael Kraus talks with Aishah Hasnie in an exclusive interview Thursday on &#39;America Reports&#39;

A 
New York
 nursing home was visited by the state&#39;s Department of Health days after Fox News reported on the administrator&#39;s alleged early warning about the impact of 
Gov. Cuomo&#39;s
 executive order.
The visit, according to Kraus, started at around 9 a.m. ET Tuesday and stretched at least past 3 p.m. ET. It&#39;s unclear why exactly the visit occurred, but Kraus said the health department asked about a resident possibly running away.
&#34;So far it seems to be just a coincidence and not retaliation,&#34; he told Fox News via text. &#34;They didn&#39;t find any problems.&#34;
Last week, Fox News aired a story with Kraus describing his remarks during a conference call with other directors, state officials and hospital leaders.
NEW YORK NURSING HOME WHISTLEBLOWER: CUOMO&#39;S ORDER WAS &#39;RIDICULOUS,&#39; WARNED OFFICIALS &#39;WE CAN&#39;T BE DOING THIS&#39;
&#34;I said that&#39;s ridiculous,&#34; he said, recalling his reaction to the March 25 order. &#34;We can&#39;t be doing this. It&#39;s just not right to the residents.&#34;
He added that he vocalized his concerns during phone conversations but stopped bringing it up afer he was shot down.
&#34;I did vocalize it,&#34; he said. &#34;And then once it was shot down, I never spoke again.&#34;

Cuomo&#39;s order has landed him in hot water as critics argued that it put nursing home residents&#39; lives in danger.
Kraus told Fox News that the department had made three coronavirus-related visits to his facility, in addition to Tuesday&#39;s.

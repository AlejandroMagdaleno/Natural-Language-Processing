South Carolina Republican joins &#39;Hannity&#39; for a one-on-one about looming impeachment trial
Senate Minority Leader 
Mitch McConnell
 proposed delaying former 
President Trump
&#39;s impeachment trial until February so the former president&#39;s new legal team will have time to prepare his defense.

impeach Trump
 for &#34;incitement of insurrection&#34; after a violent mob stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 and delayed the certification of President Biden&#39;s electoral college win. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday she expects to transmit the article to the Senate &#34;

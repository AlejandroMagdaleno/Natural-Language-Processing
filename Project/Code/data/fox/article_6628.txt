Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has this advice for President Biden regarding potentially rejoining the U.N. Human Rights Council: &#39;Don&#39;t do it.&#39;
Former U.N. Ambassador 
Nikki Haley
 on Tuesday criticized 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.,
 for her call for a federal commission to &#34;rein in&#34; the media environment -- calling it a &#34;clear shot&#34; at media outlets.
&#34;AOC is calling for a federal commission to &#39;rein in our media,&#39; in a clear shot at any outlet that isn’t liberal,&#34; Haley tweeted. 
AOC SAYS COMMISSION BEING &#39;DISCUSSED&#39; TO HELP &#39;REIN IN&#39; MEDIA ENVIRONMENT AFTER CAPITOL RIOT  
Ocasio-Cortez was speaking during a live stream last month about the Jan. 6 attack on Capitol Hill when she responded to a question about whether there was a discussion on Congress on &#34;truth and reconciliation or media literacy initiatives.&#34;
&#34;I can say, there is absolutely a commission being discussed but it seems to be more investigatory, in style rather than truth and reconciliation, so I think that’s an interesting concept for us to explore, and I do think that several members of Congress, in some of my discussions, have brought up media literacy because that is a part of what happened here and we’re going to have to figure out how we rein in our media environment so that you can’t just spew disinformation and misinformation,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez said.
&#34;It’s one thing to have differentiating opinions but it’s another thing entirely to just say things that are false,&#34; she continued. &#34;So that’s something that we’re looking into.&#34;
Haley was one of a number of Republicans who criticized the idea as antithetical to American principles of free speech and press freedom.
&#34;Few ideas are more dangerous than a govt agency overseeing the media,&#34; Haley tweeted. &#34;Apparently, AOC never read the First Amendment’s guarantee of press freedom.&#34;
Haley and Ocasio-Cortez have clashed before. In November 2020, Haley responded to AOC’s claim that the government should &#34;pay people to stay at home.&#34;
NIKKI HALEY TAKES ON AOC, SQUAD, &#39;ULTRA-LIBERAL&#39; POLICIES, REJECTING CIVILITY
&#34;AOC, Are you suggesting you want to pay people to stay home from the money you take by defunding the police?&#34; Haley said in response. &#34;Or was that for the student debts you wanted to pay off, the Green New Deal or Medicare for All?&#34;

That sparked a furious response from the New York congresswoman who said it was &#34;utterly embarrassing that this woman was a governor &amp; still doesn’t have a grasp on public investment.&#34;

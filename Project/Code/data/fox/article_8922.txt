Former Texas GOP congressional candidate and U.S. Army veteran Wesley Hunt says the rolling outages from winter weather are &#39;inexcusable&#39; and calls for an &#39;all hands on deck approach&#39; to energy policy. 
A Texas mayor who reportedly resigned this week after sparking a backlash for telling residents impacted by 
winter storm
 power outages that &#34;no one owes you or your family anything&#34; is now saying his wife has been fired from her job, it has emerged. 
Tim Boyd announced in a Facebook post Tuesday he has quit his role as mayor of Colorado City, hours after making the controversial comments, reports say. City Manager David Hoover confirmed the resignation to 
NBC News
. 
&#34;No one owes you or your family anything; nor is it the local governments responsibility to support you during trying times like this! Sink or swim, it’s your choice!&#34; Boyd wrote on Facebook Tuesday morning, according to 
KTXS
. &#34;The City and County, along with power providers or any other service owes you NOTHING! I’m sick and tired of people looking for a damn hand out!&#34;

TEXAS MAYOR QUITS AFTER SAYING RESIDENTS ARE ‘LAZY’
 
&#34;If you don’t have electricity you step up and come up with a game plan to keep your family warm and safe. If you have no water you deal with out and think outside of the box to survive and supply water to your family,&#34; the post – which is filled with typos -- reportedly continued. &#34;If you were sitting at home in the cold because you have no power and are sitting there waiting for someone to come rescue you because your lazy is direct result of your raising! Only the strong will survive and the week will perish.&#34; 
Boyd concluded the message by saying &#34;Get off your ass and take care of your own family!&#34;, KTXS reports. 
Hours later, Boyd posted a follow-up message announcing his resignation, the station adds. 
&#34;I would never want to hurt the elderly or anyone that is in true need of help to be left to fend for themselves,&#34; he reportedly wrote. &#34;I was only making the statement that those folks that are too lazy to get up and fend for themselves but are capable should not be dealt a handout.&#34;

Boyd reportedly added he &#34;had already turned in my resignation and had not signed up to run for mayor again on the deadline that was February 12th!&#34; 
&#34;The anger and harassment you have caused my wife and family is so undeserved....my wife was laid off of her job based off the association people gave to her and the business she worked for,&#34; the post continued, according to KTXS. &#34;She’s a very good person and was only defending me! But her to have to get fired from her job over things I said out of context is so horrible.&#34; 
Then, in reference to his initial comments, Boyd wrote &#34;I was speaking as a citizen as I am NOT THE MAYOR anymore,&#34; KTXS reports. &#34;I apologize for the wording and ask that you please not harass myself or my family anymore!&#34; 
The Colorado City Council on Thursday did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News, while efforts to reach Boyd himself were unsuccessful.

As of Thursday morning, the power outage situation in Colorado City appears to have been resolved, as there are only 32 homes and businesses in Mitchell County still without electricity, according to 
Poweroutage.us
. 
However, Colorado City – which has around 4,000 residents – is getting no relief from the bitter cold that continues to grip the state of Texas. Temperatures in that area Thursday morning were around 7 degrees, the

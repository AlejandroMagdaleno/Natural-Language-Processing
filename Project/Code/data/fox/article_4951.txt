A federal judge said he&#39;ll soon decide whether to block a new 
Indiana
 law that would require doctors to tell women undergoing drug-induced abortions about a disputed treatment for potentially stopping the abortion process.
U.S. District Judge James Patrick Hanlon in Indianapolis heard arguments Monday in a lawsuit filed by abortion rights groups seeking to stop the so-called &#34;abortion reversal&#34; law from taking effect as scheduled July 1.
The state’s witnesses in court maintained the law would ensure that a woman has information about halting a medication-induced abortion if she changes her mind after taking the first of the two drugs used in the procedure and takes a different drug instead.

Dr. Courtney Schreiber, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Philadelphia, pushed back, calling the state’s new law &#34;deeply distressing&#34; and &#34;mortifyingly harmful.&#34; She denounced Delgado’s assertions, noting there is &#34;no evidence&#34; that an abortion can be reversed and that a woman might have an increased risk of hemorrhaging if she does not take the second dose of medication for an abortion.
Hanlon said his initial ruling will be made &#34;as soon as possible&#34; and is expected before the law takes effect.

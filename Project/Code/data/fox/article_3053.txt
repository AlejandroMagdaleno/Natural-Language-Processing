The Washington, D.C.
 City Council on Tuesday voted unanimously on a &#34;compromise&#34; package after Mayor Muriel Bowser proposed spending $11 million on hiring additional police officers for the city&#39;s force.
Fox 5 DC reported
 that it was Bowser’s hope to pay for 170 new police officers that she said in a letter is a &#34;critical step in our comprehensive public safety approach.&#34;
The package approved on Tuesday provides $5 million for the department to hire more officers, but earmarked $6 million &#34;toward other wrap-around service measures and violence interruption.&#34;
The Fox DC report said that Bowser and Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee have been pressuring members of the council to refocus on the department and its personnel needs. 
&#34;If we’re not careful, we’re going to break the department,&#34; Bowser told reporters on Tuesday. &#34;And so we need what we need. We need to hire officers as soon as we can and we need the council to understand that.&#34;
At Large Councilmember Elissa Silverman told the station that the only reason that Bowser called for such an increase is because of the national media attention the city received after shootings &#34;outside 
Nationals Park
 and
 14th Street
, where CNN Correspondents dined.&#34;

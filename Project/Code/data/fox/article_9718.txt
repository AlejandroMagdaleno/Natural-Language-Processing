The 
White House
 website appears to have removed a section where people can submit 
petitions
 for the president to review.
The URL &#34;petitions.whitehouse.gov&#34; currently redirects to the White House&#39;s homepage instead of the original page, which was initially set up under former President Obama in 2011.
It&#39;s unclear why the redirect occurs but an internet archive shows the original &#34;We the People&#34; page 
appearing
 as far back as the day of President Biden&#39;s inauguration on Jan. 20.
Notable recent petitions have included a request that Trump release his taxes, one requesting that Antifa be classified as a terrorist organization, and another that pushed for the government to create a 
Death Star.
WHITE HOUSE LAUNCHES WEBSITE FOR ONLINE PETITIONS
The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.
In 2011, Obama&#39;s adminstration described the feature as a way for citizens to exercise the Constitutional right to petiton the government.

The New York Times urges the Biden administration to appoint &#39;reality czar&#39; to combat &#39;disinformation.&#39; Fox News contributor Joe Concha with reaction.
President Biden
 on Thursday announced that his administration will move to dramatically increase the number of admissions of refugees into the U.S. -- the latest significant shift in

&#34;It’s going to take time to rebuild what has been so badly damaged but that&#39;s precisely what we’re going to do,&#34; he said.
Biden said he will increase the number of refugees the U.S. brings in each year from 15,000 to 125,000. That number would be higher than that under President Barack Obama by 15,000.
Biden said the aim is to raise it for the first full fiscal year, beginning in October, and that he would work with Congress to make what he called a &#34;down payment&#34; on that sooner.

It marks the latest in a number of sweeping reforms to immigration by Biden that largely reverse the policies of his predecessor.

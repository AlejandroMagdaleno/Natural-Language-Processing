Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., reacts to &#39;unprecedented&#39; Iowa election dispute.
Rep. 
Nancy Mace,
 R-S.C., blasted Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 on Wednesday for her &#34;hypocrisy&#34; in trying to overturn 
Iowa
 Republican 
Mariannette Meeks
&#39; narrow House win. 
REPUBLICANS ACCUSE DEM ELECTION LAWYER OF &#39;SERIOUS CONFLICT OF INTEREST&#39; IN CASE TO REVERSE IOWA HOUSE RACE
REP. NANCY MACE: Nancy Pelosi’s hypocrisy knows no bounds. What we’re seeing today, you see [Democrat] Rita Hart trying to get D.C. politicians to elect her because the Iowa voters just didn’t. The hypocrisy here, you see Nancy Pelosi saying that there’s no voter fraud that exists, yet there was voter fraud so we’ve got to overturn the results of this election and I hate politics. I’m in it because I hate it, and I hate it because of the hypocrisy and that’s what we’re seeing today...
When you talk about a legally certified election, the votes in Mariannette Meeks&#39; race were counted and recounted and in some instances were recounted for a third time again...
If we’re going to have voting system standards we’ve got to have it across the board ... Nancy Pelosi’s in power and she wants to have more power. This is a power grab by Nancy Pelosi and D.C. Democrats.

In-N-Out president and heiress Lynsi Snyder, whose grandparents founded the first of the restaurants in 1948, says that she strives to maintain the success of her family’s iconic chain with a little help from her faith.

 vaccine mandate for customers that resulted in the city temporarily closing one of its locations.
The fast-food chain trended on Twitter Tuesday after the company 
told
 the city of San Francisco &#34;we refuse to become the vaccination police for any government&#34; and was closed temporarily by the city’s health department for not demanding customers show proof of vaccination against the 
coronavirus

The reaction to In-N-Out&#39;s stand was not all positive and prompted some to call for a boycott on Twitter.
The San Francisco Department of Public Health closed the Fisherman’s Wharf In-N-Out location on Oct. 14 after the popular burger joint did not check the vaccination status of customers, which violates an August mandate from the city requiring indoor diners to show proof of vaccination.

&#34;Our store properly and clearly posted signage to communicate local vaccination requirements,&#34; In-N-Out Burger’s Chief Legal and Business Officer, Arnie Wensinger said in a statement to Fox News. &#34;After closing our restaurant, local regulators informed us that our restaurant Associates must actively intervene by demanding proof of vaccination and photo identification from every Customer, then act as enforcement personnel by barring entry for any Customers without the proper documentation.&#34;
Wensinger slammed the San Francisco Department of Health&#39;s requirements as &#34;unreasonable, invasive, and unsafe&#34; and accusing the city of asking restaurants to &#34;segregate Customers&#34; based on vaccine documentation.
&#34;We fiercely disagree with any government dictate that forces a private company to discriminate against customers who choose to patronize their business,&#34; the statement said. &#34;This is clear governmental overreach and is intrusive, improper, and offensive.&#34;
The store has since reopened, but indoor dining is not available.

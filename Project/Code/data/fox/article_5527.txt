Former Las Vegas Police Lt. Randy Sutton explains the 
Conservative
 lawmakers slammed e-commerce giant 
Amazon
 for selling &#34;Blue Lives Murder&#34; apparel as America experiences an increase in ambush-style attacks against the 
police
.
Several Republican lawmakers eviscerated the online shopping mall for selling clothing bearing the anti-cop slogan while police have seen an uptick in attacks on them – especially ambush-style attacks – and almost 130 officers have been shot this year alone. 
The National Fraternal Order of Police, the nation’s largest police union, says the &#34;defund the police&#34; movement and fiery rhetoric toward cops has created a culture of disrespect.
Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., said the &#34;derision&#34; of police being sold by corporations is the opposite to the values America stands for.
NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS SHOT THIS YEAR REACHES 128, UNION SAYS ‘DEFUND’ MOVEMENT A FACTOR
&#34;The callous attitude of disregard and derision toward law enforcement, projected by corporate media and large corporations, runs contrary to every concept of Americanism,&#34; Cawthorn told Fox News in a Wednesday statement.
&#34;In this country we must honor and respect those who walk the beat, who wear the badge, and risk their lives for us,&#34; he continued. &#34;When a burglar breaks into your home, it’s a law enforcement officer who responds. We sleep peacefully at night because good men stand watch at the door.&#34;
&#34;There’s nothing ‘woke’ about deriding law enforcement,&#34; the congressman added. &#34;It’s wrong, plain and simple.&#34;
Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, told Fox News on Wednesday that it is &#34;appalling&#34; for a company to profit off of &#34;vile language&#34; against police.
AMAZON PULLED JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS DOCUMENTARY AS CENSORSHIP OF CONSERVATIVE CONTENT CONTINUES
&#34;Any vendor monetarily benefiting from vile language in opposition to law enforcement is appalling. Woke culture is proving to be a cash cow that further divides our nation,&#34; Sessions said. &#34;I am for rule of law and for backing the brave men and women in blue.&#34;
Sessions’ fellow Texas Republican Rep. Pat Fallon warned that the demonization of police will &#34;demoralize&#34; officers and said corporations that &#34;censor&#34; conservatives should face accountability.
&#34;When you demonize police you are going to demoralize police. The police are our heroes. As citizens, we are not free when we are not safe,&#34; Fallon said. &#34;We pay them to go into harm&#39;s way to protect us and our families and they do a phenomenal job.&#34;
&#34;Woke corporations that promote false narratives about law enforcement and censor conservative speech should be held accountable,&#34; he continued.
REPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS FROM AMAZON AFTER REMOVAL OF BOOK ON TRANSGENDERISM
Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., tweeted that Amazon’s sale of merchandise accusing police of murder and simultaneous censoring of conservative publishers is &#34;
unacceptable
.&#34;
&#34;Amazon sells ‘Blue Lives Murder’ clothing – merchandise with a false and blatantly inflammatory message – but censors conservative publishers because of their political ideology,&#34; Buck wrote. &#34;This is unacceptable.&#34;
When asked for comment on the criticism about why the company is selling the controversial clothing, an Amazon spokesperson told Fox News that the company provides customers with a plethora of views across its products and that consumers could express their views on certain products through reviews.
&#34;As a retailer, we provide our customers with access to a variety of viewpoints across books, videos and products,&#34; the spokesperson said. &#34;We strive to provide our customers with the widest possible selection, and we do not endorse the content of any particular book, video or product.&#34;
AMAZON SLAMMED FOR ALLOWING ‘BLUE LIVES MURDER’ APPAREL ON SITE: ‘DEHUMANIZING AND DEMORALIZING’ FOR COPS
&#34;We understand that some customers may find some products objectionable, and we provide customers with a variety of ways to engage and express their views, including through product reviews,&#34; the Amazon spokesperson continued.
The Detectives’ Endowment Association sent a letter to Amazon’s CFO Brian Olsavsky warning that the &#34;Blue Lives Murder&#34; apparel puts law enforcement officers &#34;at peril and risk.&#34;
&#34;It has come to my attention that your website is selling tee-shirts (sic) and other items emblazoned with the words ‘Blue Lives Murder,’&#34; the letter

. &#34;It’s disheartening that your company would allow this disgusting motto on your sales platform,&#34;

The online retail giant has also come under fire for pulling a documentary on conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and removing a book on transgenderism from their company’s shelves.
In addition to the &#34;Blue Lives Murder&#34; apparel, Amazon 
also carries
 clothing supporting the Free Palestine movement, which claims Israel is engaged in &#34;apartheid,&#34; as well as an &#34;
Anti Zionist Shirt

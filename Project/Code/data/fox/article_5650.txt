FOX News Washington correspondent Rich Edson joins &#39;Special Report&#39; with latest on Capitol Hill security
Acting 
Secretary of Defense
 Chris Miller said in a statement on Monday that the Department of Defense has not received any intelligence indicating a potential insider threat to the 
inauguration
 of 
President-elect Joe Biden
 on Jan. 20.
Miller added that the department is &#34;leaving no stone unturned in securing the capital,&#34; noting that all National Guardsmen deployed to Washington, D.C. will be vetted. 
&#34;This type of vetting often takes place by law enforcement for significant security events. However, in this case the scope of military participation is unique,&#34; Miller 
said
. &#34;The D.C. National Guard is also providing additional training to service members as they arrive in D.C. that if they see or hear something that is not appropriate, they should report it to their chain of command.&#34;

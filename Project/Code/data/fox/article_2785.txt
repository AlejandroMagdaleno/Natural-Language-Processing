The 9th woman to accuse the New York governor of misconduct claims Cuomo acted in a &#39;overtly sexual, highly inappropriate manner.&#39; Bryan Llenas reports from Brooklyn.
Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo’s
 top aide Melissa DeRosa was ready to call it quits on the day it was 
revealed she admitted
 the state deliberately withheld the complete coronavirus death toll in nursing homes — but the governor &#34;begged her stay,&#34; a state lawmaker reportedly claims.

told WRGB

Cuomo spokesman and senior adviser Rich Azzopardi denied DeRosa ever wanted to leave.
&#34;Ron Kim doesn’t know what he is talking about and this is not the first time he’s lied about Melissa,&#34; Azzopardi told The Post in a statement.
A top New York doctor reportedly visited CNN host Chris Cuomo, brother of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, several times at his Hamptons home to administer COVID-19 tests; Bryan Llenas has the details from Brooklyn, N.Y.
&#34;He should be ashamed and stop spreading baseless rumors,&#34; Azzopardi said.

Rising a wave of praise from press.
Americans definitely aren’t united on this question.​
Just one in five Americans have &#34;a great deal of confidence&#34; in President Biden’s ability to make good on his goal to unify the country, according to a new poll released Sunday.
While 22 percent said Biden will unify the country, 24 percent remained highly skeptical, saying that they have no confidence &#34;at all&#34; that he will be able to do so, the 
ABC News/Ipsos poll found.

Thirty-five percent said they have a &#34;good amount&#34; of confidence Biden could unite the country and 19 percent said they had &#34;not so much&#34; confidence.​
Respondents to the survey were asked their opinion after watching a video of Biden’s inaugural address​ urging Americans to see &#34;each other not as adversaries, but as neighbors.&#34;​
&#34;We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting and lower the temperature. For without unity, there is no peace — only bitterness and fury. No progress — only exhausting outrage. No nation — only a state of chaos,&#34; Biden said.

At the same time, 71 percent of those who watched the entire or parts of Biden’s inaugural address said his message was &#34;very&#34; or &#34;somewhat&#34; convincing.
Another 29 percent who watched it found it &#34;not so convincing&#34; or &#34;not convincing at all.&#34;
The poll surveyed a random sample of 504 adults across the country between Jan. 22-23.
It has a plus/minus 5.0 percentage points margin of error.

FOX News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest developments on &#39;FOX News Live&#39;
White House
 communications director Kate Bedingfield remained confident Sunday that 
President Biden
&#39;s 
$1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill
 narrowly passed by the 
Senate
 over the weekend would ultimately reach the president&#39;s desk, as the legislation is up for a vote in the House this week where Democrats hold a narrow majority.
In an appearance on CNN&#39;s &#34;State of Union,&#34; Bedingfield described the bill -- called American Rescue Plan – as a &#34;historic and transformational piece of legislation&#34; that will &#34;cut child poverty in half&#34; by making investments in the child tax credit, fund a vaccine program and get money out to schools to reopen, even with the nation strapped with $28 trillion in debt.
BIDEN GIVES PREMATURE PAT ON THE BACK TO DEMOCRATS ON COVID BILL, IGNORES PROGRESSIVES
&#34;This is an incredibly transformational, frankly progressive piece of legislation,&#34; Bedingfield told CNN host Jake Tapper, who questioned whether the bill has enough votes in the House to pass. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., can only afford to lose four votes and still send the bill to Biden&#39;s desk for his first major legislative win. Progressives in the House have raised concerns about changes to the bill that eliminate the $15 minimum federal wage, lower weekly unemployment benefits from $400 to $300, and limit income eligibility for stimulus checks.
&#34;You heard Sen. [Bernie] Sanders say that this was the best legislation for working people in the modern history of this country,&#34; Bedingfield said. &#34;This is a bill that reflects President Biden&#39;s belief that the best way to get the economy back on track and get it growing is to invest in working people and middle-class people.&#34;
Acknowledging support from Sanders, Tapper pointed out that other progressive Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., both have voiced criticism of the legislation.
BERNIE SANDERS AMENDMENT FOR $15 MINIMUM WAGE FAILS IN SENATE IN LONGEST VOTE IN HISTORY
And the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the bill&#39;s move to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour would violate budget rules.
Some Republicans said they would support amending the federal minimum wage to $10 an hour, and 
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.
, said he supported an $11 an hour change to the bill.
Despite claiming Biden is willing to work with Republicans, Bedingfield said that the president supports a $15 an hour hike. 
&#34;President Biden supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour,&#34; Bedingfield said. &#34;That is where he stands. That is where he stood for a long time. He believes strongly that people who are in this country who are working full time can make a living wage and not be living in poverty.&#34;
&#34;The conversation is going to turn to how we tackle the minimum wage,&#34; she continued. &#34;The president is looking forward to working with Congress to determine the best way to do it. What I can say to you right now is the president is committed to raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.&#34;
Biden cheered the passage Saturday, brushing off the lack of any GOP support in the Senate or House, and said he hasn&#39;t given up on working with Republicans on future legislation. Biden touted the relief provisions in the bill, including unemployment benefits, food aid, vaccination distribution support and the $1,400 stimulus payments. He told Americans they&#39;d be seeing those checks soon.

Bedingfield reiterated Sunday that Biden’s preference is not to end the filibuster, saying the administration would need to navigate through a 50-50 Senate. She said that although the bill was passed without any Republican support in the Senate, it did receive 75% approval from the American people &#34;including over 50% of Republicans&#34; who rallied behind Biden’s approach.
&#34;We were able to pass this legislation with massive bipartisan support across the country,&#34; she said.

West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito joins &#39;America&#39;s Newsroom&#39; to talk about Biden&#39;s infrastructure spending bill.
Chris Christie
 on Sunday accused President Biden of &#34;lying&#34; about his nearly 
$2 trillion infrastructure package
 — saying he’s calling a &#34;dog a cat&#34; because it goes far beyond rebuilding roads and bridges to include Democratic priorities like healthcare.
&#34;You cannot call a $400 billion plan to force unionization in states, to say that taking care of increasing Medicaid payments in states, is infrastructure,&#34; Christie said on 
ABC’s &#34;This Week.&#34;

&#34;Now language does matter. We learned that in the last four years. How you use it and what you say, and I said last week that the president’s not telling the truth, and he’s not telling the truth about the infrastructure package,&#34; he continued.
Christie described Biden’s infrastructure package as &#34;the care economy. This is care infrastructure.&#34;
&#34;It’s baloney,&#34; he said.
But anchor George Stephanopoulos and guest Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago, hit back that Biden’s proposals are popular and have widespread support, including from Republicans and independents.

&#34;So here’s what’s not popular. Lying is not popular. It’s not infrastructure, George,&#34; Christie said.
&#34;Do you really want to use the word ‘lie’ there?&#34; Stephanopoulos responded.
&#34;Let’s just be fair here,&#34; Christie said.
&#34;If Donald Trump had come out and called a dog a cat, which is what Joe Biden’s doing, we would be outraged by the fact that he’s lying,&#34; the former governor continued.
&#34;But with Joe Biden, somehow it’s like, ‘oh well, come on, it’s Joe.’ No, no, no, no. It’s not true.&#34;

Christie said if Biden wants to pursue increased Medicaid payments, he should &#34;make that case and see if he gets it passed.&#34;
&#34;I know he won’t, and the people around this table, whether they’ll say it or not, they know it won’t pass either,&#34; Christie stated.

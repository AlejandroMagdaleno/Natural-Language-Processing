President Biden
 in a video released told the class of 2021 they are graduating at an &#34;inflection point&#34; in history and described systemic racism as one of &#34;the great crises of our time.&#34;
In the remarks, tweeted out under his @POTUS address, Biden said that shortly after he graduated, his generation faced an inflection point -- with the Vietnam War splitting the nation and great fights for civil rights, women’s rights and environmental rights.
BIDEN SAYS, ‘I DON’T THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE RACIST,&#39; DESPITE FINDING ‘SYSTEMIC RACISM’
&#34;And now you face another inflection point,&#34; he said. &#34;As we put this pandemic behind us, rebuild our economy, root out systemic racism and tackle climate change, we’re addressing the great crises of our time with a greater sense of purpose than before. 
&#34;And because of you, your generation, I&#39;ve never been more optimistic about the future than I am today,&#34; he added.
BIDEN TELLS COAST GUARD CADETS NATION&#39;S AT ‘SIGNIFICANT INFLECTION POINT,&#39; CALL CLASS DULL AFTER JOKE BOMBS
Biden has emphasized his belief in systemic racism in the past, 
while also saying
 that he thinks that most Americans themselves are not racist.
&#34;No, I don’t think the American people are racist, but I think after 400 years, African-Americans have been left in a position where they are so far behind the eight-ball in terms of education, health, in terms of opportunity,&#34; Biden said in April.
The description of the current moment as an inflection point 
has been a regular theme
 for Biden. Speaking at the Coast Guard Academy’s campus in New London, 
Connecticut
 last month, Biden told graduates there that &#34;the world is changing. We’re at a significant inflection point,&#34; as he spotlighted &#34;disruptive nations&#34; such as China and Russia as a top challenge facing the U.S.

He stressed his optimism in his address on Saturday as he described the graduates as representing &#34;one of the most gifted and talented and well-educated generation in American history.&#34;
&#34;And you’re going to see more change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50 years -- but it’s going to be up to you to translate that unprecedented change into a greater measure of happiness and prosperity not only for you and our nation but for the world around you, and I know you will.&#34;

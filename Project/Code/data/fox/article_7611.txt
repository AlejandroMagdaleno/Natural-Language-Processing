The retired New York Jets safety outlines his coalitions plans for the new Congress on &#39;The Ingraham Angle&#39;
Rep. Burgess Owens, R-Utah, accused Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-NY, of attempting to &#34;gaslight&#34; the public after she referenced &#34;white supremacist conspiracy theories&#34; while reiterating her call for 
universal health care
.
Ocasio-Cortez is frequently identified among a group of young progressive Democratic lawmakers known as &#34;The Squad.&#34; In a Jan. 30 tweet, the New York lawmaker argued that critics have established a false equivalency between progressive policies on the far left and &#34;conspiracy theories&#34; on the far right of the political spectrum. 
&#34;Imagine thinking that ‘healthcare is a human right’ vs white supremacist conspiracy theories are two views &#39;just as extreme&#39; as the other,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez wrote in a Jan. 30 tweet.
The tweet drew a rebuke from Owens, a Black former NFL player who won a House seat last November. 
&#34;Imagine growing up dealing with the horrors of actual white supremacists, only to eventually see that term just become a way for &#39;woke&#39; Democrats to gaslight anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with them,&#34; said Owens.
Owens has frequently criticized Ocasio-Cortez and other &#34;Squad&#34; members in recent months. He has touted a group of first-term Republican lawmakers as a &#34;Freedom Force&#34; that would serve as a check against progressive political rivals.
Ocasio-Cortez has stepped up her criticism of the Republican Party after pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6. In an appearance on MSNBC last month, Ocasio-Cortez said there were &#34;legitimate white supremacist sympathizers&#34; among Republicans in the House.

Ocasio-Cortez is among several progressives who support the implementation of &#34;Medicare for All,&#34; described on her website as a &#34;universal, single-payer health care system.&#34; Republican critics have likened &#34;Medicare for All&#34; policies to socialized medicine. 
President Biden is pushing an expansion to the Affordable Care Act that would provide a &#34;public option&#34; in addition to private insurance.

FOX News Congressional Correspondent Chad Pergram has the details from Capitol Hill on &#39;Special Report&#39;
White House press secretary Jen Psaki gave the administration’s OK to House Democrats in their attempt to overturn the state-certified election in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District.
Psaki was asked by a reporter if President Biden agrees with a recent letter from Republican senators saying that Democrats&#39; attempt to take Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks&#39; seat and replace her with Democrat Rita Hart was an &#34;unacceptable attempt to undermine a legitimate democratic process.&#34; 
Biden&#39;s press secretary responded by giving the green light to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, and company to pursue overturning the result and declaring Hart the winner.  
&#34;I believe that the process that is outlined by the House of Representatives is what is being followed here to ensure every vote is counted,&#34; said Psaki. &#34;So, no, he wouldn’t agree with that.&#34;

Republicans have spoken out against the Democratic attempt to take Miller-Meeks’ seat.
The Iowa congresswoman 
defeated
 Hart in the election with a razor-thin win of six votes in a race that is still being contested, even though Iowa officially certified the election results and Miller-Meeks was provisionally sworn in as a member of Congress.
Sen. 
Joni Ernst
, R-Iowa, brought up that Hart went directly to the House Administration Committee to contest the election instead of the Iowa courts during a &#34;Fox &amp; Friends Weekend&#34; interview.
&#34;Rep. Miller-Meeks has been seated in Congress. She won this election,&#34; Ernst said. &#34;It was certified by Iowans... and now Nancy Pelosi, perhaps, will overturn it.&#34;
&#34;And that is horribly unfair to the voters in the second district in Iowa, and we are pushing back,&#34; added Ernst.
Pelosi had 
previously said
 to reporters that there was &#34;of course&#34; a situation where she saw her party swiping Miller-Meeks’ seat.

Miller-Meeks 
blasted
 the Democratic Party&#39;s ploy to pluck her House seat in a &#34;Special Report&#34; interview earlier this month.
She defended her state-certified win during the interview, saying that people everywhere in the nation should be &#34;outraged&#34; at the attempt to overturn her victory.
&#34;Everybody across the country should be outraged by this,&#34; said Miller-Meeks. &#34;I certainly have been encouraged by those people across the country who have reached out to me and told me they’re contacting their representatives to let them know their displeasure.&#34;

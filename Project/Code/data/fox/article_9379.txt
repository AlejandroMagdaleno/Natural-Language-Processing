South Dakota governor joins &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39; to explain the NCAA&#39;s role in her decision
South Dakota
 Gov. 
Kristi Noem
 defended her decision not to sign a bill banning transgender girls and women from participating in female sports in a heated exchange with Fox News host Tucker Carlson on his show Monday.
&#34;
The Tucker Carlson Tonight
&#34; host explained to viewers that the 
bill
, which is largely popular in Noem&#39;s state, nearly passed with her support until &#34;big business intercedes, [the] NCAA, Chamber of Commerce and Amazon and tell you not to sign it -- and you change your mind.&#34;
&#34;Well, that&#39;s not true, Tucker,&#34; Noem fired back. &#34;I could sign the bill the way that it is today ... but it wouldn&#39;t solve the problem.&#34;
The Republican governor said she 
returned the bill to the legislature 
over what she termed &#34;style and form,&#34; adding that she will sign it if lawmakers agree to her desired revisions.
GOV. NOEM REVERSES SUPPORT FOR BILL BANNING TRANSGENDER WOMEN FROM JOINING FEMALE SPORTS
&#34;This bill would only allow the NCAA to bully South Dakota,&#34; she said. &#34; And it would actually prevent women from being able to participate in collegiate sports. So what I have done is I have asked the legislature ... to change the bill.&#34;
Noem said the bill would allow the NCAA to take punitive action against South Dakota.
&#34;We have had to fight hard to get any tournaments to come to South Dakota,&#34; she said. &#34;When they took punitive action against us we would have to litigate, and legal scholars that I have been consulting with for many, many months say I would very likely lose those litigation efforts.&#34;
&#34;Wait,&#34; Carlson interjected. &#34;So you are saying the NCAA threatened you ... they said &#39;If you sign this, we won&#39;t allow girls in South Dakota to play&#39; and you don&#39;t think you can win in court -- even though the public overwhelmingly supports you nationally -- and so you are caving to the NCAA?&#34; he emphasized.
BIDEN TRANSGENDER POLICY MEETS BROAD STATE-BASED REPUBLICAN COUNTERATTACK
Noem dismissed Carlson&#39;s insinuation as &#34;completely wrong,&#34; and reiterated her commitment to protecting women&#39;s sports.
Her strategy, she explained, involves the creation of a coalition to keep the NCAA  from &#34;bullying the state of South Dakota.&#34;
&#34;Listen, I&#39;m sick and tired of the NCAA threatening states, challenging us and bullying us, so we are going to build a coalition of leaders, athletes and people who want to protect women&#39;s sports,&#34; she said.
When Carlson questioned why Noem doesn&#39;t take a more forceful &#34;bring it on&#34; approach to fight in the &#34;court of public opinion and defend principle,&#34; the staunch conservative responded, &#34;Tucker, you are preaching my sermon.&#34;

&#34;Listen,&#34; Noem continued. &#34;I&#39;m not interested in a participation trophy. I&#39;m not interested in picking a fight that we can&#39;t win. I am a problem-solver ... and I have been bullied for the last year by liberals, Tucker. I&#39;m not going to let anybody from the NCAA, from any big business, I&#39;m not even going to let conservatives on the right bully me. I&#39;m going to solve the problem. 
&#34;I&#39;m going to make sure that we are building strength in numbers and we are going after the NCAA and make sure that we are keeping only girls playing in girls&#39; sports.&#34;

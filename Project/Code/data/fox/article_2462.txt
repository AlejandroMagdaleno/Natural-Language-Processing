Civil rights attorney sounds off on &#39;Hannity&#39;; rips &#39;systemic racism&#39; claims.
Civil rights attorney Leo Terrell called out Democrats and far-left activists for overt racism and a continued discrimination against White Americans and White policemen.
Terrell said on &#34;Hannity&#34; the posted &#39;instructions&#39; and 
regulations for White individuals
 to access what has become George Floyd Square in Minneapolis is an &#34;insulting&#34; example of such.
&#34;That White sign that you made reference to, that sign is very, very insulting,&#34; he said. &#34;Basically, the extreme left has declared war on White Americans and White police officers.&#34;
&#34;And the Democratic leadership will not say a word because they&#39;re in bed with extreme left,&#34; said Terrell, 
a former Democrat
. &#34;That is what is going on in America. It happens not to years or four years, but it is going on 24/7, Sean Hannity.&#34;
Terrell called it incredible that Democrats cry &#34;systemic racism&#34; at times when they themselves run the  systems in areas where the purported discriminatory behavior resides.
&#34;They talk about racism. I&#39;m a civil rights attorney. I know what systemic racism is. It does not exist in Chicago, and Los Angeles, and Baltimore,&#34; he said. &#34;When the people running the show are Black people and Brown people, chief of police, they only play the White officer card against a Black victim.&#34;
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott are both African-American Democrats.

During the interview, fellow guest Candace Owens remarked that otherwise respected figures like Los Angeles Laker player LeBron James help &#34;propagate a lot of these lies&#34; -- adding that the 36-year-old lives in a multimillion-dollar mansion in a majority White neighborhood and is protected by security and police officers while publicly condemning them.
&#34;Police officers are constantly surrounding him and yet he puts out this lie. President Trump is correct to call LeBron James racist and not only that, he doesn&#39;t care about Black people.&#34;

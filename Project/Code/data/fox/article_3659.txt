White House chief medical adviser weighs in on ‘CAVUTO Live’ if people who get the coronavirus vaccine need to wear masks.
Dr. 
Anthony Fauci
, appearing frustrated with Republican criticisms, shot back at Sen. 
Lindsey Graham
, R-S.C., by saying he has &#34;nothing to do&#34; with the southern border, after Graham called on him to visit the border to see the &#34;super-spreader event&#34; occurring there.
&#34;Lindsey Graham, who I like -- he&#39;s a good person, I&#39;ve dealt with him very, very well over the years -- [is] equating me with things that have to do with the border. I have nothing to do with the border,&#34; Fauci told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto on &#34;Your World&#34; Friday. 
&#34;Obviously, it is a very difficult situation at the border. We all know that. The administration is trying as best as they can to alleviate that situation,&#34; the White House chief medical adviser said. &#34;Having me down at the border. That&#39;s really not what I do.&#34; 
&#34;Paging Dr. Fauci: You need to go to the southern border and witness in person the biggest super spreader event in the nation – President [Biden&#39;s] immigration policies,&#34; Graham tweeted Friday. 
LINDSEY GRAHAM TELLS  FAUCI TO GO TO BORDER AND SEE NATION&#39;S &#39;BIGGEST SUPERSPREADER&#39; 
Graham said thousands of migrants from Central America with a &#34;10% COVID-positive rate&#34; are spreading the virus at overcrowded border facilities. The migrants are staying &#34;on top of each other&#34; and then &#34;dumped off in Texas&#34; and other parts of the country to further the spread of coronavirus, Graham said in a multi-thread tweet. 
&#34;Dr. Fauci, does COVID-science justify President Biden’s handling of migrants from Central America?&#34; Graham tweeted. &#34;If you are worried about the spread of COVID, you should be gravely concerned about what is happening at our southern border. There is no end in sight on this super-spreader event until these policies are changed.&#34;
Fauci said he found such swipes from Republicans &#34;a little bizarre.&#34; &#34;I’ve become sort of, for some reason or another, a symbol of anything they don&#39;t like&#34; as it relates to coronavirus, the health expert said. 
&#34;Peter Navarro saying I created the virus,&#34; Fauci continued, &#34;Think about that. Neil, isn’t that a little weird? I mean, come on.&#34; 
Navarro was asked on Fox News Tuesday night about Fauci’s remark  that his decision to start working on a coronavirus vaccine in January 2020 &#34;may have been the best decision that I&#39;ve ever made.&#34;
FAUCI’S SILENCE ON BORDER CRISIS IS DEAFENING, MEADOWS SAYS
Navarro, trade adviser under former President Donald Trump, responded with a smear: &#34;Fauci is a sociopath and a liar. He had nothing to do with the vaccine. The father of the vaccine is Donald J. Trump.&#34;
&#34;What is Fauci the father of? Fauci is the father of the actual virus. ... The virus came from a Wuhan lab, basically we had Fauci funding that lab with American taxpayer dollars,&#34; Navarro said, reaching conclusions not supported by facts.
In 2014, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, the branch of the NIH headed by Fauci, awarded a $3.4 million grant to the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance. That group then hired the Wuhan Institute of Virology to conduct analyses of bat coronaviruses. EcoHealth Alliance paid the lab $598,500 over five years. The lab had earned approval from both the State Department and the NIH.

Former House Speaker says Democrats are trying to create an &#39;alternate America&#39; on &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39;
House Democrats
 are engaged in a &#34;cynical ploy&#34; to pass as much of their extreme agenda as they can before next year&#39;s midterm elections, former 
House Speaker
 Newt Gingrich told &#34;
Tucker Carlson Tonight
&#34; Wednesday.
&#34;I think ... they&#39;ve given up on keeping the House, Gingrich explained. &#34;What they&#39;re doing is ramming through everything they can get done before they lose in 2022. This is kind of a sprint to radicalism even though it&#39;s going to cost, if you look at these votes ... [they&#39;ll] have 30, 40, 50 members who are not going to be able to defend them.&#34;
Gingrich noted that the last two Democratic presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, both saw their party suffer huge losses in the House in their first midterm election. 
&#34;They [Democrats] lost 54 seats [in 1994] and we became the majority for the first time in 40 years,&#34; he said. &#34;When Obama was elected, they lost 63 seats [in 2010].&#34;
&#34;I think the Biden-Harris model is, &#39;We&#39;re going to lose the House anyway, we might as well grab everything we can while we&#39;ve got power. &#39;It&#39;s astonishing,&#34; Gingrich went on.
&#34;Just take the $1.9 trillion political pork bill, which is not a COVID bill. Only 9% of it is COVID. The other 91% is just political pork. That bill has more radicalism in it than the eight years of Clinton and the eight years of Obama combined. Just that one vote.&#34;

&#34;And you&#39;re going to see wave after wave. I describe it as a flood tide of radicalism,&#34; he added, later claiming that the Democrats&#39; insistence on essentially erasing the U.S.-Mexico border makes those flooding into the country &#34;Biden&#39;s illegals.&#34;
&#34;If there&#39;s a problem in Texas, it&#39;s not with Governor Abbott, it&#39;s with Biden&#39;s illegals. We just have to call them [that], these are Biden&#39;s illegals coming into the country [with] no public health check,&#34; Gingrich said. &#34;Even back in the 1880s we had public-health checks when you came to America.&#34;

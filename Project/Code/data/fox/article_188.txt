Recipient of sentence commutation by outgoing president tells &#39;The Story&#39; who deserves a second chance
Alice Marie Johnson, the Tennessee grandmother whose life sentence on a federal drug charge was commuted by 
President Trump
, told Fox News Tuesday that the outgoing president should pardon more &#34;nonviolent drug offenders&#34; before 
Joe Biden
 is sworn in Wednesday.
With the president expected to release a list of clemency recipients before the end of Tuesday, Johnson told &#34;
The Story
&#34; that she had been lobbying for clemency for &#34;offenders that have been serving draconian sentences.&#34;
&#34;I believe I made some very good headway,&#34; Johnson told host Martha MacCallum. &#34;There&#39;s others that I have been asking for that have had their sentences way too long.&#34;
She went on to praise Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner and first daughter Ivanka Trump for their efforts in helping to give former inmates a &#34;second chance.&#34;

Johnson told MacCallum she submitted a list of close to 100 convicts that Trump should consider for clemency, while cautioning it was unlikely all of them will be reprieved.

&#34;She&#39;s really stepped in and just raised the bar of being a hard-working person that wants to make sure that as many receive their freedom today as possible.&#34;
Trump has already granted pardons to his 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort Jr., as well as Republican political consultant Roger J. Stone and Jared Kushner&#39;s father, Charles.

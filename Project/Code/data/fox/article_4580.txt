A 
Missouri
 school district announced Tuesday that racist graffiti found in a high school bathroom was part of a &#34;hate hoax&#34; carried out by a non-white student.
The racist graffiti sparked a walkout by the students at Parkway Central High School in St. Louis County,  Missouri in September but the school district now says that the messages, which included a racial slur against black people and a statement wishing for the death of black people, were put there by a non-white student.

&#34;The student responsible is not white,&#34; Supt. Keith Marty said in a 
statement
. &#34;This does not diminish the hurt it caused or the negative impact it has had on our entire community.&#34;
&#34;The student is facing severe disciplinary consequences and referral to law enforcement for investigation,&#34; Marty added. &#34;Parkway will continue to hold students responsible for any behavior that threatens or degrades others in our school community.&#34;
Marty added that there is work to be done at the school district to promote inclusivity.

Marty did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News.

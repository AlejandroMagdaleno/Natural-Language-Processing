The 
Senate
 Thursday confirmed educator Gayle Manchin, the wife of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of 
West Virginia
, to serve as federal co-chair of the Appalachian Regional Commission.
Gayle Manchin’s appointment to the post was confirmed via unanimous consent. President Biden nominated her for the position, which pays an annual salary of roughly $163,000, according to a federal database.
Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat, has emerged as a key voter as the Biden administration attempts to enact its agenda with a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate. The West Virginia senator’s support is critical to Biden’s push to pass legislation on infrastructure, tax reform and other initiatives that will require unanimous support within the party.
The senator has notably broken with his party on several initiatives favored by progressives, including a push for a $15 federal minimum wage and calls to abolish the filibuster.
The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership to boost economic development across 13 states stretching from Georgia to New York.

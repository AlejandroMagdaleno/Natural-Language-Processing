Fox News contributor Miranda Devine reacts to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo apologizing but refusing to resign.
New York
 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo&#39;s
 hopes of winning a fourth term and potentially running for president have been &#34;shattered&#34; by the nursing home and sexual harassment scandals, Fox News contributor Miranda Devine said Thursday.
&#34;He’s really on a road to nowhere, but he obviously has told us that he’s going to dig in, and really I can’t see anybody managing to dislodge him before the next election next year,&#34; Devine, a New York Post columnist, told &#34;
America Reports
&#34;. &#34;But any hopes of a fourth term are shattered, as are his presidential ambitions.&#34;
Devine said Cuomo’s emotional apology, which he made during a news conference Wednesday, &#34;did not seem genuine.&#34;
&#34;If there was any remorse yesterday -- he seemed to be a little bit teary-eyed at one point, although it did not seem very genuine -- any remorse was for himself and his shattered ambitions,&#34; she said.
CUOMO APOLOGIZES BUT WON’T RESIGN AS HE DENIES TOUCHING ANYONE &#39;INAPPROPRIATELY&#39;: &#39;I AM EMBARRASSED’
Cuomo apologized for his past behavior following allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior by three women. The governor told reporters that he is &#34;embarrassed&#34; by his actions and will cooperate with New York Attorney General Letitia James&#39; investigation of his conduct.
&#34;I now understand that I acted in a way that made people feel uncomfortable. It was unintentional and I truly and deeply apologize for it,&#34; Cuomo said. &#34;I feel awful about it and frankly I am embarrassed by it.&#34;
Cuomo went on to say that he &#34;never knew at the time I was making anyone feel uncomfortable,&#34; that he has &#34;learned an important lesson,&#34; and &#34;will be the better for this experience.&#34;

Devine ripped Cuomo for having &#34;no remorse and no apology for the families of those 10,000 coronavirus-infected people that were sent into nursing homes, causing the death of more than 15,000 people.&#34;
&#34;His own aide has admitted that they covered up [the death toll] and that they didn’t provide information requested by state legislators because they were hiding it from the feds,&#34; she said. 
&#34;I don’t see how he can escape from culpability for that. At the moment, this sexual harassment scandal is causing him more grief, and he is certainly getting a lot more criticism for that. People are coming out of the woodwork now. But, you know, the deaths of all those people last year, you wonder, &#39;Where were his critics then?&#39;&#34;

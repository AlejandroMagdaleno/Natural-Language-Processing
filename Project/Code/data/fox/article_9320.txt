Michael Wasserman wants to let his 
freedom
 fly — but his town of Long Beach, 
New York
, isn’t having it.
&#34;I believe the city is trying to silence me because I’m pro-
Trump
,&#34; he told The Post.
The 62-year-old entrepreneur has become known in the area for plastering his home — along with his Porsche and Jeep — with a rotating variety of political flags and stickers.
Now he has filed a 
$25 million federal suit
 — against the 
City of Long Beach
, the chief of police, the city manager and specific police officers — after officials forced him to remove the flags on his cars.
The town claims they are a violation of an ordinance stating that &#34;[No] sign shall be erected, affixed or maintained within the perimeter of any … public street or public property.&#34; Wasserman parks his car on a public street outside his home.

&#34;They’re bending and massaging the ordinance to fit the crime,&#34; Wasserman told The Post. &#34;This is a blatant attempt to silence me.&#34;
&#34;They’re bending and massaging the ordinance to fit the crime. This is a blatant attempt to silence me.&#34;
The town’s lawyer, Howard M. Miller, told The Post: &#34;It’s not a political case. It’s not the contents of the message. it’s where he had it — it’s a public street.&#34;
Wasserman — who said police have visited his home multiple times since March, giving reasons from neighbor complaints to violation of ordinances — believes he is targeted for being a conservative.
&#34;[People] spit at me, drive by cursing me out,&#34; he said of local residents. His Porsche, which is decorated with  stickers — including one depicting Trump urinating on a CNN logo — is marred with scratches from people keying it.
But, he said, all the hate only strengthens his resolve.
&#34;If they didn’t try to cancel me, I probably wouldn’t be so prolific,&#34; Wasserman told The Post, wearing a legally permitted gun, a $400 Kevlar bulletproof vest and a body camera because of &#34;death notes on my car.&#34;

&#34;There’s so much vitriol, hate and anger from [liberals],&#34; he added. &#34;Aren’t they supposed to be inclusive of everyone? They’re not.&#34;
Lawyer Victor Feraru, a self-described &#34;liberal Democrat&#34; who said he has taken heat for representing Wasserman, told The Post that they are suing on the grounds of selective enforcement and discrimination.
&#34;We wouldn’t be here if he were flying a Biden flag,&#34; Feraru said. &#34;This is … selective targeting for his political ideology.&#34;
A pre-motion hearing is pending, and Wasserman’s team expects defendants to file a motion to dismiss.

A longtime Democrat, Wasserman switched parties in 2004 to vote for George W. Bush. He said he’s been flying flags for over a decade, including Tea Party flags, Marine flags, pro-cop flags and the Gadsden (&#34;Don’t Tread on Me&#34;) flag, which started as an anti-British sentiment during the Revolutionary War but has become controversial in recent years.
When The Post visited Thursday, he was flying &#34;F–- Biden&#34; banners, the profanity of which has caused neighbors to complain to police. 
The town 
admitted 
in a March 21 statement that the &#34;profane language .. is considered  constitutionally protected.&#34;
But Wasserman won’t be stopped.
&#34;I’m standing up for my constitutional liberties,&#34; said Wasserman. &#34;All they try to do is cancel you.&#34;

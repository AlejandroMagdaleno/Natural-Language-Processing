FOX News host Shannon Bream reacts to the breaking news on &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39;
Sen. Tom Cotton,
 a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, took to Twitter late Wednesday to excoriate Democrats over their 
soon-to-be-announced plan 
to expand the number of justices on the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The move, although dramatic, has been somewhat expected. 
COTTON: EVERY COP IN AMERICA SHOULD BE AFRAID OF BIDEN&#39;S DOJ PICK
During the 2020 presidential campaign, then-candidate Joe Biden was criticized by Republicans for appearing elusive when asked about whether he would pack the court. Biden said he would tell Americans after the election his position but eventually said that he is &#34;not a fan&#34; of the idea.
In January, he announced 
that a bipartisan group

Cotton, who was once reportedly considered for the High Court during Donald Trump’s presidency, tweeted that packing the bench would &#34;destroy&#34; the institution. 
&#34;The Democrats will do anything for power,&#34; he posted. Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff, also tweeted, &#34;The moderate left is gone.&#34;
&#34;This is who they are now,&#34; he posted. &#34;Open borders. Outlawing voter ID. Free healthcare for illegal migrants. And now court packing.&#34;

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the commission a &#34;direct assault on our nation&#39;s independent judiciary.&#34;

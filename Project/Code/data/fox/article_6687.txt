North Carolina
 lawmakers killed a 
bill
 this week that would have repealed a more-than-a-century-old law that allows people to sue their 
spouse’s
 lover for &#34;alienation of affection,&#34; according to reports.
Members of the House judiciary committee split 4-4 Wednesday on whether to advance the bill, with some of those in favor of keeping it arguing its repeal would be &#34;legalizing adultery,&#34; according to the News &amp; Observer in Raleigh. 
North Carolina is one of only a handful of states that have similar laws.
State Rep. Wesley Harris, a Democrat who sponsored the bill, contended the law was both &#34;archaic and antiquated.&#34; 
&#34;This was started in the 1700s in Great Britain when women were still treated as property of their husbands,&#34; he said, according to WRAL-TV in Raleigh.

Jere Royall, director of community impact and counsel for the North Carolina Family Policy Council, disagreed.
&#34;We believe that the state&#39;s policy should remain clear – that marriages are worth protecting ... and that a third party who has committed adultery will be held accountable and liable for their actions,&#34; he said, according to WRAL.
The Rev. Mark Creech, executive director of the Christian Action League of North Carolina, said the law was an &#34;effective deterrent to home-wrecking.&#34;
In the hearing, Rep. Jon Hardister, a Republican who supported repealing the law, said, &#34;I want to preserve marriages as much as the next person, but it is between two spouses.&#34;
State Rep. Billy Richardson, a Democrat, said the &#34;cruel and harsh&#34; law is often misused by divorce lawyers as  &#34;blackmail&#34; to get a better settlement, 
WRAL 
reported.
Last month, former state Sen. Rick Gunn settled a lawsuit brought by the husband of his then-legislative assistant who accused the two of having an affair, the 
News &amp; Observer
 reported.

President Biden
 in Memorial Day remarks Monday asked Americans not only to remember the &#34;sacrifice&#34; and &#34;valor&#34; of American military members who died in service but also their &#34;humanity&#34; and &#34;precious life.&#34; 
The president lauded the United States&#39; fallen service members as &#34;those who gave their all in the service of America, in the service of freedom, in the service of justice.&#34;
&#34;Remember their sacrifice, their valor and their grace. Remember their smiles, their loves, their laughter, their essential vibrant and transcendent humanity,&#34; Biden added. &#34;For while we stand amid monuments of stone, we must never forget that each of these markers, for those known and unknown, here at Arlington and far beyond, represent a precious life. A son, a daughter, a mother, a spouse, brother, a sister, a friend, a neighbor.&#34;
Biden made the comments shortly after a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery at which he was joined by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Vice President Kamala Harris and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley.

Biden appeared to pray over the wreath for a few moments before it was laid at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. 
According to the 
Congressional Research Service
 (CRS)
, more than 1 million American service members have died in the history of the United States, dating back to the Revolutionary War. The deadliest conflicts were the Civil War and World War II, which killed more than 400,000 Americans each. 
The United States&#39; most recent war, the Global War on Terror, has killed more than 6,900 American service members, according to the 
CRS
. Biden said on Monday that the exact total is now 7,036 who each &#34;leave behind an entire community and family.&#34;
Later in the speech, Biden warned that &#34;democracy itself is in peril here at home and around the world.&#34; 
&#34;The soul of America is animated by the perennial battle between our worst instincts, which we&#39;ve seen of late, and our better angels,&#34; Biden said. &#34;Between ‘me first’ and ‘we the people.’ Between greed and generosity. Cruelty and kindness. Captivity and freedom.&#34;
&#34;These Americans weren&#39;t fighting for dictators. They were fighting for democracy. They weren&#39;t fighting to exclude and enslave. They were fighting to build and broaden and liberate,&#34; Biden added. &#34;They weren&#39;t fighting for self. They were fighting for the soul of the nation. For liberty and simple fair play.&#34;
The president continued to say that &#34;What we do now ... how we honor the memory of the fallen, will determine whether or not democracy will long endure.&#34; As during the campaign, Biden said that the U.S. is in the midst of a &#34;struggle for the soul of America itself.&#34;

&#34;Democracy thrives when the infrastructure of democracy is strong. When people have the right to vote, freely and fairly and conveniently,&#34; Biden said. &#34;When a free and independent press pursues the truth, founded on facts, not propaganda, when the rule of law applies equally and fairly to every citizen regardless of where they come from or what they look like.&#34;
Biden also on Monday referenced the death of his son Beau Biden, a veteran, as he sympathized with the loved ones of those who have died while fighting on behalf of the country. Beau Biden died of cancer in 2015 at the age of 46.

&#34;To those who mourn a loved one today, Jill and I have some idea how you&#39;re feeling. Our losses are not the same. But that black hole that you feel in your chest as it&#39;s going to suck you into it, we get,&#34; Biden said, referring to first lady Jill Biden. &#34;Our son Beau&#39;s service in the Delaware National Guard unit, the year he spent deployed in Iraq, was one of the things that he was most proud of in life.&#34;
&#34;We will never forget what you gave to our country,&#34; Biden said to families of the fallen. &#34;We will never fail to honor your sacrifice.&#34; 
&#34;Every day is Memorial Day for the families of our fallen,&#34; Milley also said Monday.

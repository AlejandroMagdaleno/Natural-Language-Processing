FLORIDA HONORING RUSH LIMBAUGH BY LOWERING FLAGS TO HALF-STAFF: DESANTIS
As 
previously reported by Fox News

DeSantis called him a friend. It’s not clear when the flags will be lowered, since the funeral plans for Limbaugh have not been announced yet.

Limbaugh found out he had stage-four lung cancer in January 2020. President Donald Trump awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, during his 2020 State of the Union Address. 
Limbaugh’s death has been widely mourned by conservatives, although critics have highlighted past comments by him that they allege were bigoted.

Navy Commander J.H. Furman joins &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39; and speaks out against forced vaccinations, says impacts of the vaccine are unknown
A federal appeals judge has blocked a New York City COVID-19 mandate, set to take effect on Monday, from being enforced on teachers and other staff members in the NYC Department of Education.
Prior to the judge&#39;s action out of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, it was reported that Department of Education employees who had not yet received their first dose of the vaccine before end of day on Monday could be separated or suspended without pay.

Regarding the ruling, the Department of Education released the following statement: &#34;We’re confident our vaccine mandate will continue to be upheld once all the facts have been presented, because that is the level of protection our students and staff deserve. Our current vax-or-test mandate remains in effect and we’re seeking speedy resolution by the Circuit Court next week. Over 82 percent of DOE employees have been vaccinated and we continue to urge all employees to get their shot by September 27.&#34;
According to data from the Department of Education, 82% of some 150,000 DOE employees, including 88% of teachers and 95% of principals are vaccinated. The United Federation of Teachers has also stated that approximately 95% of their members are vaccinated.
Amid the looming vaccine mandate and fear of staffing shortages, the Department of Education will begin preparing &#34;emergency meals&#34; for students at &#34;some locations if staffing is an issue,&#34; as reported by

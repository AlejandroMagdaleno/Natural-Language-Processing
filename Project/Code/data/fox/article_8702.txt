The Texas lawmaker blasts the FAA For blocking drone footage of the ‘horrific’ number of migrants under the Del Rio, TX bridge. 
FIRST ON FOX: 
Republican Sen. 
Ted Cruz
 of Texas challenged &#34;Squad&#34; queen Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y., to &#34;cry in front of the Biden cages&#34; as the crisis at the southern border continues to rage.
In a phone interview with Fox News, the senator ripped into 
President Biden&#39;s
 handling of the border crisis before blasting Ocasio-Cortez for the crying photo she took near a Texas border facility under former 
President Trump
. 
The senator challenged Biden, Ocasio-Cortez, Vice President Harris and other Democrats to travel to the southern border and see the &#34;Biden cages&#34; for themselves.
BORDER PATROL STUNNED AS BIDEN GOES TO WAR WITH HIS OWN AGENTS OVER FALSE ‘WHIPPING’ ALLEGATIONS
&#34;I challenge every one of them: I challenge Biden, I challenge Harris, I challenge AOC, who famously had a picture of her pretending to cry in front of a cage with children,&#34; Cruz said. &#34;Come down to the Biden cages now, which are bigger and more full.&#34;
&#34;Let’s see AOC cry in front of the Biden cages. Let’s see Joe Biden or Kamala Harris or [White House press secretary] Jen Psaki say &#39;there is no border crisis’ as we stand in front of the Biden cages,&#34; the senator continued.
&#34;They are lying and they’re counting on the media to cover up their lies, and it’s incredibly cynical and it’s wrong,&#34; he added.
The Texas senator also noted in the interview that the &#34;manmade&#34; crisis could be alleviated by going &#34;back to the policies that work&#34; that were instituted under the president’s predecessor.
Cruz also torched the president for &#34;attacking the 
Border Patrol
, vowing that they will pay for doing their job&#34; as well as &#34;repeating the outright lie that they were carrying whips&#34; when the agents were carrying horse reins, calling it a &#34;low point, even for this White House.&#34;
&#34;I’m proud to know quite a few heroes in our Border Patrol, and, even before Biden’s slander, they were demoralized and dispirited because under the Biden-Harris administration, they risk their lives to apprehend drug traffickers and human traffickers only to see their political superiors release them through the revolving door of Biden’s open borders.&#34;

&#34;Now, not only are they having their work undermined, but Biden is threatening political retribution because the open-border radicals in the Democratic Party believe that the Border Patrol are what [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi calls them: stormtroopers, analogizing them to Nazi soldiers.&#34;
&#34;That is grotesquely unfair. It is wrong, destructive -- I am amazed that every Border Patrol agent in America doesn’t say ‘to hell with it’ and refuse to come back to work,&#34; Cruz continued, noting that agents both young and old are &#34;quitting&#34; the Border Patrol.
Neither Ocasio-Cortez’s office nor the White House immediately responded to Fox News’ requests for comment.

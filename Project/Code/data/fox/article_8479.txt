St. John’s professor Richard Taylor and his attorney Ronald G. Russo discuss suing St. Johns University.
A former St. John’s University professor has sued the 
school
 over his &#34;disheartening&#34; discharge related to racism claims.
The New York Post 
reported
 that Richard Taylor, a 46-year-old Ph.D. student and adjunct history professor at the St. John’s Queen&#39;s campus, was fired because of a misinterpreted question that was posed during a lesson involving slavery.
STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS STRUGGLE AMID PANDEMIC
&#34;At least one student filed a bias complaint last fall against Richard Taylor, 46, a Ph.D. student and adjunct history professor at the St. John’s Queens campus. The student reportedly said Taylor wanted students to justify slavery during a September lesson on the impact of globalization in the 15th and 16th centuries,&#34; the Post reported.
The cop-turned-professor told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
&#34; that there is &#34;no proof&#34; that he is a racist and that was not the question that he asked.
&#34;The question that the students were asked is &#39;do the positives outweigh the negatives for the meeting of the Old World and the New World?&#39; It was not a question about slavery,&#34; Taylor said, adding that he was immediately removed from teaching his class without a hearing or a discussion with administrators.
A petition in support of Taylor from past students was signed by more than 500 of them, Taylor noted.
&#34;Nobody can justify slavery and I stressed that in the class during the lesson when students objected,&#34; he explained.
Although there were 300 complaints filed against Taylor, he said that couldn’t have been possible because there are only 29 students in his class.
Taylor’s lawyer and a graduate of St. John&#39;s, Ronald G. Russo, said that the professor was discharged based on complaints from a group called SJU Radicals. He said only one student in Taylor&#39;s class complained.

&#34;How could you rely on 300 complaints from people who were not in [Taylor&#39;s] class, who may not have been students at St. John’s. This can’t stand,&#34; Russo said.
In a statement to Fox News on Taylor&#39;s firing, St. John&#39;s University stressed the need for &#34;respect for all people&#34; during &#34;vigorous&#34; classroom debates.

House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 predicted Friday that Democrats will retain control of the 
House
 in 2022 despite projections of a GOP takeover.

Pelosi&#39;s comments came in response to reports that even the Democrats&#39; campaign chief warned that if elections were held now, Republicans would win back the House. 
Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), told a closed-door lunch last week that the party needs to course-correct ahead of 2022 to better promote President Biden&#39;s agenda or else they&#39;ll lose,

&#34;I always run from behind,&#34; Pelosi said.

a new national podcast
 this week. Pelosi and Biden were both buoyed by a 
positive jobs report
 on Friday that showed U.S. employers added 943,000 workers to their payrolls and the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%.
Pelosi said the &#34;big number&#34;  is &#34;decisive proof that the Biden administration and the Democrats&#39; Build Back Better economy is working.&#34;

Ryder Trauma Center surgeon Dr. Howard Lieberman describes the scene at the condo collapse site in Surfside, Florida, after spending every day assisting in rescue efforts
Florida
 Gov. 
Ron DeSantis
 pushed back against a 
media
 report that he asked former President 
Donald Trump
 to cancel a planned Florida rally while 
search and rescue
 efforts continue at 
Surfside
. 
&#34;There was never, at any time, a ‘plea’ from Gov. DeSantis or anyone on his team to cancel or postpone the rally,&#34; Christina Pushaw, the governor&#39;s press secretary told Fox News. &#34;This confusion could have been cleared up very easily – and I believe it has been, with our unequivocal statements on the record.&#34; 
Pushaw insists that the governor’s office was not given enough time to respond to the claim, leading to an &#34;inaccurate headline.&#34; 
The Washington Examiner 
ran an article
 Wednesday that claimed DeSantis and Trump were in a &#34;feud&#34; over Trump’s July 4 rally: The report claimed that DeSantis made a &#34;plea&#34; for Trump to postpone the event, to be held in Sarasota. 
&#34;The Washington Examiner reporter who wrote it neglected to contact me until an hour before her deadline, and she did not get a comment from the governor’s political team at all before publication,&#34; Pushaw continued. 
SURFSIDE CONDO MANAGER COMPLAINED OF REPAIR DELAYS JUST DAYS BEFORE COLLAPSE: ‘THIS IS HOLDING US UP’
The proximity of the rally to the deadly partial collapse of the Champlain Towers condo tower in Surfside struck a nerve with some. 
POLITICAL CARTOON OF THE DAY: THE OL&#39; BALL AND CHAIN
The governor’s office said DeSantis would have joined the rally under normal circumstances, but that his duty is &#34;to be in Surfside, making sure the families and community have what they need in the aftermath of this tragic building collapse.&#34;

Former President Donald Trump announced Wednesday the forthcoming &#34;TRUTH Social,&#34; a social media network that aims to &#34;stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech.&#34;
The app, which will begin a beta launch for invited guests in November 2021, is expected to make its full debut within the first quarter of 2022 and is a part of the newly established Trump Media &amp; Technology Group (TMTG).

Trump, who will serve as chairman of TMTG, released a statement announcing the planned arrival of the platform and insisted the effort will push back against platforms that lean left and that it will &#34;give a voice to all.&#34;
&#34;I created TRUTH Social and TMTG to stand up to the tyranny of Big Tech,&#34; Trump said. &#34;We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favorite American President has been silenced. This is unacceptable&#34;

&#34;I am excited to send out my first TRUTH on TRUTH Social very soon,&#34; Trump added. &#34;TMTG was founded with a mission to give a voice to all. I&#39;m excited to soon begin sharing my thoughts on TRUTH Social and to fight back against Big Tech. Everyone asks me why doesn&#39;t someone stand up to Big Tech? Well, we will be soon!&#34;

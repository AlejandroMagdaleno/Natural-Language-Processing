Jamie Metzl tells &#39;The Ingraham Angle&#39; why a full investigation is needed despite China&#39;s bullying
Secretary of State 
Antony Blinken
 on Sunday admitted that the coronavirus &#34;got out of hand faster&#34; because of China.
During an interview on NBC&#39;s 
&#34;Meet the Press&#34;
 Blinken told anchor 
Chuck Todd
 that China &#34;didn&#39;t do what it needed to do&#34; in the early stages of the pandemic in response to a question about whether he believes China knows the origin of the coronavirus.
SCIENTISTS SLAM WHO-CHINA REPORT, DEMAND &#39;FULL INVESTIGATION&#39; INTO COVID-19 ORIGINS
&#34;I think China knows that in the early stages of Covid, it didn&#39;t do what it needed to do, which was to, in real time, give access to international experts, in real time to share information, in real time to provide real transparency,&#34; Blinken said.

Blinken continued by saying that a &#34;result of that failure&#34; is that the the pandemic &#34;got out of hand faster and with, I think, much more egregious results than it might otherwise.&#34;
Last month, a draft copy of a joint 
World Health Organization
 and China study 
found
 that the origin of Covid-19 likely stemmed from the transmission of the virus from bats to humans through another animal.
GOP CONGRESSMAN CALLS ON BLINKEN TO DEMAND COVID REPARATIONS FROM CHINA
Blinken expressed &#34;real concerns about the methodology and the process that went into that report, including the fact that the government in Beijing apparently helped to write it,&#34; Axios 
reported
 last month.
Republican Study Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., in a letter last month 
called
 on Blinken to demand China give the United States reparations for the economic damange they caused with their handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

&#34;China must pay the burden and the cost endured by Americans because of their role in this pandemic,&#34; Banks wrote to Blinken.
&#34;Preventing another pandemic is a goal that we all share, but giving China a slap on the wrist after it continued to lie to the world and heightened the severity of the current pandemic is only going to make that goal harder to achieve,&#34; he added.

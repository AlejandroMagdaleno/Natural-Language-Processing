Two workers in 
Fulton County, Georgia
 have been fired after they were accused of shredding hundreds of voter registration applications, spurring Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to call for a U.S. Department of Justice investigation.
&#34;After 20 years of documented failure in Fulton County elections, Georgians are tired of waiting to see what the next embarrassing revelation will be,&#34; 
Raffensperger said in a press release Monday.
 &#34;The Department of Justice needs to take a long look at what Fulton County is doing and how their leadership disenfranchises Fulton voters through incompetence and malfeasance. The voters of Georgia are sick of Fulton County’s failures.&#34;

The two unidentified employees are accused of shredding batches of applications the county received instead of properly processing them, according to a release from Fulton County Registration and Elections Director Richard Barron.
The allegations come just three weeks before Fulton County residents are set to vote in 
municipal elections
, with all of the shredded applications being received in the last two weeks.
The two workers were reported by fellow employees Friday and were terminated later that day.
&#34;Elections are the most important function of our government,&#34; Fulton County Commission Chairman Robb Pitts said in the release. &#34;We have committed to transparency and integrity.&#34;
In addition to the calls for a federal investigation, Raffensperger said the secretary of state&#39;s office has also already launched an investigation into the incident.

The secretary of state added that the review &#34;could lead to a replacement of the leadership of Fulton County&#39;s elections&#34; under Georgia&#39;s new election integrity law.

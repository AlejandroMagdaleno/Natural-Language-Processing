Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell says the Senate will not be able to function without the filibuster. 
Senate
 Minority Leader 
Mitch McConnell
, R-Ky., said on Wednesday that 
Democrats
 were not given a &#34;mandate&#34; by the American people to eliminate the filibuster in order to completely &#34;transform&#34; this country.
McConnell, during an appearance on 
&#34;The Faulkner Focus,&#34;
 said that some Democrats are prepared to &#34;steamroll&#34; the Senate into a majoritarian body, like the 
House of Representatives,
 by eliminating the filibuster because it is an &#34;inconvenience&#34; their ability to push through progressive legislation. 
&#34;So I guess where [Democrats] stand depends on where they sit,&#34; McConnell told 
Harris Faulkner.
 &#34;When they’re in a position to advance the ball they don’t care.&#34;
McConnell said that the Senate should operate differently than the House, functioning not as a &#34;speedway&#34; to pass far-left bills, but as a forum to &#34;kill bad ideas&#34; and inspire thoughtful bipartisan discussion.
DEMOCRATS HATE FILIBUSTER NOW BUT USED IT TO BLOCK GOP LEGISLATION UNDER TRUMP
McConnell 
threatened
 on Tuesday to turn the Senate into a &#34;100-car pileup&#34; and block &#34;even the most basic aspects&#34; of its function if Democrats get rid of the legislative filibuster.
&#34;So let me say this very clearly for all 99 of my colleagues. Nobody serving in this chamber can even begin to imagine what a completely scorched-earth Senate would look like,&#34; McConnell said. 
&#34;None of us have served one minute in a Senate that was completely drained of comity and consent. This is an institution that requires unanimous consent to turn the lights on before noon, to proceed with a garden-variety floor speech.&#34;
McConnell continued: &#34;I want our colleagues to imagine a world where every single task, every one of them, requires a physical quorum. Which, by the way, the vice president does not count in determining a quorum. This chaos would not open up an express lane for liberal change ... The Senate would be more like a 100-car pileup, nothing moving.&#34;

This proposal would end the ability of a minority to stop any legislation and essentially set up a test of wills between the minority and majority over whether a certain piece of legislation passes.

Texas Republican joins &#39;The Ingraham Angle&#39; to discuss &#39;woke&#39; corporations alienating half of America
Rep. 
Dan Crenshaw
, R-
Texas
, said he underwent emergency surgery Friday for a detached retina in his left eye and will be unable to see as he recovers.
&#34;The surgery went well, but I will be effectively blind for about a month,&#34; Crenshaw said in a Twitter statement on Saturday.

Crenshaw, a U.S. Navy SEAL veteran, lost his right eye during a deployment in Afghanistan when he was wounded by an improvised explosive device (IED) and wears a patch on that eye.
But his left eye also sustained damage in the 2012 blast, and he learned this week that the problems had gotten worse.
&#34;This is a terrifying prognosis for someone with one eye, and the nature of the injuries that I sustained in Afghanistan,&#34; Crenshaw said. &#34;Anyone who knows the history of my injuries knows that I don’t have a ‘good eye’, but half a good eye.

&#34;The blast from 2012 caused a cataract, excessive tissue damage, and extensive damage to my retina,&#34; he continued. &#34;It was always a possibility that the effects of the damage to my retina would surface, and it appears that is exactly what has happened. The prognosis I received Thursday is obviously very bad.&#34;
Crenshaw said he&#39;s home recovering in Houston and has to lie face-down -- unable to see anything -- as he recovers.

Radio host Ty Smith says CRT &#39;teaches kids how to hate each other&#39;
Senator 
Ted Cruz
 on Friday blasted 
critical race theory
 as a &#34;lie&#34; and said the school of thought is as racist as &#34;the Klansman in white sheets.&#34;
The 
Texas
 Republican took the stage at the Faith and Freedom Foundation&#39;s Road to the Majority 
conference
 where he took critical race theory head-on, recalling a reporter who he said tried to &#34;gotcha&#34; the senator about &#34;what is critical race theory.&#34;
&#34;I explained to him and I said, ‘Well, it’s a theory that derives from Marxism. Carl Marx viewed the entire world as a conflict between classes, between the owners of capital and the working men and women, the proletariat,&#34; Cruz said. &#34;A fundamental battle in society.&#34;
&#34;Critical race theory takes that same Marxist concept except it replaces ‘class’ with ‘race,’&#34; he continued. &#34;And it says all of America and all of the world is a battle between the races.&#34;

Cruz said that critical race theory &#34;seeks to turn us against each other&#34; and looks to stoke hatred among people if they have &#34;different-colored skin.&#34;
&#34;And let me tell you right now: critical race theory is bigoted. It is a lie,&#34; the Texas Republican continued, sparking cheers from the crowd. &#34;And it is every bit as racist as the Klansman in white sheets.&#34;
The senator said that, &#34;as a Christian and an American,&#34; he loves his neighbor regardless of the color of their skin, sex, faith, creed or ethnicity, adding that &#34;we are commanded to love.&#34;

&#34;Period. The end,&#34; Cruz said. &#34;And those who would divide us, those who would spread lies. It is evil.&#34;
The debate over critical race theory has largely focused on critical race theory&#39;s role in schools, leading some Republican states to 
take steps
 to 
ban it
 from public schools.

West Virginia senator breaks down partisan COVID relief bill, president&#39;s cabinet nominees, and hopes for bipartisanship on &#39;Special Report.&#39; 
President Biden
 will sign the $1.9 trillion
 coronavirus relief bill 
on Friday afternoon, said White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced, who called it the &#34;most progressive bill in American history.&#34; 
The House passed the sweeping legislation on Wednesday 220 to 211, after the Senate passed it on Saturday. No Republicans voted &#34;yes&#34; on the legislation. 
&#34;We, of course, are moving full speed ahead on the implementation of the bill,&#34; Psaki said. 
HOUSE PASSES LANDMARK $1.9T COVID BILL, DELIVERS BIDEN FIRST LEGISLATIVE WIN 
The bill means more money in Americans&#39; pockets is on the horizon. The &#34;American Rescue Plan&#34; calls for $
1,400 stimulus checks
 for individuals earning up to $75,000 and $2,800 checks for couples earning $150,000 or under. Households will receive an additional $1,400 for each dependent child. 
For the unemployed, the legislation extends $300-per-week enhanced federal benefits through Sept. 6 and allows the first $10,200 of jobless benefits to be tax-free to households with incomes under $150,000.
THIRD STIMULUS CHECK: WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE MONEY, AND WHO ISN&#39;T?
And unlike past coronavirus relief bills, this legislation establishes a &#34;
child allowance
&#34; worth upwards of $300 per month for each child under the age of six, or $3,600 a year. For older children up to age 17, families would get $3,000 a year in the new child tax credit program.
Republicans said the legislation was unnecessary, too big and filled with 
unrelated liberal priorities
, such as $350 billion for state and local governments.

Other provisions of the bill include hundreds of billions for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, schools, food programs, rental assistance and ailing industries from airlines to concert halls.

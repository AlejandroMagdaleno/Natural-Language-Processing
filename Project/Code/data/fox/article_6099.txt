Fox News contributor Kayleigh McEnany sounds off on &#39;The Story&#39; on president&#39;s absence from press room
Former 
White House
 Press Secretary and Fox News contributor Kayleigh McEnany told &#34;
The Story
&#34; on Monday that she warned the press corps in the final days of the Trump administration that the suddenly rare appearances by 
Donald Trump
 would be a primer for how the Biden administration would interact with the media.
MCENANY: I actually warned some of the reporters there in the press corps. In the waning days of the Trump administration, he didn&#39;t do as much press availabilities every day as he walked to [Marine One] or those press conferences. 
I said to the correspondents, &#39;You&#39;re getting a little taste of what it will be like in the Biden administration.&#39; I said I wouldn&#39;t expect to see much of him. We haven&#39;t. We&#39;re still waiting on that solo press conference, we&#39;re still waiting for the day, apparently by the end of the month.

Customs and Border Protection nominee Chris Magnus sits for confirmation hearing before Senate Finance Committee.
Chris Magnus, 
President Biden
&#39;s nominee to be the next head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, agreed that having tens of thousands of migrants crossing the southern border during a pandemic poses a public health concern, and he expressed support for requiring 
coronavirus
 vaccinations to enter the country.
Magnus, a former paramedic, sat for his confirmation hearing before the 
Senate
 Finance Committee on Tuesday, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., asked why migrants were not being 
vaccinated
 before being released into the U.S., especially given that federal workers are required to get shots.

&#34;Actually I think any of those individuals – migrants coming into the country – should be immunized,&#34; Magnus said.
Cassidy pressed on whether those people should be required to be immunized in order to be allowed in. Magnus said &#34;that&#39;s something I definitely want to explore,&#34; and that &#34;it seems reasonable to me.&#34;

Magnus also said during the hearing that he supports continuing the use of Title 42 to expel migrants who came from countries where COVID-19 is present.
&#34;As a paramedic for 10 years, public health has always been one of my top concerns,&#34; he said.

When asked about his view on humanitarian exceptions to Title 42, Magnus admitted that he is not well versed in them and would have to become better informed before answering the question.

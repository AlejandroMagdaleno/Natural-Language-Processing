Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, on migrants with names on terror watch list crossing the border.
A group of 40 GOP senators on Wednesday asked the Government Accountability Office to decide whether 
President Biden
&#39;s decision to freeze more than $1 billion in congressionally approved 
border wall
 funding violates federal law.
The letter comes as an influx of migrants arrives at the U.S.-Mexico border, creating a humanitarian crisis.
The coalition led by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., noted Biden&#39;s immediate suspension of 
border wall
 construction on Inauguration Day.
In the weeks after Biden&#39;s inauguration, &#34;operational control of our southern border was compromised and a humanitarian and national security crisis has ensued,&#34; the senators 
wrote
.
&#34;The President&#39;s actions directly contributed to this unfortunate, yet entirely avoidable, scenario,&#34; the letter states. &#34;They are also a blatant violation of federal law and infringe on Congress&#39;s constitutional power of the purse.&#34;
BIDEN CAN&#39;T KEEP UP WITH BORDER SURGE OF MIGRANT CHILDREN, CBP OFFICIAL WARNS
The senators said they believe Biden&#39;s actions &#34;violated the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), as interpreted by your office,&#34; and are requesting the GAO&#39;s legal opinion.
Congress approved nearly $1.4 billion in border wall funding in December 2020 for fiscal year 2021 as part of former President Donald Trump&#39;s 
$900 billion coronavirus stimulus package

The senators added that border apprehensions have increased since Biden took office.

Signatories include Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the following Republican senators:
GAO managing director of public affairs Charles Young confirmed to Fox News that the office has received the letter but added that every new request goes through a review process that usually takes several weeks.
THE WORD THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WON&#39;T USE WHEN IT COMES TO THE BORDER? &#39;CRISIS&#39;
Migrant children are arriving at the U.S. 
southern border
 at rates faster than they can be processed and transferred to sponsor homes, all while the 
Biden
 administration has repeatedly denied that there is a &#34;crisis&#34; at the border, a senior Customs and Border Protection official told Fox News. 
The number of migrant children in federal custody has surged past 4,000 with roughly 94% of beds for migrant children occupied, the source told Fox News. Migrant children are entering federal custody far faster than they are leaving it, creating an unsustainable backlog, the source said.

Customs and Border Protection announced last week that 
the agency encountered
 100,441 individuals in February, a 28% increase over January, the agency said. Of those, 19,246 individuals were in family units, 9,457 were unaccompanied children (UACs) and 71,598 were single adults.
Earlier in March, a senior DHS official confirmed to Fox News that the number of migrant children in custody along the border has 
tripled
 in the past two weeks to more than 3,250 and that more than 1,360 had been held for longer than the allowed three days. 
MCCARTHY SAYS BIDEN HASN&#39;T RESPONDED TO HIS REQUEST FOR BORDER MEETING, AS GOP TIES CRISIS TO HIS POLICIES 
A number of 
Republicans
 have made 
plans to visit
 the U.S.-Mexico border and get a firsthand account of what is happening.
Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee visited the border over the weekend before Department of Homeland Security chief 
Alejandro Mayorkas
&#39; testimony before the committee on Wednesday.
Mayorkas 
released a lengthy statement on Tuesday
 defending the administration’s policies and suggesting it would not be changing course any time soon.

&#34;The situation at the southwest border is difficult,&#34; Mayorkas said. &#34;We are working around the clock to manage it and we will continue to do so. That is our job. We are making progress and we are executing on our plan. It will take time and we will not waver in our commitment to succeed.&#34;

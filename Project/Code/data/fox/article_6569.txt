John Cox, one of the leading 
Republican
 contenders in this year&#39;s 
California
 recall election, teamed up with a bear as he kicked off six-city bus tour in his push to oust embattled Democratic 
Gov. Gavin Newsom
.
A 1,000 pound California grizzly bear – which is the official state animal – joined the Republican businessman and gubernatorial candidate in the capital city of Sacramento on Tuesday – as Cox began a six-city &#34;Meet the Beast&#34; bus tour.
NEWSOM &#39;THE BEAUTY&#39; WITH GOP CONTENDER &#39;THE BEAST&#39; IN FIRST MAJOR CALIFORNIA RECALL AD BLITZ
And the bear also stars alongside Cox in a massive $5 million
 statewide ad blitz 
that launched at the same time – the first ad buy any of the recall candidates.
The bear appeared alongside Cox at the bus tour kickoff without any restraints. But Cox’s campaign explained that there was a low wire around the bear – similar to a small wire fence - that the animal’s trained to stay within.

      Republican recall candidate John Cox teams up with 1,000 pound California grizzly bear as he kicks off &#34;Meet the Beast&#34; bus tour, in Sacramento, California on May 4, 2021.
      
On the bus tour and in the commercial – which was shared first with Fox News nationally – Cox makes a &#34;beauty and the beast&#34; comparison between himself and Newsom.
NEWSOM RECALL ELECTION OFFICIALLY TRIGGERED
&#34;We need to recall our pretty boy governor,&#34; Cox said at the event.
And he spotlighted that his own background is &#34;pretty ugly,&#34; pointing out that he didn’t know his father and was raised by his mother. Cox emphasized that the bear is with him &#34;because we have to be tough as beasts&#34; to take on Newsom in the overwhelming blue state of California.
In the ad, the announcer says &#34;California’s choice: beauty or a beast&#34; and notes that the 65-year old self-made businessman, accountant, attorney and developer who’s worth over $200 million &#34;grew up with nothing – made himself a remarkable success.&#34;
Cox is then heard in the commercial, arguing that &#34;California’s falling off a cliff. High taxes. Unaffordable costs. Even Elon Musk left.&#34; 
CAITLYN JENNER SAYS &#39;ITS TIME TO REOPEN&#39; CALIFORNIA IN NEW RECALL CAMPAIGN VIDEO
The ad ends with the announcer saying, &#34;Recall the beauty. Meet the nicest, smartest, beast in California. John Cox.&#34;
The bear is seen roaring in the middle of the ad, and is with Cox at the end of the commercial.

      Republican John Cox launches the first major ad blitz of any candidate in the California recall campaign against Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, on May 4, 2021
      
The ad was produced by veteran and provocative Republican ad maker Fred Davis, who told Fox News &#34;this race is about the beauty or the beast. Newsome vs. Cox. The rest are distractions.&#34;

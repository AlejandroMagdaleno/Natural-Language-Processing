New York State Assemblyman Doug Smith on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo facing sexual harassment accusations and the nursing home scandal.
New York
 state lawmakers &#34;must act&#34; to impeach Democrat 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo
, Republican Assemblyman Doug Smith told &#34;
The Faulkner Focus
&#34; Tuesday.
&#34;A number of us have supported a recall measure in the state of New York … and it&#39;s no surprise to any of us that the governor is not entertaining calls for his resignation, but that&#39;s where we, as a separately elected, separate arm of state government, must act,&#34; Smith told host Harris Faulkner. &#34;It&#39;s time for us to pursue impeachment.&#34;
Cuomo apologized Wednesday for his past behavior following allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior by three women. The governor told reporters during a news conference that he is &#34;embarrassed&#34; by his actions and will cooperate with New York Attorney General Letitia James&#39; investigation of his conduct.
&#34;I now understand that I acted in a way that made people feel uncomfortable. It was unintentional and I truly and deeply apologize for it,&#34; Cuomo said. &#34;I feel awful about it and frankly I am embarrassed by it.&#34;
CUOMO APOLOGIZES BUT WON’T RESIGN AS HE DENIES TOUCHING ANYONE &#39;INAPPROPRIATELY&#39;: &#39;I AM EMBARRASSED’
Cuomo went on to say that he &#34;never knew at the time I was making anyone feel uncomfortable,&#34; that he has &#34;learned an important lesson,&#34; and &#34;will be the better for this experience.&#34;
&#34;I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll be getting an Emmy for that performance,&#34; Smith remarked Thursday. &#34;And I think New Yorkers like [Fox News senior meteorologist] Janice Dean are still waiting for their apology [for the nursing home scandal].&#34;
The lawmaker added that members of both parties are &#34;are furious&#34; at Cuomo.
&#34;I speak with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and [they&#39;re] saying that right now, it is impossible for us to do the people&#39;s work and do the business that we were elected [to do] for 19.5 million New Yorkers,&#34; Smith said. &#34;When we talk about those nursing home fatalities, Madison Square Garden can hold how many New Yorkers lost their lives in nursing homes. And that&#39;s in part due to state government&#39;s incompetence with that March 25th order.&#34;

Smith concluded by noting that &#34;the threshold [for impeachment] in New York is willful and corrupt conduct ... not high crimes and misdemeanors ...
&#34;[Democrat Assmblyman and Cuomo critic] Ron Kim ... is actually the chair of a committee [Committee on Aging]. He has the power to subpoena witnesses, compel testimony and investigate what has happened with this nursing home situation. And the governor intimidated him, or attempted to,&#34; Smith claimed. &#34;So for me, that&#39;s a crime and that&#39;s what I would support impeachment for. I do encourage these women to continue to share their stories, and for more to come forward, please. We want to hear what you have to say.&#34;

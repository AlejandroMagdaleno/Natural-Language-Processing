Fox News senior strategic analyst provides insight on U.S.-Iran relations on ‘America’s Newsroom.’
Biden
 administration officials, including John Kerry and Robert Malley, had meetings with 
Iranian
 Foreign Minister Javad Zarif during the Trump administration that were orchestrated to undermine President Biden&#39;s predecessor, a recent report from The Washington Times claims.
Zarif held meetings with Obama administration veterans who could return to power &#34;to devise a political strategy to undermine the Trump administration&#34; and usher in softer diplomacy between the U.S. and Iran, according to an unnamed former senior U.S. official cited by 
The Washington Times
.

Kerry is now Biden&#39;s climate envoy, and Malley, who was part of creating the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) regarding Iran&#39;s nuclear capabilities, is Biden&#39;s Iran envoy.

The Washington Times reported that while former President Donald Trump&#39;s attempts to set up a back channel with Iranian officials, meant to defuse tensions, fizzled, Democrats like Malley were meeting with Zarif.
Kerry has been open about the fact that he met with Zarif at least twice during the Trump administration, prompting Trump to say he should be 
prosecuted
 under the Logan Act because of the meetings.

FOX News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on the left&#39;s attempt to push the curriculum in schools
Civil rights veteran Bob Woodson condemned the Roosevelt Institute, an organization dedicated to furthering former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#39;s vision, for celebrating 1619 Project founder Nikole Hannah-Jones for free speech. 
The institute honored Hannah-Jones
 for &#34;freedom of speech and expression&#34; and Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., for &#34;freedom of worship&#34; in an awards ceremony Wednesday night.
&#34;It’s kind of like an arsonist being honored at the firefighter’s convention,&#34; Woodson, founder and president of The Woodson Center, told Fox News. 
FACEBOOK SLAMMED FOR PROMOTING 1619 PROJECT CONTENT: ‘UTTERLY IRRESPONSIBLE’
Woodson noted that when vandals last year spray-painted &#34;1619&#34; on a toppled statue of George Washington, Claremont McKenna College professor Charles Kesler wrote of the destructive riots in the summer of 2020, &#34;
Call them the 1619 riots
.&#34; Hannah-Jones responded with a tweet saying she would be &#34;honored&#34; by the moniker. She later deleted the tweet.
&#34;That seems like a strange thing for someone who&#39;s being honored for free speech to have this happen,&#34; Woodson noted. He also cited many examples of 1619 Project supporters who shut down free speech. He noted that a Loudoun County, Virginia, advisory board 
recommended
 that teachers who oppose equity training be fired.

&#34;People who advocate critical race theory and 1619 have been at the forefront of cancel culture,&#34; Woodson told Fox News. &#34;It’s ironic that Nicole Hannah-Jones would be honored for freedom of speech.&#34;
Historians have faulted
 the 1619 Project for twisting history, in particular for claiming that the American Revolution aimed to protect slavery, a claim The New York Times later retracted. The Times later stealth-edited the website to remove the claim that 1619 represented the &#34;true founding&#34; of America. Citing numerous such errors, 
scholars have demanded
 that the Pulitzer Prize board retract the award it gave to Hannah-Jones.
Yet Woodson warned that the 1619 Project – and critical race theory, the view that a latent racism pervades American society despite civil rights laws forbidding discrimination – is &#34;most detrimental to the Black community.&#34;
He accused Hannah-Jones of &#34;fostering anti-American sentiment,&#34; claiming that &#34;she has given aid and comfort to those who speak out against the founding principles of the country.&#34;
&#34;As a veteran of the civil rights movement myself, what I find most disheartening is their support of the dumbing down of standards,&#34; he said. He noted that many jurisdictions – most 
recently New York City
 – have moved away from &#34;gifted and talented&#34; programs in the name of equality.
NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES CLAIMS OPPOSITION TO 1619 PROJECT NOT ABOUT ‘ACCURATE RENDERING OF HISTORY’
&#34;It is very very insulting to Black America,&#34; Woodson said. He said he preferred &#34;the old-fashioned bigotry&#34; of outspoken racism over the &#34;new progressive bigotry.&#34; 
&#34;The new progressive bigotry masquerades as fighting for social justice for Blacks. It masquerades as something promoting the interests of Blacks while at the same time denigrating them,&#34; he claimed. Citing the Woodson Center&#39;s book &#34;Red, White, and Black: Rescuing American History from Revisionists and Race Hustlers,&#34; Woodson noted that at the beginning of the 1900s, five high-performing Black high schools in five major cities outperformed White schools despite systemic barriers like less funding.

      Bob Woodson is the founder and president of The Woodson Center.
      
&#34;Nikole Hannah-Jones, Warnock, and the rest of them ignore that history of excellence and achievement against the odds and instead demand that the standards be lowered because Blacks can&#39;t compete,&#34; he charged.
Woodson also faulted Warnock for choosing &#34;to associate himself with this race grievance mantra.&#34;
Despite the criticism the 1619 Project has received from Woodson, historians and others, The Roosevelt Institute stood by its decision to honor Hannah-Jones.

&#34;Our decision to honor Ms. Hannah-Jones speaks for itself,&#34; RI spokesperson Ariela Weinberger told Fox News in a brief email statement.
Warnock did not respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment on the event or on the criticism of the 1619 Project. The New York Times also declined to respond to the criticism, and Hannah-Jones could not be reached for comment.

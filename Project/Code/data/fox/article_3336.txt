Gov. Ron DeSantis takes aim at President Biden over vaccine mandates and Afghanistan withdrawal while speaking at a political event in Nebraska City, Nebraska
Gov. 
Ron DeSantis
, R-Fla., questioned Tuesday if the United States should rethink its diplomatic relationship with 
Australia
 given its strict, 
military-enforced
 COVID-19 lockdowns.
Speaking at the International Boat Builders’ Exhibition and Conference in Tampa, DeSantis touched on his own state&#39;s response to the virus, saying, &#34;I really believe that if we had not done what we did during the last year and a half to keep the state open, to protect people’s jobs, to protect our small businesses, to protect our kids being able to go to school — if we had not done that, a lot of these other states wouldn’t have followed.
&#34;And who knows where we would be right now?&#34; he asked.
&#34;You say, like, ‘It can’t happen here,&#39;&#34; DeSantis continued. &#34;You know, you guys, look what’s going on in Australia right now. You know, they’re enforcing, after a year and a half, they’re still enforcing lockdowns by the military.&#34;
&#34;That’s not a free country. It’s not a free country at all. In fact, I mean, I wonder why we would still have the same diplomatic relations when they’re doing that. Is Australia freer than China, communist China, right now? I don’t know. The fact that that’s even a question tells you something has gone dramatically off the rails with some of this stuff.&#34;

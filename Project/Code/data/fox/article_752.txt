Fox News White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich reports on allegations Biden withdrew from Afghanistan against military advice.
Then-candidate Joe Biden
 reluctantly approved a campaign ad bashing his then-primary rival 
Pete Buttigieg’s
 record as South Bend mayor only to demand it be taken down a few hours later, according to an upcoming book.
The new book &#34;Peril&#34; by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa details how Biden’s campaign, struggling in early 2020 in the Democratic presidential primary,  pulled together a new attack ad called 
&#34;Pete’s Record&#34;
 which contrasted Biden’s experience as vice president with Buttigieg’s experience as mayor as a small town.

With the campaign struggling for money, Woodward reports that adviser Mike Donilon argued that it was necessary to release it to the media and YouTube so it would be picked up.
&#34;I hate it,&#34; Biden reportedly said, but OK’d its release.
The attack ad would face criticism that it showed desperation from Biden and was a snarky, dirty hit. But &#34;Peril&#34; details how Biden allegedly changed his mind on allowing its release just six hours later.
&#34;Take it off,&#34; he reportedly told Donilon. &#34;Take it back. I don&#39;t want it airing any longer. Take it down!&#34;
But it was too late, and it had already been picked up by the media.

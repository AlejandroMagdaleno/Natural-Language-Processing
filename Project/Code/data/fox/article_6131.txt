Judge Merrick Garland, 
President Biden&#39;s
 attorney general nominee, was grilled by  Republican 
senators
 during Monday&#39;s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the hearing continued Tuesday as outside witnesses testify.
Meanwhile, Biden is standing behind a pair of Cabinet picks facing uphill battles — including 
Neera Tanden
, his nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget, and 
Xavier Becerra,
 his pick for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services — as a growing number of senators have vowed to oppose their confirmations.
On Monday, Garland dodged questions about the Durham investigation into the Trump-Russia probe origins, transgender athletes in high school sports, and whether crossing the border illegally should be a criminal offense. 
Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, asked Garland whether he believes that illegally crossing the border should remain a crime.
Garland was also asked about allowing biologically male athletes who identify as transgender to compete in female athletic competitions. 
&#34;I haven&#39;t thought about that question, I just haven&#39;t thought about that question,&#34; Garland said. &#34;The president has made clear that we are a nation with borders, with national security, I don&#39;t know of a proposal to decriminalize but still make it unlawful to answer, I just haven&#39;t thought about it.&#34; 
Garland also defended Kristen Clarke, the attorney 
tapped to lead
 the Justice Department’s civil rights division, during a heated exchange with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, at the hearing.

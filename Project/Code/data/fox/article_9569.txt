Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Victor Davis Hanson weighs in on cancel culture in the United States.
Conservatives have to keep speaking out against 
cancel culture
, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Victor Davis Hanson said on Wednesday.
&#34;I think we all know we’re in it, but, people are afraid to say we’re in it. You, me, everybody we know is one word, one look, one wink away from being destroyed,&#34; Hanson told &#34;
America&#39;s Newsroom
.&#34; 
Hanson is facing issues at Stanford University over his past statements about the 2020 presidential election. He said that people are arguing his criticisms &#34;are equivalent to killing people in the Capitol.&#34; 
&#34;But if you don&#39;t fight back against that, then they&#39;re going to be in power,&#34; Hanson said.
FIRED &#39;MANDALORIAN&#39; STAR GINA CARANO&#39;S FANS PETITION FOR DISNEY TO BRING HER BACK TO THE &#39;STAR WARS&#39; FRANCHISE
Hanson&#39;s comments came after the actress and former MMA fighter Gina Carano was 
fired from her role
 on the hit &#34;Star Wars&#34; show &#34;The Mandalorian&#34; over comments she made on social media. The move marked the latest in a slew of calls for Disney, whose 
streaming service
 Disney+ plays home &#34;The Mandalorian,&#34; to 
fire Carano
 after she drew criticism for multiple posts on social media, including one in which she compared today&#39;s political divide to the events in Nazi 
Germany
.
A new 
Change.org petition
 started by fans calling for Lucasfilm and Disney to give Carano her part on the show back and to keep politics out of their artistic decisions going forward.

Hanson said the 
cancel culture
 &#34;won’t stop&#34; unless those who are subject to the cancel culture &#34;fight back.&#34;
&#34;Every time a person apologizes or gives a reeducation type of confessional, then they get empowered and they say, &#39;see, we did this.&#39; And it&#39;s not really ideological entirely either, Dana. I think a lot of it&#39;s personal. A lot of people come out of the woodwork in these times of Salem witch trials or reign of terror, French Revolution,&#34; Hanson said.
&#34;They want that person&#39;s job. Their ego gets enhanced. And under the cover of being woke, they do a lot of very dangerous things. But it won&#39;t stop until we fight back and are explicit that we&#39;re not afraid of it. We&#39;re not going to apologize for who we are, what we believe.&#34;

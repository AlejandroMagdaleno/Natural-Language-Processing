Fox News&#39; Jennifer Griffin reports relaxed lab security was flagged on &#39;Special Report&#39;
A top scientist emailed Dr. 
Anthony Fauci
 during the early days of the 
COVID-19
 outbreak that the virus seemed like it may have been engineered. 
The following evening, the scientist joined other experts on a call with the top disease doctor and days later dismissed the idea of an engineered virus as a &#34;crackpot&#34; theory.
NYT WRITER HITS FAUCI IN SCATHING OP-ED
Two top House Republicans now want to know how a scientist can have such a dramatic change in opinion -- so quickly -- about a virus that continues to baffle top experts.
Rep. Jim Jordan
, R-Ohio, 
said in a letter Thursday
 to Kristian Andersen, a virologist at California’s Scripps Research Institute, that he&#39;s interested in learning what was discussed during the call that may have contributed to the change of opinion.
Andersen&#39;s email was released along with a trove of others back in June. 
The email read, in part
, &#34;The unusual features of the virus make up a really small part of the genome (&lt;0.1%) so one has to look really closely at all the sequences to see that some of the features (potentially) look engineered,&#34; he wrote. He admitted in the email that the research was in its early stages and his team needed more time to get a better grasp.
Jordan, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., ranking member on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, pointed out in a letter to Andersen that the email was sent Jan. 31, 2020. The following evening, Andersen and &#34;several other international virologists&#34; were on a call with Fauci.

The Republicans said the contents of the call remain a mystery, but between the conversation and Feb. 4, 2020, Andersen sent Dr. Peter Daszak, CEO of EcoHealth Alliance, an email that called the man-made idea one of &#34;the main crackpot theories going around at the moment.&#34;
&#34;This is demonstrably not the case,&#34; Andersen wrote to Daszak, according to the statement.
Andersen, Fauci&#39;s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Daszak did not respond to after-hours emails from Fox News seeking comment. 
&#34;In three days, with no explanation as to why, you flipped your perspective entirely and began calling a theory you lent credence to only days earlier a ‘crackpot theory,’&#34; the representatives wrote. &#34;It would appear the primary intervening event was the February 1 conference call with Dr. Fauci. We are very interested in understanding what happened on that call or what science came to light that caused such a dramatic change in your own hypothesis as to the engineering of COVID-19. Therefore, we request a staff level briefing as soon as possible but no later than August 5, 2021.&#34;
Andersen has been defended on social media by those who say it is common for scientists to have evolving theories about diseases.

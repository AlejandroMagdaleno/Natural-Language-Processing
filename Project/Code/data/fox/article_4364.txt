Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is calling for the creation of a 1.5 million-strong group of civilians to work on federally funded projects addressing climate change; ‘Green Fraud’ author Marc Morano reacts. 
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., tried to &#34;aggressively confront&#34; 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 
on Wednesday, shouting questions about why the New York Democrat supports &#34;terrorists and antifa,&#34; according to a report.
Two reporters from the 
Washington Post
 said they witnessed the interaction outside the House chamber. The report said Greene yelled to Ocasio-Cortez, and the Democrat continued walking. Greene reportedly tried to catch up and continued to ask questions. Greene also brought up her desire to debate Ocasio-Cortez, the paper said. At one point, Greene reportedly shouted, &#34;You don’t care about the American people.&#34;
AOC HITS BIDEN OVER STATEMENT ON ISREAL&#39;S RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF
Neither office responded to an after-hours email from Fox News seeking comment.
The Post reported that Ocasio-Cortez never stopped to talk, but at one point turned around to throw &#34;her hands in the air in an exasperated motion.&#34;

A spokeswoman from Ocasio-Cortez’s office told the paper that the office hopes &#34;leadership and the Sergeant at Arms will take real steps to make Congress a safe, civil place for all Members and staff.&#34;
The statement mentioned an unnamed representative who moved her office. (Earlier this year, Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., moved her office to be farther from Greene.)
Greene had been calling on Ocasio-Cortez to 
debate her for some time.
 Last month, she tweeted a photo of the two speaking on the House floor. She tweeted, &#34;I’m glad I ran into you today @AOC to plan our debate about the Green New Deal. &#34;After I finish reading all 14 pages, like we agreed, I’ll schedule time for our debate.&#34;

The Post said that Greene addressed a small group of reporters shortly after and called Ocasio-Cortez a &#34;chicken&#34; who has no intention to debate the Green New Deal.
&#34;These members are cowards. They need to defend their legislation to the people. That’s pathetic,&#34; she said, according to the paper.

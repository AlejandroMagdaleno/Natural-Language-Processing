Secretary of Defense
 Lloyd Austin sought to assure 
China
 Thursday that the latest 
tri-lateral agreement
 between the U.S., U.K
,
 and Australia is &#34;not aimed at anyone.&#34;
&#34;On the issue of China, let me just emphasize upfront – this agreement, this relationship is not aimed anything or anyone,&#34; Austin told reporters during a joint press conference with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Australian foreign and defense ministers. &#34;Its intent here is to help improve our bilateral cooperation and our capabilities across the board.  
&#34;And the first step is helping Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarine capability,&#34; he added. 
FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER CALLS US-AUSTRALIA SUBMARINE DEAL A &#39;STAB IN THE BACK&#39;
Austin’s comments come just one day after 
Australia
, the 
United Kingdom
, and the 
U.S.
 entered into an agreement dubbed AUKUS that voided a 2016 submarine agreement between 
France
 and the Aussie nation. 
The AUKUS alliance will instead grant the Indo-Pacific nation with highly sensitive nuclear submarine technology – a move widely seen as a direct challenge to China’s activity in the region.
Austin’s assurances however that the move was not in response to increased Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific region, did not jive with the other comments made by the officials on stage with him. 
&#34;We have raised publically and privately our serious concerns about Beijing’s use of economic cohesion against Australia,&#34; Blinken said. &#34;We’ve made it clear that actions like these targeting our allies hinder improvements in our own relationship with the Chinese government.&#34;

Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne also said that China was a major factor in the new alliance and said the officials &#34;discussed the strategic competition&#34; as it relates to the communist nation.
&#34;We discussed the competition of China on a number of levels that requires us to respond and to increase resilience,&#34; Payne said. Though she added that acknowledging competition with China &#34;does not mean that there are not constructive areas for engagement with China.&#34;
Australian Defence Minister Peter Dutton said Australia’s alliance with the U.S. is its &#34;most important&#34; relationship &#34;bar none.&#34;
&#34;It stands as a pillar of security and stability in the Indo-Pacific,&#34; Dutton added.  
In addition to supplying submarine technology, the U.S. will increase &#34;air-cooperation&#34; through &#34;rotational deployments&#34; of U.S. military aircraft to Australia, the defense minister said.

Dutton also said the situation in the Indo-Pacific region has led to &#34;significant uncertainty&#34; not seen in &#34;any time since the Second World War.&#34;
Dutton added later: &#34;We’ve enjoyed peace since the Second World War and we want that to continue.&#34;

Political strategist
 and social activist Symone Sanders has been named chief spokesperson and senior adviser to 
Vice President Kamala Harris
. 
Sanders, a native of 
Omaha, Neb.
, attended and matriculated from Mercy High School and Creighton University.
Sanders 
worked for Girls Inc. of Omaha
 as their community campaign chair in 2013, according to her LinkedIn and the organization.
According to Politico, she became 
a columnist for the Omaha Star
 -- Nebraska’s only Black-owned 
newspaper
, where her mother was 
recently appointed publisher
 -- before joining the gubernatorial campaign for 
Democrat
 Chuck Hassebrook as their communications assistant at age 23. Less than five months later, Sanders was the campaign&#39;s deputy communications director.
BIDEN-HARRIS AGENDA SET TO CONFRONT THESE CHALLENGES
In 2014, Sanders moved to 
Washington, D.C.
, where she worked as 
communications director
 for 
Virginia
 Delegate Michael Futrell. 
At that time, Sanders also did communications work for nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen&#39;s Global Trade Watch.
Global Trade Watch is a program 
that aims to ensure
 that a majority are able to &#34;enjoy 
economic
 security, a clean 
environment
, safe 
food
, 
medicines
 and products, access to quality affordable services such as 
health care
 and the exercise of democratic decision-making about the matters that affect their lives.&#34;
Less than a year later, progressive 
Sen. Bernie Sanders
, I-Vt., would hire her as the national press secretary for his 
2016 presidential campaign
. 
At the age of just 25, Sanders became the 
youngest presidential press secretary
 on record, according to her biography.
As the former chair of the Coalition for Juvenile Justice Emerging Leaders Committee and member of the Federal Advisory Committee on Juvenile Justice, Sanders advocated for social and racial justice and highlighted economic equality 
&#34;I [told Bernie], you know, economic equality is an issue. It’s something we need to address,&#34; she 
told Buzzfeed in 2018
. &#34;But for some people it doesn’t matter how much money you make, it doesn’t matter where you went to school, it doesn’t matter what your parents do. It doesn’t matter that 
Sandra Bland
 had a job and was on her way to teach for her alma mater. It doesn’t matter. None of that matters.&#34;
In June 2016, 
Sanders told Politico
 she was leaving the campaign. 
&#34;I believe my time at the campaign has come to an end,&#34; she said at the time. &#34;I&#39;m very proud of the work we have done and am now looking forward to helping elect down-ballot Democrats and do all I can to ensure a Democrat is the 45th president of the United States.&#34;
Less than a month later, 
Buzzfeed reported
 that Sanders would join the 
Democratic National Convention Committee
.
At the convention, Sanders made some media appearances before she was hired by CNN as a Democratic strategist and political commentator that fall.  
In 2017, 
Politico reported
 that Sanders had agreed to join Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action ahead of the 2018 elections, and in 2018 and 2019 she was a resident fellow at 
Harvard&#39;s Institute of Politics at the Kennedy School
 and the 
University of Southern California&#39;s Center for the Political Future
, respectively.

Sanders is also the 
principal of the 360 Group, LLC
, where she provides strategic communications guidance and helps clients find sound solutions to &#34;tough political and social problems,&#34; according to her bio.
During the 2020 election, Sanders 
served as a senior adviser
 to then-candidate 
Joe Biden
.
Now 31
, Sanders will serve in the White House -- 
a goal she had discussed
 in her memoir &#34;No, You Shut Up: Speaking Truth to Power and Reclaiming America.&#34;
&#34;One day I want to be 
White House
 press secretary,&#34; she wrote. &#34;There, I said it.&#34;
For the first time, all of the White House&#39;s top communications posts are held by women, according to reporting from 
The Washington Post
.
Sanders acknowledged the &#34;ALL LADY SQUAD&#34; in a series of November tweets. 
&#34;Ready to serve accurately describes how I feel,&#34; she wrote. &#34;Thank you Madam Vice President-elect @KamalaHarris for entrusting me with this charge. It has been the honor of my life to work for @JoeBiden &amp; I am elated to have the opportunity to continue to that work in the PEOPLE&#39;S HOUSE.&#34;

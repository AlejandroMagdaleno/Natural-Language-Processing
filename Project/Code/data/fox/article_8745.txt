6th grade teacher who resigned over mask mandates speaks out on ‘Fox &amp; Friends.’
Tennessee 
Gov. Bill Lee signed an executive order Monday allowing parents to opt their children out of 
coronavirus
 mask mandates in public 
schools
.
&#34;No one cares more about the health &amp; well-being of a child than a parent,&#34; the Republican governor tweeted in announcing the order. &#34;Districts will make the decisions they believe are best for their schools, but parents are THE authority &amp; will be the ultimate decision-makers for their individual child’s health &amp; well-being. I will not be calling a special session at this time.&#34;
COLORADO DEPUTIES WILL BE AT SCHOOLS DUE TO &#39;TENSIONS&#39; OVER MASK MANDATE
The order
 states that a parent or guardian has the right, via a written notice, to opt out of any requirement for a student in kindergarten through 12th grade to wear a face covering at school, on a school bus or at school functions. 
In a statement, Lee said that while &#34;local decision-making is important, individual decision-making by a parent on issues regarding the health and well-being of their child is the most important.&#34;
The governor also pushed the importance of more Tennesseans to get vaccinated but assured them it would not be mandated.
Tennessee state House Speaker Cameron Sexton, a Republican, had previously asked Lee to call a special session in an attempt to block school districts from mandating masks.
Sexton cheered the governor’s order in a series of 
tweets
 Monday evening.
&#34;Gov. Lee’s executive order issued today is good news in affirming a parent’s right to make healthcare decisions for their children,&#34; he wrote. &#34;I feel confident the immediate need for a special session has been averted in the interim by using executive orders. However, the House still stands ready to act if the call comes.&#34;

State Rep. Antonio Parkinson, a Democrat, slammed the decision as &#34;irresponsible.&#34;
&#34;Aren&#39;t emergency orders supposed to be used to help mitigate or control but not exasperate an emergency situation? Is this an abuse of power?&#34; he 
tweeted
 Tuesday morning.
Shelby County Schools
, the state&#39;s largest school district, and 
Metro Nashville Public Schools
 have announced in light of Lee’s order that they are keeping their mask mandates in place.

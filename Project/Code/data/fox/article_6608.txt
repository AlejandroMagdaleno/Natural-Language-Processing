California gubernatorial candidate addresses the failures of Gov. Newsom ahead of Tuesday&#39;s recall election.
Gov. Gavin Newsom&#39;s team seems to be striking a confident tone just a day before Tuesday&#39;s 
California 
recall election, and said that there&#39;s no &#34;
scenario where we lose
.&#34;
&#34;I don’t see a scenario where we’re not talking about a victory for the governor and a complete rejection of this appalling partisan power grab,&#34; said Newsom strategist Sean Clegg. &#34;I think what we’re seeing in our projections in the early vote is we’re performing so well we might reach a point where there’s not enough Republican vote left on the table for them to overtake us. We’ll let you know when we reach that.&#34;

the coronavirus

Republicans see the recall election as their best chance to topple a politician who has never lost an election during his years as San Francisco mayor, California lieutenant governor, and now governor – and their first chance to win a statewide contest since the 2006 gubernatorial reelection victory by then-Gov.

On Monday night, President Biden 
urged Californians to keep Newsom as their governor
 during a rally in Long Beach.
&#34;The eyes of the nation are on California because the decision you’re going to make isn’t just going to have a huge impact on California, it’s going to reverberate around the nation, and quite frankly — not a joke — around the world,&#34; Biden said. 
The president also contended that a &#34;Trump clone&#34; could replace Newsom, which was an apparent reference to conservative talk radio host 
Larry Elder
, the Republican frontrunner.

&#34;All of you know that last year I got to run against the real Donald Trump,&#34; Biden said. &#34;Well, this year the leading Republican running for governor is a closest thing to a Trump clone that I&#39;ve ever seen in your state.&#34;

&#34;You either keep Gavin Newsom as your governor or you’ll get Donald Trump,&#34; he added. &#34;It’s not a joke. A Republican governor blocking progress on COVID-19 who is also anti-woman, anti-worker, a climate denier, who doesn’t believe in choice. The choice should be absolutely clear.&#34;
The recall push was launched in June 2020 due to frustrations by many Californians over the governor’s restrictive response to the coronavirus. On Monday, Biden defended Newsom&#39;s handling of the virus, arguing that voting no would protect California from &#34;Trump Republicans trying to block us from beating this pandemic.&#34;
&#34;We don&#39;t need politics in this battle against Covid,&#34; he added. &#34;We need science. We need courage. We need leadership. We need Gavin Newsom.&#34;

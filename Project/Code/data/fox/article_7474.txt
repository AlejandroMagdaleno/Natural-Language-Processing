Fox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy has a heated exchange with Press Secretary Jen Psaki
White House
 press secretary Jen Psaki said the 
Biden
 
administration will &#34;welcome&#34; a COVID-19 vaccine public service announcement (PSA) from former 
President 
Trump
 
as 
coronavirus
 
cases around the country rise.
Fox News’ Peter Doocy questioned Psaki during the administration’s daily press briefing, asking about &#34;vaccine hesitancy&#34; and if President Biden would reach out to Trump to &#34;cut a PSA&#34; telling people to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
America is facing a rising COVID-19 case count, with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Rochelle Walensky recently saying the U.S. is facing &#34;a pandemic of the unvaccinated&#34; as hospitalizations and deaths rise among unvaccinated Americans.
CRITICS SLAM BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S REPORTED PLAN TO MONITOR VACCINE MISINFORMATION IN TEXT MESSAGES
Psaki said government data shows that &#34;the most-trusted voices are local officials, doctors, medical experts, civic leaders,&#34; as well as &#34;clergy, from time to time,&#34; and that those are the areas where the administration has &#34;really invested&#34; their funding and resources.
The president’s press secretary 
noted
 
that &#34;almost every former president&#34; has put out a PSA telling people that the COVID-19 vaccine &#34;is safe and effective.&#34;
She also said the administration doesn’t believe an &#34;embroidered invitation&#34; is required for Trump to make a vaccine PSA and noted that him doing so would be a welcome &#34;engagement.&#34;

&#34;But, certainly, any role of anyone who has a platform where they can provide information to the public that the vaccine is safe, it is effective, we don’t see this as a political issue,&#34; Psaki said. &#34;We’d certainly welcome that engagement.&#34;
The administration came under fire recently when a 
Politico
 
report revealed the Biden administration has plans to work with tech companies and SMS carriers to monitor and combat misinformation, a plan that immediately garnered scrutiny from conservatives.
Additionally, the White House came under fire after announcing their &#34;
door-to-door
&#34; vaccine effort after failing to hit the administration’s 70% vaccination rate goal for the population by July 4.

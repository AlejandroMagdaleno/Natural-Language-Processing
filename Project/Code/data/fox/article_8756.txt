Social media users roasted 
Virginia
 gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe on Tuesday after he posted a video showcasing his dance moves during a campaign event ahead of his state’s 
Democratic primary election
.
McAuliffe danced on stage alongside Virginia state Sens. Louise Lucas and Lionell Spruill during a rally in Norfolk. Some social media users were less than impressed with his skills. The former governor seemingly poked fun at the reaction, writing that he &#34;heard folks wanted more dancing videos!&#34;
&#34;Is this what they mean by white boy summer,&#34; comedian Bridget Phetasy wrote, in a reference to the viral catchphrase coined by Tom Hanks’ son, actor and musician Chet Hanks.
&#34;I have questions. So many questions. Don&#39;t think I want the answers though,&#34; one Twitter user wrote in response to the video.
&#34;You’ve got my vote but I’ll need my eyes to see the ballot. Please stop whatever this is!&#34; another user wrote.
Other users compared McAuliffe’s performance to that of former Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, who famously danced at a campaign event in February 2020 during his ill-fated run for the party’s nomination.

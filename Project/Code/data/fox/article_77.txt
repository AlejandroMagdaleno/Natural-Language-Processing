Both the left and right want to politicize the courts.
A 
Texas
 
abortion
 provider testifying during a House Oversight Committee hearing on abortion restrictions referred to abortion as a &#34;blessing&#34; that represents and act of &#34;love&#34; and &#34;freedom.&#34;
&#34;SB 8 has not only caused a near total abortion ban in Texas, it has made it extremely dangerous to be pregnant in Texas,&#34; Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi 
testified
,
 referring to a newly enacted Texas bill banning abortions after a fetal heartbeat can be detected. She claimed that the law has disproportionally hurt minorities. &#34;I know firsthand that abortion saves lives, for the thousands of people I’ve cared for abortion is a blessing, abortion is an act of love, abortion is freedom,&#34; she said.
PELOSI&#39;S BISHOP CALLS FOR MASSIVE &#39;CAMPAIGN OF PRAYER AND FASTING&#39; FOR &#39;HER CONVERSION OF HEART&#39; ON ABORTION
 
&#34;We need federal protection now,&#34; Moayedi, a board-certified ob-gyn, added. &#34;We need laws that elevate science and evidence and recognize the dignity and autonomy of people accessing care.&#34;
Moayedi’s comments drew immediate criticism from conservatives and pro-life advocates on Twitter. 
&#34;I’m sorry, I must have misheard,&#34; Rep. Michelle Fischbach, R-Minn., tweeted. &#34;You meant to say, ‘Life is a blessing, life is a gift, abortion is one of the biggest tragedies in our nation’, right?&#34;

Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also responded to the clip, stating that both sides of the argument should agree that abortion is a &#34;horrible thing.&#34;
&#34;Science tells us that an unborn baby is a human being,&#34; Walker tweeted. &#34;Abortion ends that life. It is not a blessing, an act of love, or freedom for the human being that is killed through an abortion. One thing we should all agree on is that abortion is a horrible thing.&#34;
&#34;I’m black and I been black my whole life,&#34; Republican congressional candidate Lavern Spicer tweeted. &#34;I’ve never been so offended.&#34;

Republican Rep. Andy Biggs referred to Moayedi’s remarks as &#34;demented.&#34;
Moayedi appeared to stand by her comments on Twitter following the hearing by retweeting a post about abortion being a blessing and tweeting &#34;I said it and I meant it&#34; in response to another remark she made.
Moayedi has 
penned
 several editorials in favor of advancing abortion access, with headlines like &#34;All I Want for Christmas Is for Texans to Be Able to Afford Their Abortions&#34; and &#34;How Motherhood Made Me a Better Abortion Provider.

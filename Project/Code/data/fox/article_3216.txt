Democratic
 representatives, including Carolyn Maloney, N.Y., and Ayanna Pressley, Mass., are pressuring the government to remove restrictions that require the dispensing of 
abortion
 drugs in-person at certain medical facilities.
Maloney and Pressley wrote an op-ed in Elle this week explaining a 
letter
 they sent urging the Food and Drug Administration to lift the requirement on mifepristone, which is a prescription drug that has been used to terminate early pregnancies.
The Democratic congresswomen of the House Oversight Committee argue that people seeking the drug during the pandemic have been forced to put themselves in &#34;harm’s way&#34; in order to obtain it, even though the FDA has relaxed dispensing requirements for several other drugs.

Therefore, the Democratic lawmakers say the requirement is nothing more than &#34;a thinly veiled attempt to stigmatize safe, simple abortion care.&#34;

But the Trump administration followed up with the Supreme Court, which issued a stay on the injunction of the in-person dispensing rule last month.
In addition to Maloney and Pressley, a number of other lawmakers signed on to the letter sent to the FDA, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Cori Bush, D-Mo., and Jackie Speier, D-Calif..

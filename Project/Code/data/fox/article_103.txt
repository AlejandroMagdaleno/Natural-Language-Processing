House Minority Whip Steve Scalise discusses Rep. Rashida Tlaib&#39;s push to defund ICE, CBP and DHS.
The president of the Anti-Defamation League is slamming Rep. 
Rashida Tlaib
, D-Mich., for what he suggested were anti-Semitic remarks the lawmaker made at the 2021 Democratic Socialist of America (DSA) National Convention.  
&#34;We also need to recognize- and this is for me as a Palestinian American, we also need to recognize as I think about my family and Palestine that continue to live under military occupation and how that really interacts with this beautiful Black city that I grew up in,&#34; Tlaib began, referring to her hometown of Detroit. &#34;You know, I always tell people cutting people off from water is violence from Gaza to Detroit. And it&#39;s a way to control people, to oppress people. And it&#39;s those structures that we continue to fight against.&#34;
JEWISH GROUPS CONDEMN RASHIDA TLAIB OVER TIES TO RADICAL PRO-HEZBOLLAH, ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIVIST
&#34;I know that you all understand the structure that we&#39;ve been living under right now is designed by those that exploit the rest of us for their own profit,&#34; Tlaib continued. &#34;I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s the issue around global human rights and our fight to free Palestine or to pushing back against those that don&#39;t believe in the minimum wage or those that believe that people have a right to health care and so much more. And I tell people those same people that if you open the curtain and look behind the curtain, it&#39;s the same people that make money and, yes they do, off of racism, off of these broken policies. There is someone there making money and you saw it!&#34;
Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADL&#39;s president, took to Twitter on Tuesday and scolded the Democratic &#34;Squad&#34; member for her remarks.

&#34;Stunning to hear @RashidaTlaib claim ‘behind the curtain,’ those who prevent a ‘free Palestine’ are the ‘same people’ who exploit ‘regular Americans.’ We&#39;ve heard this kind of ugly #antisemitic dog whistling before, but it&#39;s appalling when it comes from a member of Congress,&#34; Greenblatt tweeted. 
Tlaib&#39;s office did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.

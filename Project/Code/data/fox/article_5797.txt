Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen discusses new report claiming Sen. Joe Manchin could leave Democratic Party.
Sen. 
Joe Manchin
, D-W.Va., told reporters on Wednesday that a report about him potentially leaving the 
Democratic Party
 is &#34;bulls---.&#34;
Manchin was swarmed by reporters ahead of the vote for President Biden’s controversial Education Department nominee Catherine Lhamon, asking him about a report that said the senator was considering leaving his party and becoming an independent.
The West Virginia Democrat told the gaggle of reporters that he has &#34;no control over the rumors&#34; before calling the Wednesday report &#34;bulls---.&#34;
MANCHIN STANDS FIRM, DECLARES HE CANNOT SUPPORT TRILLIONS MORE IN SPENDING
The report by 
Mother 
Jones
 
alleged that Manchin was eyeing the exit ramp from his leftward-lurching party over the size of the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion spending package, which he wants to see drop to $1.75 trillion.
According to the report, Manchin was considering becoming an &#34;American Independent&#34; should the price tag not drop – a point of contention between Manchin, whose vote is a needed legislative linchpin for the Democrats.
Additionally, Mother Jones reported that the senator had a two-step plan to hit the eject button from the Democrats.

The first step involved sending a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., renouncing his Democratic leadership position as the Senate Democrats’ communications and policy vice chair to pressure Schumer into lowering the bill&#39;s costs.
If Schumer didn’t budge, Manchin would have reportedly changed his voter registration to independent, according to the report.

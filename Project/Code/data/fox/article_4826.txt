Tells CBS he’s not sure it’s his computer.
Hunter Biden convinced his father Joe in early 2017 to put out a statement approving of the affair he was having with his deceased brother Beau&#39;s widow, Hallie Biden, telling Joe that if he didn&#39;t, the relationship would &#34;seem wrong.&#34;
&#34;&#39;Dad,&#39; I told him, &#39;if people find out, but they think you&#39;re not approving of this, it makes it seem wrong,&#34; Hunter Biden wrote in his book, &#34;Beautiful Things,&#34; to be released April 6. A copy of the book was obtained by Fox News.
He approached his father only after he was put &#34;in a box&#34; by a reporter calling to confirm or deny the relationship. Biden had left the vice presidency only a month before, according to Hunter Biden. He told his father he and Hallie were &#34;incredibly lucky&#34; to have found each other.
He suggested Biden&#39;s grandchildren would pay the price emotionally if the former vice president didn&#39;t make a positive statement about the affair. &#34;&#39;The kids have to know there&#39;s nothing wrong with this, and the one person who can tell them that is you,&#39;&#34; Hunter pleaded.
The senior Biden was reluctant but finally agreed to put out a statement:
&#34;We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness. They have mine and Jill&#39;s full and complete support and we are happy for them.&#34;
HUNTER BIDEN SAYS IN MEMOIR HE WOULDN’T TAKE BURISMA JOB AGAIN BUT INSISTS IT WASN’T ‘UNETHICAL’
The next day the news broke, and according to Hunter, &#34;it was the beginning of the end.&#34;
In fact, rather than putting their lives back together, Hunter says he and Hallie were living &#34;lives of quiet desperation&#34; that were now on &#34;full display&#34; for the public and noted he was continuing his long history of substance abuse after &#34;backsliding&#34; following rehab. 
&#34;I was madly trying to hold on to a slice of my brother, and I think Hallie was doing the same,&#34; Hunter wrote.
Neither had planned on a long-term relationship, but now they felt they needed to try to make it stick.
&#34;If we weren&#39;t all in, we worried, the relationship would be perceived as a salacious fling,&#34; he wrote. &#34;So we tried to make something work that, in hindsight, was never in the cards.&#34;

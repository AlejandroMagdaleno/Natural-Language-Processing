Carley Shimkus breaks down this and other headlines in ‘Fox &amp;amp; Trends.’
Twitter accidentally took &#34;enforcement action&#34; on Republican Rep. Devin Nunes’ account but said it has &#34;since been reversed.&#34;
Nunes, R-Calif., was locked out of his
 account 
this week for about 10 minutes, a source told Fox News, after Twitter’s automated systems took action on the account for failing complete an anti-spam challenge.
TWITTER SAYS TRUMP WOULDN&#39;T BE ALLOWED BACK ON THE PLATFORM EVEN IF HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN
&#34;Our automated systems took enforcement action on the account in error and it has since been reversed,&#34; a Twitter spokesperson told Fox News. &#34;The enforcement action was taken as a result of the account’s failure to complete an anti-spam challenge that we regularly deploy across the service.&#34;
Twitter said the error only affected Nunes&#39; account, but that it &#34;deploy[s] anti-spam challenges all the time.&#34; 
In recent months, Nunes has largely stopped using Twitter and instead uses Parler. 
&#34;Eerily quiet here in the Twitter Sewer,&#34; Nunes tweeted on his personal account. &#34;Thought for a second I went to MySpace by accident. Many people I follow have been vaparized by left wing tech tyrants.&#34; 
He added: &#34;Hopefully they will reappear on Parler and Rumble.&#34; 
Nunes, in 2019, filed a lawsuit against Twitter seeking $250 million in compensatory damages and $350,000 in punitive damages against the company and a handful of its users, accusing them of &#34;shadow-banning conservatives.&#34;
The lawsuit alleged defamation, conspiracy and negligence.
A Virginia judge last year ruled that Nunes’ case against the social media giant had no merit.
The judge said that federal law — Section 230 — prevents social media platforms from being held liable for posts made by third-party users.
Republicans have questioned whether social media giants should still be afforded liability protections under Section 230 — a rule that shields social media companies from being held liable for content on their platforms while allowing them to moderate that content.

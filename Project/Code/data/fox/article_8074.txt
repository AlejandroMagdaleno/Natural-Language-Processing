&#39;Fox News Live&#39; panel weighs in on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo&#39;s sexual harassment probe and the White House colluding with Facebook to crack down on COVID social media posts.
Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., blasted President Joe Biden’s Justice Department Friday after the DOJ announced it was dropping a civil rights probe into New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s handling of the coronavirus in nursing homes.
&#34;It is outrageous that the Department of Justice refuses to investigate the deadly ‘must admit’ orders issued by governors in New York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan that resulted in the deaths of thousands of senior citizens,&#34; the minority whip said in a 
statement
 Friday. 
LEADER OF CUOMO IMPEACHMENT PROBE WARNS OF &#39;SEVERE REPERCUSSIONS&#39; AFTER AIDE&#39;S COMMENT
&#34;Where is the justice for nursing home victims and their grieving families? These deadly orders contradicted the CDC’s guidance, and needlessly endangered the most vulnerable among us to the deadly COVID-19 virus,&#34; the Louisiana Republican added. &#34;Even worse, Governor Cuomo in New York intentionally tried to cover up the true death toll resulting from his mandate. Grieving families deserve answers and accountability. It’s unconscionable that Biden’s Department of Justice refuses to investigate the deadly actions that went against CDC’s medical guidance taken in these states.&#34;
The DOJ 
told
 Republican lawmakers Friday that it will not pursue an investigation into the Cuomo nursing home scandal but a separate investigation by federal prosecutors into the matter will continue.

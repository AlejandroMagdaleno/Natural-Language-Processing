The recall campaign against 
California Gov. Gavin Newsom
 – once considered a pipe dream in a state firmly in the grip of 
Democrats
 – is nearing its threshold to qualify for a ballot. 
Should it lead to a recall election, and should Newsom be removed from office, it would mark the second time in less than 20 years such an event has taken place in 
California
. That another Republican-led recall campaign has made it this far, has evoked discussion as to whether Republicans might be able to regain a foothold in the Golden State. Others, however, remain more cautious on such pronouncements. 

      Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., arrives for the House Judiciary Committee markup on the Justice in Policing Act in the Capitol Visitor Center on Wednesday, June 17, 2020.
      
(Reuters)
Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., was a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the 2003 recall election to remove Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, from office. McClintock came in 
third place
, behind Democratic candidate Cruz Bustamante, and Republican candidate 
Arnold Schwarzenegger
, who ultimately won, and was re-elected in 2006. 
&#34;My fear is that 2003 may have been California&#39;s last off-ramp on the road to ruin,&#34; McClintock told Fox News in an interview. &#34;In 2003, the Democrats had an eight-point registration advantage. Today, they hold a 22-point advantage.&#34;
In the nearly 20 years since Davis was ousted from office, Democrats have solidified a &#34;hardcore left&#34; majority in both houses of the state legislatures, McClintock said. 
&#34;We&#39;re … 18 years now farther down that road to ruin. The impact of these policies of the left has been very consistent,&#34; McClintock said. &#34;Wherever they seize control, you see failing schools, skyrocketing taxes, rampant homelessness, rising violent crime, skyrocketing housing prices, skyrocketing energy prices, fleeing businesses and ultimately people leaving.&#34; 
He added: &#34;So that sets up a negative feedback loop where the 
more people leave
, the worse things get, the worse things get, the more people leave. And I fear we&#39;re slowly, inevitably becoming a gigantic Detroit that just happens to have better weather.&#34;
As of Tuesday, organizers of the Newsom recall campaign say they have collected more than 1.4 of the 1.5 million needed to qualify for a ballot. Their goal is to collect upwards of 2 million signatures ahead of the March 10 deadline to compensate for the signatures that will inevitably be invalidated. 
CALIFORNIA LAWMAKER ENCOURAGES TEACHERS TO OPT-OUT OF FUNDING GOV. NEWSOM AS RECALL NEARS THRESHOLD
Kevin Faulconer
, the former mayor of San Diego, and 
John Cox
, Newsom’s challenger in the 2018 election, have both announced their bid for governor. But even if either candidate – both Republicans – were to replace Newsom, their options would be significantly limited by California’s solidly Democratic legislature.  
California’s legislature, McClintock noted, could &#34;pass any law they want over a governor’s veto and nullify any act that he takes.&#34; 
&#34;I hope I&#39;m wrong and I certainly wish the signature drive and all of the Republican candidates Godspeed. But conditions have deteriorated very rapidly over these 17 years. And yet I do wonder if things can be set right,&#34; McClintock said. 
But McClintock acknowledged the high stakes of the recall, given what he described as the &#34;devastating&#34; lockdown and their impact on the well-being of Californians of all ages. 
&#34;The lockdowns have … robbed our children of a year of their education. (They’ve) destroyed hundreds of thousands of small businesses, cost millions of people their jobs … And I think that that is becoming clear to so many Californians that they feel the need to do something,&#34; McClintock said. &#34;The big question is going to be, do the people of California actually have the will to act and the wisdom to change course before it&#39;s too late?&#34;

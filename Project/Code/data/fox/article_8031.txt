Kious addresses the claims made by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, as well as those of the hair stylist Speaker Pelosi interacted with during her visit.
It&#39;s been nearly a year since former 
San Francisco
 salon owner Erica Kious shuttered her business after exposing House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 
for getting her hair washed and blown out despite 
coronavirus
 restrictions.
&#34;I thought if I ever lost my business, I would have lost it in an earthquake,&#34; Kious said Tuesday at Heritage Action’s Save Our Paychecks Tour kick-off event in Fresno. &#34;Never did I ever think that I would have lost everything I worked for by leftist politics. Gone.&#34;
Fox News
 obtained surveillance video last summer 
of Pelosi visiting the salon for a hair wash and blowout, despite local ordinances keeping salons closed amid the coronavirus pandemic.
PELOSI SAYS NEWSOM RECALL IS ‘NOT GOOD FOR CHILDREN AND OTHER LIVING THINGS’
Pelosi, D-Calif. later claimed she was &#34;set up,&#34; which Kious denied. 
&#34;I never set her up. That was a lie. I’ve had cameras in there since I opened. I didn’t put them in there I didn&#39;t turn them on. They&#39;re on all the time,&#34; said Kious, who noted she was traveling when she saw the video footage of Pelosi. 
The former owner said Pelosi was serviced by an independent stylist who rents chairs in her salon. Kious said she decided to share the 
now-viral security camera
 
footage when she found the Speaker indoors without a mask in what she called a &#34;hurtful&#34; display of hypocrisy. 
&#34;I went through the exact footage of her walking through my reception area with no mask,&#34; Kious said Tuesday. &#34;I literally felt like she took a knife and stabbed me in the stomach. … I know inside me what she did was wrong, completely wrong.&#34;
MODERATE DEMS PRESSURE PELOSI TO HOLD INFRASTRUCTURE VOTE, SAY HOW RECONCILIATION WILL AFFECT DEBT, INFLATION
Nearly 40,000 small businesses closed in California by September 2020, which was around the time of Pelosi&#39;s visit, according to Heritage Action, a conservative grassroots organization. Thousands more have closed since.
Last September, Kious said on &#34;
Tucker Carlson Tonight
&#34; that she was shutting her doors for good after controversy over the visit destroyed her business. She told host 
Tucker Carlson
 that she was attacked for exposing Pelosi.

&#34;I started to just get a ton of phone calls, text messages, emails, all my Yelp reviews … saying that they hope I go under and that I fail,&#34; Kious said at the time. &#34;So just a lot of negativity towards my business.&#34;

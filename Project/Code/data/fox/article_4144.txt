Rep. Rodney Davis and GOP members call out House Speaker Nancy Pelosi&#39;s metal detector hypocrisy.
Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., on Wednesday announced a formal appeal of 
House
 Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi’s
, D-Calif., fines that he has incurred for refusing to follow metal detector protocols.
&#34;Today, with the assistance of my private counsel, I appealed the fines I incurred as a result of my refusal to abide by Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s unconstitutional placement of magnetometers in front of the entrance to the Floor of the House of Representatives,&#34; Clyde wrote in a statement.
Clyde claimed installation of the magnetometers was part of an effort to treat Republican lawmakers &#34;as a threat.&#34;
&#34;The ongoing militarization of Capitol Hill, including the placement of metal fencing, razor wire, and the deployment of National Guard troops, are also part of this perverse strategy,&#34; he wrote.

In a YouTube video, Clyde worried that Democrats might be careening down a path toward introducing legislation that would create a &#34;litmus test&#34; for anyone who wants to serve in the armed forces or government.
The Georgia congressman said he filed his appeal with the House Ethics Committee.
A spokesperson for Pelosi&#39;s office did not return Fox News&#39; request for comment.

As 
previously reported by Fox News
, Republicans are pushing Pelosi to pay her own fine for bypassing the magnetometers.
A first-time offense generates a $5,000 penalty. But continued noncompliance ups the fine to $10,000 for additional violations.
The metal detectors were installed at the House in the wake of the Jan. 6 siege on Capitol Hill and have been opposed by some Republicans from the outset.

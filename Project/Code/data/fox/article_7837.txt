Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., shared his big idea of imposing term limits on members of Congress in a discussion with Fox News. 
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas
, joined five other Republicans on Monday in moving to restrict the number of times members of 
Congress
 can be reelected.
The legislation revives Cruz&#39;s earlier idea for a constitutional amendment on term limits. If ratified, the measure would prevent senators from serving more than two six-year terms and House members from serving more than three two-year terms.
&#34;Every year, Congress spends billions of dollars on giveaways for the well-connected: Washington insiders get taxpayer money and members of Congress get re-elected, all while the system fails the American people,&#34; Cruz said in a press release.
SEN. RICK SCOTT&#39;S BIG IDEA: IMPOSE CONGRESSIONAL TERM LIMITS
&#34;It’s no wonder that the vast majority of Americans from every political stripe – Republicans, Democrats, and Independents – overwhelmingly support congressional term limits,&#34; he wrote. &#34;The rise of political careerism in today’s Congress is a sharp departure from what the Founders intended for our federal governing bodies. I have long called for this solution for the brokenness of Washington, D.C., and I will continue fighting to hold career politicians accountable. As I have done in the past, I urge my colleagues to submit this constitutional amendment to the states for speedy ratification.&#34;
Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Pat Toomey, R-Pa., Todd Young, R-Ind., Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Mike Braun, R-Ind. joined Cruz in his effort Monday.
&#34;I have long been a supporter of congressional term limits, which would infuse Congress with real-world experience, perspectives, and sensibilities,&#34; said Toomey, who has served in the Senate since 2011. &#34;Term limits also have the added benefit of being supported by supermajorities of Republicans and Democrats.&#34;
A 1995 Supreme Court Case, U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton, held that the only way to impose term limits on Congress would be through a rare constitutional amendment -- there have only been 27 in American history.
While term limits have enjoyed bipartisan support, they&#39;ve also encountered some opposition.

Writing for the Brookings Institute, George Washington University professor Casey Burgat argued in 2018 that term limits would, among other things, limit voters&#39; power and strip away the benefit of having experienced lawmakers in the policymaking process.
He added that for states and foreign governments, &#34;
studies regularly find
 that many of the corruptive, ‘swampy,’ influences advocates contend would be curtailed by instituting term limits are, in fact, exacerbated by their implementation.&#34;

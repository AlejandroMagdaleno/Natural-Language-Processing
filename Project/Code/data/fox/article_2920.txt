Mark Steyn weighs in on the NY governor leaving his governor&#39;s mansion as he begs mansion staffers to take the dog off his hands on &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39;
Disgraced 
New York 
Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 responded late Monday following a report that he tried to give his 
dog 
Captain away during his final days in office.
The Albany Times Union reported, citing two state 
police
 
sources, that Cuomo, a Democrat, left the dog behind at the Executive Mansion before he stayed with one of his sisters in Westchester County last week. 
Cuomo asked mansion staffers to take Captain, and one volunteered, but the dog – which has a history of biting people – was returned to the mansion just a few days later, the sources told the paper.
The governor, who officially resigned at 11:59 p.m. Monday, denied the claims on Twitter. 
CUOMO USES COVID-19 PANDEMIC ALERT TO DELIVER FAREWELL MESSAGE TO NEW YORKERS
&#34;Some people just can&#39;t get the facts straight,&#34; Cuomo tweeted. &#34;Yes, I was downstate monitoring storm response for a few days, but Captain and I are a man and his dog. He is part of our family and that’s the way it will always be.&#34;
Cuomo’s top adviser and spokesman Richard Azzopardi suggested that the arrangement was only &#34;temporary&#34; because the governor is planning on taking a vacation.
&#34;Captain is part of the governor&#39;s family and for your nameless ill-informed source to imply they&#39;ve been trying to give him away is untrue,&#34; Azzopardi told the paper in a statement. 
CUOMO COMMUTES 4 CONVICTED MURDERERS&#39; SENTENCES IN FINAL HOURS AS GOVERNOR
&#34;Someone offered to watch him for a few days while the transition was ongoing but for that to be weaponized and morph from a game of telephone into the pages of your paper is absurd — now excuse us we&#39;re preparing for a major storm,&#34; he added, referring to Tropical Storm Henri.
Cuomo announced he would step down on Aug. 10 after the New York state attorney general alleged he sexually harassed 11 women, including staffers, during his three terms in office. 
He is also being investigated for his handling of nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic.

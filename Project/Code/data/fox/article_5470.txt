Los Angeles
 Mayor Eric Garcetti is warning unvaccinated city employees that they should be prepared to lose their jobs if they don’t comply with the city’s employee vaccine mandate by December.
&#34;The city&#39;s employee vaccine mandate is critical to protecting the health and safety of our workforce and the Angelenos we serve,&#34; the mayor 
said
  Wednesday. &#34;Employees must be vaccinated by December 18, and we are putting a rigorous testing program into place in the meantime. Let me be clear: Any employee who refuses to be vaccinated by this date should be prepared to lose their job.&#34;

The city’s move, 
announced in July
,  to force employees to be vaccinated has received stiff pushback from many residents and officials including Los Angeles County Sheriff
 
Alex Villanueva who has said publicly he will not enforce the mandate within his department.
&#34;This is so politicized, I cannot in good conscience impose a mandate like that,&#34; he 
told
 Fox News earlier this month, saying that the mandate is &#34;poorly thought out, poorly executed.&#34;

&#34;I’m not going to be part of that,&#34; the sheriff added.

U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess, who just visited the region, with a firsthand account of the crisis.
Border Patrol
 on Wednesday released a shocking video of smugglers abandoning a 5-year-old girl and a 3-year-old girl at the border in the New Mexico desert in the middle of the night -- after dropping them from over a 14-foot border barrier.
The video, released by El Paso Sector Chief Patrol Agent Gloria Chavez, shows what she said was two smugglers scaling the fence and dropping each child onto the ground and harsh surface, before tossing what appears to be some belongings down.

The two smugglers then are seen fleeing from the southern side of the fence.
Chavez said the little girls were left &#34;miles from the nearest residence.&#34; They were picked up by agents after they were spotted via surveillance technology.

&#34;I’m appalled by the way these smugglers viciously dropped innocent children from a 14-foot border barrier last night. If not for the vigilance of our agents using mobile technology, these two tender-aged siblings would have been exposed to the harsh elements of desert environment for hours,&#34; Chavez said.
&#34;We are currently working with our law enforcement partners in Mexico and attempting to identify these ruthless human smugglers so as to hold them accountable to the fullest extent of the law,&#34; she added.

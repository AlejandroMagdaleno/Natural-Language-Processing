Kate Chatfield, a senior director in far-left District Attorney 
Chesa Boudin&#39;s office
, downplayed safety concerns amid a 
nationwide crime spike
. 
Chatfield was reacting to a Twitter user who said that &#34;every single one of my friends right now is considering leaving&#34; San Francisco due to crime fears. &#34;My friends are scared for their children, and their husbands are scared for their wives,&#34; the user wrote. 
SAN FRANCISCO CAR BREAK-INS UP OVER 750% IN SOME AREAS, POLICE SAY
 
&#34;&#39;Husbands are scared for their wives&#39; —-your reminder that the ‘crime surge’ crowd shares the same ideology as The Birth of a Nation,&#34; Chatfield 
fired back
, referring to an early 20th-century White supremacist film. 
Chatfield locked her Twitter account – making it so only her followers can see her tweets – after her comment about crime fears drew sharp criticism online. Boudin&#39;s office didn&#39;t immediately return Fox News&#39; request for comment.

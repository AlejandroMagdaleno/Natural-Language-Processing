Finance expert Dan Rocatto joins &#39;Fox &amp; Friends First&#39; to talk about inflation and the impact on the 2022 midterms, wealthy Americans leaving the country in large numbers
An 
Illinois
 
Democrat
 claimed that economists are saying &#34;a little bit of inflation&#34; is a &#34;good thing&#34; as prices around the country surge.
Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., made the inflation claim while speaking at the Palatine Village, Illinois town hall on Saturday.
Casten claimed that, generally, economists agree that a small amount of inflation – the devaluation of the dollar through rising prices – is a boon to the economy.
FOX NEWS POLL: 83% WORRY ABOUT INFLATION, MAJORITY SAYS BENEFITS HURTING ECONOMY
&#34;There&#39;s also, frankly, I think there’s a general consensus among economists that a little bit of inflation would actually be a good thing,&#34; the lawmaker added. &#34;Because the Federal Reserve has a mandate to keep interest rates manageable but non-zero and inflation manageable but not excessive.&#34;
A recent Fox News poll revealed that 83% of Americans are &#34;extremely&#34; or &#34;very&#34; concerned about inflation, with inflation being a top level concern for both Democrats and Republicans.
Casten said the Federal Reserve has &#34;cut interest rates&#34; several times since the 2008 recession and &#34;inflation didn’t go up.&#34;
&#34;So then they had to keep trying to figure out ‘how do I make sure,’ because people would like to get a little bit more money next year, right? That’s inflation,&#34; Casten claimed. &#34;How do you make sure that you’ve got, sort of, an acceptable level of inflation?&#34;
The Democrat congressman said the &#34;result&#34; was the Federal Reserve purchasing &#34;trillions of dollars of government securities&#34; to pump funds into the economy.
&#34;So the Fed actually has a whole lot of very unconventional ammunition that they would love to unload but they can’t until they see inflation pick up a little bit,&#34; Casten claimed, calling the inflation the country is seeing &#34;transitory inflation.&#34;
National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesperson Mike Berg told Fox News in a Monday statement that it was odd to hear the congressman talk up Americans paying a higher price for goods and services across the board.

&#34;It is bizarre to hear Sean Casten praise the fact that Americans are paying higher prices for everyday goods and services,&#34; Berg said. &#34;House Democrats are completely out of touch with middle-class Americans.&#34;
The country is currently seeing inflation rise as demand rises and supply chain issues abound.
Casten’s office did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

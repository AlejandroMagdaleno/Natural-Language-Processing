TIFFANY SMILEY
: 
I’m running for the United States Senate to bring common-sense solutions to the unique problems that are facing Washington state families and our brilliant youth here in the state.
... 
Look, my opponent is a career politician. She’s been in for over thirty years and if we’ve seen anything over the last year, it’s that people are struggling. I’m a mom, I’m a nurse, I’m a caregiver, I’m a small business owner, and I am talking to people every single day in our great state and they are struggling. Career politicians are not the answer to our future.

I have a proven record of taking on the government and winning for the greater good of people. I took on the VA when others said it was impossible and that I was actually wasting my time, but we won. So I have no doubt going into the future that we can do great work here in Washington state, and I am ready to be that voice.

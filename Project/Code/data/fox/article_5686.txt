Prominent historian tells &#39;Special Report&#39; trial will &#39;deeply divide&#39; American public
Former President 
Donald Trump
 is expected to meet with House Minority Leader 
Kevin McCarthy
, R-Calif., on Thursday ahead of his Senate impeachment trial, Fox News has learned.
A source told Fox News that at one point Trump told McCarthy that he bore some of the blame for the Capitol riot
The meeting will occur in South Florida just weeks after the Jan. 6 
Capitol riots
 that many have blamed on Trump and over which he was impeached by the House a week later for &#34;incitement of insurrection.&#34; 
In the aftermath, McCarthy opposed impeaching Trump but was open to a censure resolution. But McCarthy more recently expressed concerns about GOP conference chairwoman Liz Cheney&#39;s vote to impeach Trump.
Trump&#39;s trial, the first for a former U.S. president, is set to start the week of Feb. 8.

Just as the Senate passed a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in a legislative triumph for 
President Biden
, the news cycle was overtaken by New York Gov.

 announcing his retirement.

NY GOV. CUOMO RESIGNS AMID SEXUAL HARASSMENT SCANDAL
Fox News, CNN and MSNBC all had Cuomo&#39;s resignation as the lead stories on their respective pages, as did ABC News, NBC News and CBS News.
&#34;Cuomo to resign amid sexual harassment scandal,&#34; was emblazoned atop the New York Times homepage, with &#34;Senate Passes $1 Trillion Infrastructure Bill&#34; underneath. Likewise, the Washington Post had Cuomo&#39;s resignation on top of its site, with the bill&#39;s passage below.

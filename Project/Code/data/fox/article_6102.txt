House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton call for a probe into the Capitol riot; former Deputy National Security Adviser KT McFarland reacts.
Democrats&#39;
 interest in probing the Capitol riot to find a potential link to 
Russian
 intervention shows that they are ignoring the real enemy of the United States, former deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland said on Wednesday.
&#34;The Democrats, particularly Hillary Clinton, the Biden administration, the Obama Administration going back. They never saw China as the real threat,&#34; McFarland told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
.&#34;
&#34;They always thought, well, it&#39;s Russia or it’s terrorists or it’s the Middle East or climate change and it was like a willful blindness not to accept the real issue is China. I think that continues today.&#34;
CLINTON, PELOSI BLASTED BY LEFT FOR CONTINUING TO PUSH &#39;RUSSIAGATE&#39;: &#39;THEY&#39;RE NEVER GOING TO GIVE UP&#39;
Hillary Clinton
 and 
Nancy Pelosi
 are facing backlash from their own side of the aisle over their ongoing pursuit to find any ties between 
President Trump
 and 
Russia
. 
Clinton suggested, in an interview with the House speaker that aired on her podcast &#34;You and Me Both&#34;, that her 2016 rival had &#34;other agendas&#34; while serving as president and predicted that the truth will eventually be known. 
&#34;I hope, historically, we will find out who he&#39;s beholden to, who pulls his strings. I would love to see his phone records to see if he was talking to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin the day the insurgents invaded our Capitol,&#34; Clinton said.
The former secretary of state then asked Pelosi if she agreed with setting up a &#34;9/11-type commission&#34; to investigate &#34;everything&#34; that happened, including potential Russian involvement. 
&#34;I would love to see his phone records to see whether he was talking to Putin the day that the insurgents invaded our Capitol,&#34; she said.

McFarland said Clinton and Pelosi are making a &#34;grave mistake&#34; by elevating the threat from Putin above the threat from China. 
&#34;It’s looming and the Chinese have every intention of replacing the United States as the dominant military, economic, cyber, technological power within the decade.&#34;

John Saunders, who owns a property near Laredo, says, &#39;We got a real problem down here.&#39; 
South 
Texas
 rancher John Saunders told &#34;
America Reports
&#34; on Wednesday &#34;it’s time to open the curtain and let people see what it’s really like down here&#34; regarding the Biden administration&#39;s border crisis.
Some members of the 
media
 have called out the administration for denying them access to what many believe to be a crisis of its own making.
Migrants have entered his family’s property at least 20 times within the year, Saunders said, adding, &#34;We got a real problem down here.&#34;
The rancher, who owns a property near Laredo, noted migrants sometimes use cars to race to the border and have damaged his fence. 
&#34;It really adds up,&#34; he told host
 John Roberts
, noting repairs can cost up to $6,000.
TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT REPORTS COVID OUTBREAK, NO &#39;USEABLE RUNNING WATER&#39; AT MIGRANT HOLDING FACILITY
&#34;We have a property on the highway not far from the river and when [migrants are] getting chased by law enforcement, usually human smugglers, they just turn off the highway at full speed, mind you, and just go straight through the fence … [and] go &#39;til they can’t go anymore, then they bail out and they are running across the property,&#34; Saunders said.
He added that migrants typically &#34;disappear into the South Texas brush, which ... is pretty thick.&#34; 
Saunders said he wanted to speak out because of the &#34;consistent property damage&#34; and to share photos of what it’s like in the area amid the migrant surge. 
Biden has scrapped a number of Trump&#39;s policies, which included having asylum seekers remain in Mexico instead of staying in the U.S. while they wait for their cases to be heard.
Saunders noted on Wednesday he has &#34;never really had an issue with feeling like I was in danger at all.&#34;

As 
President Biden’s
 popularity among American voters continues to decline, so does his clout among fellow 
Democrats
. 
An increasing number of Biden allies have voiced their disappointment in his handling of issues like the 
border
 crisis, Afghanistan and the Democratic-controlled 
Congress
, where two major pieces of legislation furthering his domestic agenda remain stalled due to party infighting.
The latest crack in the party foundation became evident Sunday after Virginia&#39;s Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe, who campaigned with Biden in northern Virginia less than three months ago, said he was &#34;frustrated&#34; with the president and Democrats in Congress.
PENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRAT HITS BIDEN ON BORDER CRISIS, RECONCILIATION BILL &#39;ZERO COST&#39; CLAIM
&#34;We have got frustration with Washington,&#34; McAuliffe said in a CNN interview. &#34;Why haven&#39;t we passed this infrastructure bill? It passed the U.S. Senate with 69 votes two months ago. I have been very straight on television. We&#39;re tired of the chitty chat up in Washington. Get in a room and get this figured out. … They&#39;re paid to get up in Washington, get this done.&#34;
The comments came days after McAuliffe said Biden is currently &#34;unpopular&#34; in Virginia.
Sarah Longwell, a moderate Republican strategist who became a vocal supporter of Biden in 2020, 
told Politico
 there is a &#34;malaise&#34; among Democratic voters who don’t feel their lives have improved under Biden, and that very few are blaming Republicans for the mess in Washington, where Democratic Party infighting has stalled a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package.
Biden and Democrats in Washington &#34;are in a morass of fighting with each over bills that nobody knows what’s in,&#34; Longwell said. &#34;It just looks like a cluster.&#34;
MCAULIFFE CALLS BIDEN &#39;UNPOPULAR&#39; IN VIRGINIA AMID BELLWETHER ELECTION
Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., a moderate Democrat who wanted an immediate vote on the infrastructure bill, 
told the New York Times
 last week that the way Biden is governing &#34;doesn’t reflect the skills I know he must have from his years as a legislator.&#34;   
Rep. Jim Costa, D-Calif., also 
recently criticized
 Biden over his pitch to Congress for infrastructure, calling it &#34;disappointing&#34; and saying he spent most of his time talking about the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package.
&#34;Well, if it&#39;s not a priority for him, then maybe it&#39;s just not a priority period,&#34; Costa said. &#34;It&#39;s a priority for me.&#34;
Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., criticized Biden’s lack of involvement early on in the negotiation process and said he was disappointed in his lack of communication with moderates.
&#34;We&#39;re kind of late to the party, a little disappointed,&#34; Schrader 
told the Daily Beast
 last month. ‘They needed to be more vigorous earlier on, that hopefully it&#39;ll make up for here down the final stretch.&#34;
PSAKI GRILLED ON BIDEN&#39;S &#39;REALLY TERRIBLE POLLS,&#39; BLAMES DELTA VARIANT AND UNVACCINATED AMERICANS
Another point of contention in the party is Biden’s handling of the southern border, which has seen a massive influx of migrants in recent months.
&#34;I will be very honest with you and tell you I am a little bit disappointed. I know that the President assigned responsibility for the border crisis to the Vice President,&#34; Rep. Susan Wild, D-Penn., said during a telephone town hall on Tuesday. &#34;I&#39;m a little bit disappointed I haven&#39;t seen much in the way of results.&#34;
Former Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke, a likely Texas gubernatorial candidate, slammed Biden for not anticipating the migrant surge in a 
scathing op-ed
 last month for El Paso Matters.
&#34;None of this should have been a surprise to our government,&#34; O&#39;Rourke wrote.
Meanwhile, Biden’s average approval rating among voters has been on a downward slide since June, teetering at about 38%, the lowest of his presidency. He&#39;s seen the steepest drop among independent voters, which could have major electoral implications.

Some Democrats hypothesize that a major legislative victory for Biden could turn those numbers around.
&#34;On substance, the president’s programs are what people seem to want. Like everything else, it&#39;s the sausage making that&#39;s causing problems with the polls,&#34; Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., told Politico. &#34;There are one or two [senators] that will keep him from getting to 50.&#34;

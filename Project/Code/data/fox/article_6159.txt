Michigan
 Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission rejecting a request to start their meetings with the Pledge of Allegiance, with some members calling the pledge &#34;divisive&#34; and &#34;contentious.&#34; 
The first item of business on the Michigan Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission&#39;s docket Thursday was a request by Commissioner Doug Clark to recite the Pledge of Allegiance prior to the group&#39;s meetings to decide how both state and federal congressional districts would look in the state.
During the 
Zoom meeting
, Commissioner Rebecca Sztetla said that when she traveled to other groups’ meetings, it was a &#34;mixed bag&#34; of whether they recited the pledge or not and that she doesn’t &#34;see how that adds anything to the work of the commission.&#34;
Sztetla also said she doesn’t see how the pledge &#34;advances&#34; the work of the committee and that reciting it will only &#34;add time&#34; to meetings.
&#34;And then I also just think that it’s kind of odd that we’re not a federal board, we’re not a federal agency — we’re an independent commission of Michigan, not the federal government,&#34; said Sztetla. &#34;So why would we be pledging allegiance to the federal government? It just seems a little odd to me.&#34;

Sztetla then said that her &#34;big&#34; concern was that she feels the Pledge of Allegiance is &#34;unnecessarily divisive.&#34;
&#34;And then my other concern – and this is really the big one – is I feel it’s unnecessarily divisive,&#34; she said. &#34;Especially if we’re going to be having public meetings where we’re starting out with the pledge.&#34;
The commissioner pointed to the trend of some athletes and spectators &#34;taking a knee&#34; for the Pledge of Allegiance &#34;or other patriotic acts with respect to the federal government&#34; such as the national anthem.
&#34;It’s just creating a divisive atmosphere before our public hearings, which I think is the last thing we want,&#34; said Sztetla. &#34;We want everyone to feel comfortable.&#34;
RACIST GRAFFITI IN MICHIGAN DORM WRITTEN BY BLACK STUDENT: REPORT
Commission Chair Brittni Kellom called the pledge &#34;contentious&#34; and said she would not lead it. Kellom was joined in rebuking the pledge by Democrat Commissioner Dustin Witjes, who said he &#34;vehemently&#34; disagreed with reciting the pledge.
The commission didn&#39;t immediately return a request for comment. 
According to the website, the commission &#34;will be composed of 13 randomly selected Michigan registered voters: four who affiliate with the Democratic Party, four who affiliate with the Republican Party, and five who do not affiliate with either major political party.&#34;
However, even though the commission works as an independent body, the commission hired attorney Bruce Adelson, who has donated to 
Democratic candidates
 in the past.
In a news release sent Friday, Ted Goodman, communications director for the Michigan Republican Party, criticized the commission for hiring Adelson.

&#34;The Redistricting Commission must remain non-partisan as it conducts it&#39;s work to re-evaluate legislative districts across Michigan,&#34; said Goodman. &#34;The Commission must re-evaluate this hire or bring on a second attorney to remove any perception of partisan, political bias.&#34;

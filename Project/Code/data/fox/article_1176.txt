President Biden
 and First Lady Jill Biden released an Easter video Sunday in which the president insisted that Americans get 
vaccinated
 against 
COVID-19
, calling it a &#34;moral obligation.&#34;
The Easter video, released on the president&#39;s official Twitter account, has references to God, Pope Francis, and the New Testament, but it does not mention Jesus.
&#34;We share the sentiments of Pope Francis, who has said that getting vaccinated is a moral obligation, one that can save your life and the lives of others,&#34; the President said. &#34;By getting vaccinated and encouraging your congregations and your communities to get vaccinated, we not only can beat this virus, we can also hasten the day when we can celebrate the holidays together.&#34;
The president emphasized that &#34;the virus is not gone&#34; and noted that many continue to experience hardship as a result of the pandemic.

For a second year, most will be apart from their families, friends, the full congregations that fill us with joy.&#34;
But the Bidens expressed optimism that Easter presents hope for better times.

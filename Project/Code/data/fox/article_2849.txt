The impeachment investigation of New York Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
, which began in March, is almost over, the 
New York
 State Assembly announced Thursday.
The Assembly Judiciary Committee had law firm Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell conduct an independent inquiry and have asked Cuomo to provide any materials he would like to submit on his own behalf as the investigation comes to an end.
&#34;We write to inform you that the Committee’s investigation is nearing completion and the Assembly will soon consider potential articles of impeachment against your client,&#34; the firm told Cuomo. &#34;Accordingly, we invite you to provide any additional evidence or written submissions that you would like the committee to consider before its work concludes.&#34;

The Assembly also stated its attorneys had issued a subpoena to Cuomo for materials related to their investigation, but that he had yet to turn them over. &#34;The Committee continues to expect full compliance from the governor.&#34;
Cuomo senior adviser Rich Azzopardi responded Thursday: &#34;The Assembly has said it is doing a full and thorough review of the complaints and has offered the governor and his team an opportunity to present facts and their perspective. The governor appreciates the opportunity. We will be cooperating.&#34;

Normally such a trial would be heard by the senators, the seven judges on the New York Court of Appeals, and the lieutenant governor. In the case of a governor&#39;s impeachment, the lieutenant governor and the president pro tempore of the Senate – who is currently Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins – are excluded because they are in the line of succession. Two thirds of the court is needed to convict, which would be 46 votes.
To date, 37 senators have gone on record supporting the progression of the impeachment process.

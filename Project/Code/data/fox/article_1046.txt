‘Fox News Sunday’ panel weighs in on mask mandate on Capitol Hill and the expiring eviction moratorium potentially impacting millions of Americans.
The 
Biden White House
 said Monday that it lacked the legal authority to extend the 
federal
 moratorium on evictions that expired over the weekend, putting pressure on states that have been &#34;too slow&#34; to disburse the billions of dollars in assistance to the millions of renters who face being thrown out of their 
homes
.
White House
 press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden would have &#34;strongly supported&#34; a decision by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to further extend its eviction moratorium, but noted that the Supreme Court declared in June that the CDC could not grant such an extension without congressional approval. The White House said Biden’s idea for a new, 30-day eviction moratorium focusing on counties with high 
infection
 rates was also shot down by the CDC.
BIDEN IGNORES PELOSI&#39;S CALL TO EXTEND EVICTION BAN DESPITE KAVANAUGH OPINION
&#34;To date, CDC Director 
Rochelle Walensky
 and her team have been unable to find legal authority for a new, targeted eviction moratorium,&#34; White House press secretary Psaki said in a statement Monday. &#34;Our team is redoubling efforts to identify all available legal authorities to provide necessary protections. In the meantime, the President will continue to do everything in his power to help renters from eviction.&#34;

Psaki said the administration was calling on individual states to extend or put in place evictions moratoria for at the least the next two months and &#34;challenging every landlord to hold off on evictions for the next 30 days.&#34;
During a White House press briefing Monday afternoon, Gene Sperling, who is responsible for overseeing the implementation of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, said more than a half-dozen times that Biden is &#34;double, triple and quadruple&#34; checking the administration&#39;s authority to extend the moratorium.

The 
State Department
 issued a joint international statement Wednesday essentially asking the Taliban to &#34;guarantee&#34; the protection of women and girls in 
Afghanistan
 following the hard-line Islamic militant group’s rapid takeover of the country since the U.S. withdrawal of 
troops
.
A statement signed by the U.S. and 20 other countries, including 
Australia
, 
Canada
, the

SENATORS WARN THAT THE TALIBAN ARE ALREADY SUPPRESSING RIGHTS OF  WOMEN, GIRLS IN AFGHANISTAN
&#34;We are deeply worried about Afghan women and girls, their rights to education, work and freedom of movement. We call on those in positions of power and authority across Afghanistan to guarantee their protection,&#34; the statement read. &#34;We in the international community stand ready to assist them with humanitarian aid and support, to ensure that their voices can be heard.&#34;
&#34;We will monitor closely how any future government ensures rights and freedoms that have become an integral part of the life of women and girls in Afghanistan during the last twenty years,&#34; the statement added.
Taliban insurgents swept Afghanistan with astonishing speed in recent days, reclaiming power over the country 20 years after being ousted by U.S.-led forces. Wednesday&#39;s joint letter did not mention the group by name.
TALIBAN CLAIMS IT&#39;LL BE MORE MODERATE, BUT KILLINGS CONTINUE IN AFGHANISTAN
Under the Taliban&#39;s former regime in the late 1990s, the group banned girls from attending school and women from appearing in public without full body coverings and male escorts. Violators of the laws faced public stonings, amputations and executions.
Now, in a propaganda effort to boost its image, the Taliban pledged to respect &#34;women’s rights&#34; and invited women to join its government in accordance with Islamic law. But reports from the ground paint a different picture. 
Reuters reported
 this week that women were being pulled from banking jobs and ordered into their homes, told only that male relatives could take their place.
Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations 
Nikki Haley
 reminded Americans in a tweet Wednesday morning that the Taliban is &#34;brutal terrorist organization&#34; that cannot be trusted.

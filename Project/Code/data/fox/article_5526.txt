FOX News&#39; Alicia Acuna reports live from the scene in Boulder, Colorado on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Rep. Lauren Boebert, 
R-Colo.
, was one of several lawmakers who expressed concern following reports that 
police
 had responded to an active shooter situation at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado on Monday.
Ten people were killed, including Eric Talley, 51, a police officer who had been with the Boulder police depart since 2010. The shooting occurred at King Soopers grocery store on Table Mesa Drive. 
Boebert, a controversial first-term congresswoman and gun rights advocate, spoke out against what she described as &#34;senseless violence.&#34; 
BOULDER &#39;ACTIVE SHOOTER&#39; REPORTED AT KING SOOPERS GROCERY STORE, POLICE SAY
&#34;As we continue to hear the news coming out of Boulder, I’m praying for the police, first responders, and those affected by this tragedy,&#34; Boebert said in a statement. &#34;May God be with us as we make sense of this senseless violence, and may we unify and not divide during this time.&#34;
Boebert is a native of Rifle, Colorado and the owner of Shooters Grill, a gun-themed restaurant. She drew scrutiny in recent months after stating a desire to carry a firearm on the House floor. In February, police confirmed that she was granted a concealed carry permit in Washington D.C.
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said he was &#34;closely monitoring&#34; the situation.
&#34;Like my fellow Coloradans, I am closely watching unfolding events at King Soopers in Boulder,&#34; Polis said. &#34;My prayers are with our fellow Coloradans in this time of sadness and grief as we learn more about the extent of the tragedy.&#34;
Colorado Sens. John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet also said they were monitoring reports on the incident.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said President Biden has been briefed on the situation.
Two police officers were seen escorting a shirtless man out of the grocery store in handcuffs. The man had blood running down his leg. 
Video from the scene showed a massive law enforcement presence, including SWAT teams and police helicopters. Police were heard announcing that the building was surrounded and that &#34;you need to surrender.&#34;

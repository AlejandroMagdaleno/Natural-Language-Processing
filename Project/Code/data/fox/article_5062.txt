Kushner, who also served in the White House, is writing a book, a source familiar told Fox News. 
Last month, Ivanka&#39;s husband started The Abraham Accords Peace Institute, a nonprofit, after working in the Trump administration on the Abraham Accords, which officials touted as a &#34;historic peace agreement&#34; between Israel and the United Arab Emirates that normalized relations and created bilateral agreements regarding &#34;investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications, technology, energy, health care, culture, the environment, the establishment of reciprocal embassies, and other areas of mutual benefit.&#34;

At the time, Israel and the UAE also said they will continue their efforts to &#34;achieve a just, comprehensive and enduring resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&#34;
But even as Kushner continues working on Trump-era policies outside of government, the New York Times reported that he wants a &#34;simpler&#34; relationship with former President Trump. 

      Kushner and his sons Theodore and Joseph appear to be enjoying their new life in Florida.

The &#39;Special Report&#39; All-Star panel of Brit Hume, Mara Liasson, and Fred Barnes give their analysis.
Twitter is &#34;actively working&#34; with the U.S. government to support the transition of accounts from the Trump administration to the Biden administration, Fox News has learned, which will take place Wednesday after President-elect Joe Biden is 
sworn in
 as 46th president of the United States.
&#34;As President-elect Biden is 
sworn in
 tomorrow, Twitter will facilitate the transfer of institutional White House Twitter accounts, such as @WhiteHouse, @POTUS, @VP, @FLOTUS, and @PressSec,&#34; a Twitter spokesperson told Fox News.
TWITTER SUSPENDS @REALDONALDTRUMP AFTER CAPITOL RIOT
The spokesperson told Fox News that Twitter, as they did in 2017 during President Trump’s inauguration, is working to &#34;support the archival and transition of Twitter accounts across administrations.&#34;
The spokesperson said Twitter will transfer current accounts to the National Archives and Records Administration, where the tweets and account history &#34;will remain publicly available and the account usernames will be updated to reflect their archived status.&#34;
President Trump’s official administration account, @POTUS, will be public archived as @POTUS45, just as former President Obama’s account was archived as @POTUS44, Twitter said.
Earlier this month, following the Capitol riot, Twitter moved to permanently suspend President Trump from his @realDonaldTrump account.
&#34;After a close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them – specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter – we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence,&#34; Twitter said.
Later, when the president shared three messages from the official @POTUS handle, Twitter quickly took them down. He sent the same text out in a statement to White House reporters, criticizing Twitter as an opponent of free speech and teasing a potential new conservative social media platform in the future.
The official account had, until that point, not shared any tweets since late December. It will be transferred to President-elect Joe Biden after Inauguration Day and remains active.
Twitter also noted that with the swearing-in of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will come the @FLOTUS account for incoming first lady Jill Biden, and a new handle &#34;@SecondGentleman&#34; for Harris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff.
BIDEN TO DELIVER FORWARD-LOOKING INAUGURAL ADDRESS FOCUSED ON UNITY
Meanwhile, Twitter pointed to &#34;multiple challenging circumstances&#34; surrounding Biden’s inauguration – like the novel coronavirus pandemic and the aftermath of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot – and said their platform &#34;will serve as both a venue for people to watch and talk about this political event.&#34;
Twitter also noted that following the Capitol riot, the platform is taking additional steps to &#34;protect the public conversation&#34; from attempts to &#34;incite violence, organize attacks and share deliberately misleading information about the election outcome.&#34;
&#34;These efforts, including our open lines of communication with law enforcement, will continue through the inauguration and will adapt as needed if circumstances change in real-time,&#34; Twitter said.

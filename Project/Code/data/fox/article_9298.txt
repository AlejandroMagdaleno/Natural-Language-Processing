Former President Donald Trump discusses the crisis at the border.
Former President Trump
 ripped 
President Joe Biden
 and his administration over the migrant surge at the 
U.S. border
 during an exclusive interview on &#34;
The Faulkner Focus
&#34; on Monday, arguing that the Biden administration is &#34;destroying our country.&#34;
He also said that Democrats are bringing violence from other countries into the U.S. 
&#34;You have a lot of bad people coming into our country and they&#39;re [the Biden administration] is doing nothing about it,&#34; Trump said, noting that murderers and sex traffickers are among those currently entering the U.S. 
&#34;It&#39;s crazy,&#34; Trump added. 
The former president said he is speaking out about the situation at the border because he wants &#34;to do what’s right.&#34;

Secretary of Homeland Security 
Alejandro Mayorkas
 has claimed that the number of people looking to enter the U.S. at the southern border could be the highest in 20 years, but in an interview with &#34;
Fox News Sunday
&#34; he claimed that this is because of the Trump administration&#39;s actions, not policy changes that took place in the early days of President Biden’s administration.
Biden has scrapped a number of Trump&#39;s policies which included having asylum seekers remain in Mexico instead of staying in the U.S. while they wait for their cases to be heard. Mayorkas denied that Biden&#39;s changes have encouraged the current migrant surge.
&#34;What we are seeing is the result of President Trump&#39;s dismantlement of the safe and orderly immigration processes that were built over many, many years by presidents of both parties,&#34; Mayorkas said. &#34;That&#39;s what we are seeing, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s taking time for us to execute our plans to administer the humanitarian claims of vulnerable children. That&#39;s what this is about.&#34;
Addressing the elimination of the remain in Mexico policy, Mayorkas said the Biden administration has replaced this &#34;with a safe and orderly triage system working with our partners in Mexico and humanitarian organizations in the international space and we are not expelling vulnerable children.&#34; 
The secretary also defended Biden&#39;s elimination of Trump&#39;s &#34;safe third country&#34; agreements, which required migrants to seek asylum in another country first if they were passing through a safe country on their way to the U.S. He claimed that &#34;there&#39;s nothing safe about&#34; sending people back &#34;to the very countries from which they are fleeing persecution.&#34;
Mayorkas also asserted that the Biden administration has been sending a message discouraging children from trying to enter the U.S. right now &#34;because we are rebuilding orderly processes for them as well, as the country always had until the prior administration.&#34;

Despite that message, however, data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shows that the numbers of migrants have gone up tremendously since Biden took office and changed immigration policies.
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is encountering an average of 565 child migrants per day, up from 313 last month. In 2019, border agents encountered 76,020 unaccompanied children for an average of just over 208 per day. While families and single adults can still be expelled under Tile 42, a Trump-era coronavirus health order, no children will be expelled from the U.S.
Over the weekend, Trump slammed Mayorkas and his &#34;pathetic&#34; and &#34;clueless performance&#34; on the Sunday news programs, calling it a &#34;national disgrace.&#34;
&#34;We proudly handed the Biden Administration the most secure border in history,&#34; Trump wrote in a statement on Sunday. &#34;All they had to do was keep this smooth-running system on autopilot.&#34;
&#34;Instead, in the span of a just few weeks, the Biden Administration has turned a national triumph into a national disaster. They are in way over their heads and taking on water fast.&#34;
Trump added that Mayorkas’ &#34;self-satisfied presentation—in the middle of the massive crisis he helped engineer—is yet more proof he is incapable of leading DHS.&#34;
&#34;Even someone of Mayorkas’ limited abilities should understand that if you provide Catch-and-Release to the world’s illegal aliens then the whole world will come,&#34; he continued.
&#34;Furthermore, the Mayorkas Gag Order on our Nation’s heroic border agents and ICE officers should be the subject of an immediate congressional investigation. But it’s clear they are engaged in a huge cover-up to hide just how bad things truly are.&#34;
&#34;The only way to end the Biden Border Crisis is for them to admit their total failure and adopt the profoundly effective, proven Trump policies,&#34; he concluded.
While the Biden administration has maintained a message that now is &#34;not the time&#34; to come to the U.S. border, the White House still insists the overwhelming surge is not a &#34;crisis.&#34;
On Monday, Trump also said he &#34;never thought Biden would be far worse&#34; than self-proclaimed socialist 
Sen. Bernie Sanders
, I-Vt., adding that the current president is &#34;Bernie Sanders on steroids.&#34;
He also warned that &#34;you haven’t seen anything yet.&#34;
&#34;You are going to see 
packing the courts
. You are going to see the 
biggest tax increase
 in history. You’re going to see the 
Second Amendment 
just absolutely obliterated. You’re going to see many other things. The 
Green New Deal
 will be put into effect,&#34; Trump said.
Trump noted that there is no transparency from the current administration regarding the situation at the border.
Some members of the 
media
, including from left-wing 
CNN
, have 
called out
 the Biden administration for denying them access to what many believe to be a crisis of the administration’s own doing.
Trump said he thinks the situation at the border is &#34;only going to get worse.&#34;

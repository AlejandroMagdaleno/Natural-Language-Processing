On today’s episode of ‘Special Report’, Bret anticipates President Biden&#39;s joint address to congress following proposed $6 trillion spending spree; plus, preview of Sen. Tim Scott&#39;s Republican response to Biden. 
President Biden’s first address to a joint session of comments spanned 67 minutes, a host of costly topics and a gulf of partisan reaction.
And for the discerning eye, the lofty rhetoric loaded into Biden’s teleprompter laid bare the night’s winners and losers... 
Former President Donald J. Trump:
 
Biden hailed the COVID-19 vaccines distributed across the U.S. as a &#34;dose of hope.&#34; That hope was launched on Trump’s watch under his Operation Warp Speed program.
China’s Xi Jinping:
 
Biden offered no direct condemnation on pollution or military aggression in the region. &#34;In my discussion with President Xi, I told him we welcome the competition – we&#39;re not looking for conflict,&#34; he said. 
BIDEN&#39;S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS: EVERYTHING TO KNOW
Members of Congress who watched from home: 
No masks, comfortable couch and no awkward fist bumps or elbow bumps necessary.
IRAN: 
No mention of staunch ally Israel. And not a peep about reports former Secretary of State John Kerry dished details of covert Israeli actions to the Iranians.
Messaging on wearing masks: 
Are they necessary even among the fully vaccinated or are they not? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris remained masked-up mere feet behind the maskless Biden throughout the speech.
Eloquent English:
 
Aside from some scrambled syntax and sentence structure that can trip up anyone talking non-stop for more than an hour, Biden also uncorked some headscratchers. Exhibit A: &#34;We have to do more than build back better. We have to build back better.&#34;

American taxpayers: 
Biden waxed about the societal virtues of raising taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans. But those hikes have a trickle down impact as employers and affluent entrepreneurs eye more welcoming shores -- and take American jobs overseas with them.
The border: 
The plight of migrants, or the strain their arrival has placed on U.S. resources, didn’t rank a line.

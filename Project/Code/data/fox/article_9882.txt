Florida congressman says New York Times story accusing him of sexual misconduct is false on &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39;
The federal investigation of Rep. 
Matt Gaetz
, R-Fla., involving possible sex trafficking could break wide open now that Gaetz’s associate 
Joel Greenberg
 appears ready to cut a deal in a case of his own.
But who is Greenberg? His case has been reported to have led to the Gaetz investigation, but now Greenberg’s attorney believes that the congressman is the one in real trouble as lawyers on both sides of Greenberg’s case confirmed that plea negotiations were underway.
GAETZ CONNECTION JOEL GREENBERG EXPECTED TO STRIKE PLEA DEAL
&#34;I am sure Matt Gaetz is not feeling very comfortable today,&#34; Greenberg’s attorney Fritz Scheller said, according to the 
Orlando Sentinel
.
Gaetz, thus far, has not faced any charges. Greenberg, however, faces 33 counts including stalking a political opponent, sex trafficking of a minor and conspiracy to bribe a public official. 
Greenberg served as tax collector in Seminole County, Florida, from 2016 until his resignation last June. He stepped down from the elected office one day after prosecutors revealed that he had been indicted on multiple charges. He is a known political ally of Gaetz, who once posted a photo of himself and Greenberg at the White House.

A new report in 
The New York Times
 describes a wide array of allegations leveled against Greenberg over the years. These include asking a contractor to hack into county computers, embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from Seminole County, pulling over a female driver while wearing a tax collector badge, and engaging in &#34;sugar daddy&#34; relationships with young women for whom he would make fake IDs out of driver’s licenses that had been surrendered to his office.

&#34;It’s like the Tiger King got elected tax collector,&#34; said attorney Daniel A. Pérez, who once represented someone who had worked for Greenberg.
The 
Washington Post
 reported Gaetz had &#34;repeatedly&#34; bragged about women he met through Greenberg and shared photos of naked women at parties where the former tax collector was in attendance.

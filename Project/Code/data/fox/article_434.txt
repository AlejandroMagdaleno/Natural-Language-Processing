Arizona’s 
Gov. Doug Ducey accused the 
Biden 
administration of &#34;federal overreach&#34; this week after the Treasury Department said the state&#39;s educational grants specifically allocated for schools without mask mandates were an improper use of federal 
coronavirus
 relief money. 
&#34;We have no plan to address what they&#39;re sending us,&#34; Ducey, a Republican, said this week, according to FOX 10 in Phoenix. &#34;That will be settled in court. We&#39;re going to give options to kids in Arizona and to families in Arizona - what we should be focused on now is getting kids caught up.&#34;
A $10 million grant program established by Ducey in August reportedly gives families $7,000 vouchers if they want to move their children from a school with a mandate to a school without one. 
Another $163 million grant program Ducey created is available only to schools without mask mandates, according to the station.

FOX 10
 reported. 
&#34;Here in Arizona, we trust families to make decisions that are best for their children,&#34; Ducey tweeted on Tuesday. &#34;It’s clear that President Biden doesn’t feel the same. He’s focused on taking power away from American families by issuing restrictive and dictatorial mandates for his own political gain.&#34; 
Arizona is among several Republican-led states that have banned mask mandates in schools.

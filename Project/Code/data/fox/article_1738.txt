President Biden has decided not to extend an Aug. 31 deadline to remove all American troops from 
Afghanistan
, a U.S. official tells Fox News. 
The development comes shortly after a Taliban spokesperson – following a meeting between leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and CIA Director William Burns in Kabul – said there will be &#34;no extensions&#34; to the Biden administration’s Aug. 31 date.  
Defense Dept. Press Secretary John Kirby said Tuesday that the White House is still &#34;aiming toward the end of the month&#34; for a complete withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.

U.S. TROOPS WILL HAVE TO BEGIN AFGHANISTAN PULLOUT ON FRIDAY TO MEET DEADLINE
&#34;We continue to make progress every day in getting Americans – as well as Special Immigrant Visa applicants and vulnerable Afghans – out,&#34; he said. &#34;We remain committed to getting any and all Americans that want to leave, to get them out. We still believe – certainly now that we have been able to increase the capacity and the flow – we believe that we have the ability to get that done by the end of the month.&#34; 
The Pentagon also said the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan will go to &#34;zero&#34; at the Aug. 31 deadline. 
In addition to the 6,000 U.S. troops at Kabul&#39;s airport, there are dozens of armored vehicles and U.S. Army Apache gunships.
Earlier, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said his group will accept &#34;no extensions&#34; of the Aug. 31 deadline, the Associated Press reports.

Mujahid also claimed he is &#34;not aware&#34; of any meeting between Burns and Baradar, but did not deny that such a meeting took place, the AP added.

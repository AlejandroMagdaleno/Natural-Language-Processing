&#34;I have COVID, Becca has COVID, my son has COVID. Becca and I had COVID before, early on, in January 2020, before the world really knew what it was,&#34; Higgins 
posted
 on Facebook, adding that &#34;this episode is far more challenging&#34; than the first and that &#34;[i]t has required all of my devoted energy.&#34;
Higgins went on to say that he and his family &#34;are under excellent care and our prognosis is positive.&#34; He noted that their treatment &#34;encompasses western, eastern, and holistic variables,&#34; which is how they deal with all health issues.

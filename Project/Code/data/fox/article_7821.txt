&#39;Outnumbered&#39; panel reacts to tweets from &#39;Squad&#39; members on the escalating conflict in the Middle East.
EXCLUSIVE
: Rep. 
Carlos Gimenez
, R-Fla., is leading an effort in the 
House
 to call out Hamas as a terrorist group and to double down on support for the people of 
Israel
 as deadly fighting intensifies in the Middle East.
&#34;Israel has every right to defend itself and defend its citizens,&#34; Gimenez told Fox News Thursday. &#34;I don&#39;t know of an instance where there&#39;s outright aggression from the state of Israel that was done without provocation.&#34;
AOC CRITICIZES BIDEN STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL AS SIDING WITH &#39;OCCUPATION&#39;
Gimenez is introducing a resolution Thursday with the support of at least 50 Republicans to condemn &#34;the acts of terrorism committed by Hamas&#34; and to support Israel&#39;s right to defend itself from attacks. He shared 
the resolution
 first with Fox News. 
His effort comes as members of the so-called progressive Squad been very critical of Israel. Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y., hit President Biden over his Wednesday statement in support of Israel and accused him of taking &#34;
the side of the occupation
.&#34; And Rep. 
Ilhan Omar
, D-Minn., accused Israel of committing an &#34;
act of terrorism
&#34; by launching airstrikes into Gaza.
ILHAN OMAR FUNDRAISES OFF BACKLASH TO ANTI-ISRAEL COMMENTS
&#34;Members of the Squad, I believe, are out of touch with America,&#34; Gimenez told Fox News. &#34;They think that they speak for America and they don&#39;t.&#34;
&#34;I&#39;m trying to make sure that Congress stands up,&#34; the freshman Republican added. &#34;You need to be counted. Who do you stand with? Do you stand with the terrorists of Hamas, or do you stand with the state of Israel? That&#39;s another reason why we want to put this resolution forward.&#34;

Fighting between Israel and Gaza&#39;s militant Hama rulers intensified Thursday. Hamas sent a heavy barrage of rockets deep into Israel, as Israel pounded Gaza with more airstrikes and shells and called up 9,000 more reservists who could be used to stage a ground invasion.
REP. ILHAN OMAR ACCUSES ISRAEL OF &#39;TERRORISM&#39; AMID CLASH WITH HAMAS
Gimenez said he supports Biden&#39;s statements backing Israel and doesn&#39;t think the Biden administration needs to do more at this point to assist. Biden said Wednesday Israel has a right to defend itself &#34;when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory.&#34;
&#34;The verbal affirmation of their right to self-defense is a step in the right direction,&#34; Gimenez said. &#34;I don&#39;t think they need to go further at this point unless the situation gets even [worse].&#34;
So far, no Democrats have signed on to his resolution, but Gimenez hopes that will change.

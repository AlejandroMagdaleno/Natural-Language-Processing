Chad Pergram reports on House vote on stimulus package
The U.S. 
House of Representatives
 approved a massive $1.9 trillion 
coronavirus
 stimulus package early Saturday -- the sixth COVID bill passed since the pandemic began a year ago.
The vote around 2 a.m. ET was 219-212.
Two Democrats voted against their party&#39;s plan: U.S. Reps. Jared Golden of Maine and Kurt Schrader of Oregon. Both lawmakers also opposed a $3 trillion bill last May that ultimately failed.
Golden issued a statement defending his decision.
&#34;During challenging times, the country needs its elected leaders to work together to meet the most urgent needs in their communities,&#34; Golden said, according to The Associated Press. &#34;This bill addresses urgent needs, and then buries them under a mountain of unnecessary or untimely spending.&#34;

Not a single Republican backed Saturday&#39;s bill. About two hours before the vote, House Minority Leader 
Kevin McCarthy
 derided the proposal as &#34;Pelosi’s Payoff Bill.&#34;
McCarthy, R-Calif., further described the legislation as &#34;Democrats’ costly, corrupt and liberal spending package,&#34; one that he claimed signified, &#34;The Swamp is back.&#34;
HOUSE TO VOTE ON BIDEN&#39;S $1.9T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES $1,400 STIMULUS CHECKS
&#34;Congress won’t actually vote on this bill until 2 a.m. Saturday,&#34; McCarthy said. &#34;Why? Because Democrats are so embarrassed by all the non-COVID waste in this bill that they are jamming it through in the dead of night.

&#34;We ran the numbers,&#34; McCarthy added. &#34;The amount of money that actually goes to defeating the virus is less than 9 percent – Less than 9 percent! So don’t call it a rescue bill. Don’t call it a relief bill. Call it the Pelosi Payoff.&#34;

Many Republicans particularly objected to Democrats’ efforts to include a $15 minimum wage requirement as part of the package -- saying it would hurt businesses and cost many Americans their jobs. 
The House bill passed Saturday morning included the $15 plan -- but the Democrats&#39; effort was expected to run into a roadblock in the Senate because Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough this week decided that inclusion of the $15 plan would violate Senate rules.
Shortly before midnight Friday, House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 defended the bill in remarks on the House floor, declaring the $15 minimum wage goal would be achieved one way or another, regardless of MacDonough’s ruling.
&#34;It is inevitable to all of us, the $15 minimum wage will be achieved,&#34; Pelosi said, &#34;even if it is inconceivable to some, it is inevitable to us – and we will work diligently to shorten the distance between the inevitable and the inconceivable.&#34;
The $15 minimum wage proposal is particularly important to progressives -- but other House Democrats appeared pleased with the bill that was passed Saturday.
&#34;I am a happy camper tonight,&#34; U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said, according to The Associated Press. &#34;This is what America needs. Republicans, you ought to be a part of this. But if you&#39;re not, we&#39;re going without you.&#34;

Lawmakers were rushing to send approved legislation to President Biden&#39;s desk by March 14, when key unemployment aid programs for millions are set to expire.
The proposal contains a third $1,400 stimulus check for Americans earning less than $75,000 annually, increases jobless benefits to $400 a week through the end of August, expands the child tax credit to up to $3,600 per child, includes $350 billion for state and local government funding and allocates $170 billion for K-12 schools and higher education institutions to cover reopening costs.
GOP lawmakers have questioned the need for another $2 trillion, accusing their liberal colleagues of using the bill as means of passing a &#34;Democratic wish list.&#34;

Following the House vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., accused House Democrats of bringing the &#34;wrong attitude&#34; to the coronavirus legislation.
&#34;In 2020, Congress passed five COVID-19 rescue passages,&#34; McConnell said in a statement. &#34;All five were completely bipartisan. It was the largest peacetime fiscal expansion in American history ... because both parties had shaped the bills together and they met Americans&#39; urgent needs.&#34;
&#34;Tonight,&#34; he added, &#34;House Democrats snapped that bipartisan streak. They jammed through a bill that even liberal economsts and editorial boards say is not targeted to this stage of the fight.&#34;

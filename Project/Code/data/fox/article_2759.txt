Report says New York Governor Andrew Cuomo rationed coronavirus testing kits requested by long-term care facilities at peak of pandemic while securing access for his family, friends. Bryan Llenas reports from Brooklyn.
A ninth woman has stepped forward to accuse 
New York
 Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 of sexual misconduct. 
The accuser, 55-year-old Sherry Vill, said Cuomo grabbed her face and kissed her cheeks in front of her home in 2017.
NYC ACTIVISTS TURN UP THE PRESSURE FOR CUOMO&#39;S OUSTER
&#34;I know the difference between an innocent gesture and a sexual one,&#34; Vill said during a virtual press conference. &#34;I never felt as uncomfortable as I did the day Governor Cuomo came to my house. His actions were very overly sexual, highly inappropriate and disrespectful to me and my family.&#34;
Vill said Cuomo told her she was beautiful and acted in a &#34;highly flirtatious and inappropriate manner.&#34;
Vill was married at the time of the alleged incident, her attorney Gloria Allred said. Cuomo visited Vill&#39;s home in Greece, N.Y., to survey flood damage.

      Attorney Gloria Allred showed these photos during a virtual press conference with Cuomo accuser Sherry Vill on Monday, March 29, 2021.
      
&#34;For years she wanted to report what Governor Cuomo did to her, but some members of her family discouraged her from filing a complaint, because they wanted to protect her and feared that if she made what happened to her public that the Governor might use his power to retaliate against her and her family,&#34; Allred said.
&#34;After our press conference today, we plan to contact the New York Attorney General’s office in order to inform them that Sherry is willing to cooperate in the investigation that is currently being conducted into numerous allegations of sexual harassment by the Governor,&#34; she continued.
Allred also showed what appeared to be an image of Cuomo smooching Vill captured that day in 2017.
Cuomo&#39;s attorney, Rita Glavin, pushed back on the allegation that the governor behaved inappropriately during the visit, arguing that he often greets people with hugs and kisses as a gesture of &#34;comfort.&#34; She 
shared a link
 to photos that showed the governor interacting with other local residents on the day of the alleged incident.
&#34;During times of crisis, the Governor has frequently sought to comfort New Yorkers with hugs and kisses,&#34; Glavin said in a statement. &#34;As I have said before, the Governor has greeted both men and women with hugs, a kiss on the cheek, forehead or hand for the past forty years.&#34;
Vill said she later received a signed letter from Cuomo, as well as photos of their meeting at her home. In response, Glavin said more than 30 people received a &#34;nearly identical follow-up form letter.&#34; She added that its common for the governor&#39;s office to follow up after an event with photos or other communication.
Cuomo faces a growing number of sexual harassment allegations starting with former aide Lindsey Boylan, who alleged that the governor attempted to kiss her in his office, which he has denied.

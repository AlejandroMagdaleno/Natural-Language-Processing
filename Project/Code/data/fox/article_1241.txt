Rep. Matt Gaetz R-FL., joins &#39;Fox Report&#39; to discuss the possibility of a statewide travel ban, influx of New Yorkers leaving the northeast for the Sunshine State.

Gov. Ron DeSantis
 called 
President Biden&#39;s
 reported consideration of domestic travel bans during the 
coronavirus
 pandemic amid signing 
immigration executive orders
 &#34;a huge contradiction.&#34;
&#34;This stinks to high heaven,&#34; the Republican governor told &#34;
Sunday Morning Futures
&#34; during an exclusive interview.
&#34;It is a huge contradiction and you can&#39;t square wanting opening borders for illegal aliens, but then also restricting U.S. citizens from basically traveling around the country as they see fit and I think the American people see the hypocrisy in that,&#34; he continued. 
Earlier this month, President Biden 
signed three executive orders on immigration
, including one to create a task force to reunify migrants separated under the Trump administration – part of a sweeping push by Biden to roll back his predecessor’s 
immigration
 policies.
&#34;So he&#39;s [Biden’s] opening the border [and] he’s letting illegals pour in,&#34; DeSantis continued. &#34;They’re not doing any COVID tests. They’re [migrants are] just coming into the communities.&#34;

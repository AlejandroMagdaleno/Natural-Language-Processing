Randy Economy, senior adviser for Recall Gavin Newsom, calls for a debate with the California governor on the issues.
Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein
, D-Calif., on Tuesday brushed off comments 
California 
Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
 made a day earlier, saying he had several replacements in mind if the 87-year-old senator were to retire, according to reports. 
&#34;Please, we’re very good friends,&#34; Feinstein told querying reporters after confirming she has no plans to resign, Politico reported. &#34;I don’t think he meant that the way some people thought.&#34;
The governor, a Democrat, sparked the questions Monday when he confirmed to 
MSNBC’s Joy Reid
 he had &#34;multiple&#34; names in mind when she asked if he would replace Feinstein with a Black woman if she didn&#39;t finish her term.
His answer prompted questions of whether Feinstein was actually planning to retire and criticisms Newsom was offering the promise of a woman of color for her replacement as a distraction from the mounting recall effort against him.

The petition to recall the governor over his handling of 
coronavirus 
lockdowns has gotten more than 2 million signatures, meaning it will likely be on the ballot.

Sacramento Bee
 wrote of Newsom’s comments about Feinstein.

Feinstein told reporters they were making a &#34;mountain out of a molehill&#34; about Newsom’s remarks. &#34;I don’t know about his plans, but his relationship with me, I think, is good and strong,&#34; she said, according to 
Politico
. 
The senator added that she feels &#34;absolutely&#34; fit to serve. &#34;I think that’s pretty obvious.&#34; She has four years left in her current term. 
Feinstein has faced questions and criticisms about her mental acuity over the last several months following reports alleging forgetfulness and frustrations over her handling of conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court last fall.
Newsom clarified his comments Tuesday, saying he was speaking to &#34;a hypothetical.&#34;

&#34;I hope she serves out her entire term,&#34; he said. &#34;I was asked a direct question, I tend to answer direct questions.&#34; He said in the future he will try to avoid hypotheticals.

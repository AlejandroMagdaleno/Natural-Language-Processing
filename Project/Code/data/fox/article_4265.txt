President Biden
 will court GOP senators next week at the White House in an effort to strike a deal on his spending bill, but 
Republicans
 stressed they don&#39;t want tax increases on businesses or any liberal &#34;wish list&#34; items as part of any compromise. 
The White House proposed a $2.25 trillion phase one infrastructure and tax plan plus an additional $1.8 trillion spending plan on family infrastructure, such as free community college, universal preschool and a paid family and medical leave program.
GOP BLAMES BIDEN FOR &#39;HORRENDOUS&#39; APRIL JOBS REPORT
Biden on Thursday will meet with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., who is leading the GOP counteroffer of $568 billion in traditional infrastructure investments. 
She&#39;ll be joined by five of her GOP colleagues who serve on relevant committees: Sens. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; Roy Blunt, R-Mo.; Mike Crapo, R-Idaho; Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Roger Wicker, R-Miss.
&#34;There is potential to come together with the Democrats on a deal if we leave out unrelated provisions like the Green New Deal and so-called climate justice,&#34; Barrasso told Fox News Saturday. &#34;Thursday’s meeting is an opportunity for President Biden to leave his liberal wish list behind and show he’s serious about working together on a bipartisan solution.&#34;
WHAT&#39;S IN BIDEN&#39;S $2.25T INFRASTRUCTURE AND TAX PROPOSAL?
Biden proposes paying for the first package by raising $2 trillion in taxes over 15 years on corporations. The plan includes hiking the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, eliminating tax breaks for oil and gas companies and increasing the global minimum tax on U.S. corporations to 21% from 13%. 
The federal government ran an annual deficit of $3.1 trillion in the 2020 fiscal year, more than triple the deficit of the previous year, according to the 
Bipartisan Policy Center
. The cumulative national debt now sits at $28 trillion.
Republicans say now is not the time to be increasing taxes on businesses as the economy is still trying to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. 

      Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., will be meeting President Biden at the White House on May 13, 2021, to discuss infrastructure spending. 
      
&#34;Senate Republicans have a targeted and responsible infrastructure plan,&#34; Wicker told Fox News on Saturday. &#34;If the President will work with us, infrastructure is something we can and should be able to do in a bipartisan way. What there isn&#39;t any appetite for in our conference is a tax increase on job creators.&#34;
The GOP senators say their nearly $600 billion counteroffer is focused on funding for traditional infrastructure such as roads, bridges, public transit and railways, whereas the Biden administration has taken a much more expansive view of infrastructure with funding for affordable housing, home healthcare services, electric vehicles and more.
If Biden narrows the scope to so-called &#34;core&#34; infrastructure, Republicans say there could be a deal. 
&#34;Where the common ground is, is actual infrastructure,&#34; Toomey said in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, according to 
TribLIVE.com
.  &#34;It’s roads and bridges and highways and airports and all of the things that we understand are infrastructure, and there is bipartisan support for that. That’s the opportunity for the administration.&#34;
WHAT&#39;S IN BIDEN&#39;S NEWEST $1.8T TAX AND SPENDING PLAN?
For his part, Biden has been welcoming the conversation and said he&#39;s open to finding a bipartisan path forward with the senators. 
A White House official said Friday Biden &#34;appreciates their engagement and the ongoing dialogue on this high priority, and is looking forward to speaking with the group.&#34;
The meeting with GOP senators Thursday will come a day after Biden is scheduled to meet with the top congressional leaders in the White House for the first time.

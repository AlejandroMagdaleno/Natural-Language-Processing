Sean Hannity explores the hypocrisy of Democrats&#39; case against the former president.
Sen. 
Lindsey Graham
, R-S.C., defended Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney on Tuesday following criticism of her decision to vote in favor of former President 
Donald Trump’s impeachment
, saying that her experience and leadership are &#34;invaluable to the Republican Party.&#34;
&#34;I believe 
@RepLizCheney
 is one of the strongest and most reliable conservative voices in the Republican Party. She is a fiscal and social conservative, and no one works harder to ensure that our military is well prepared,&#34; Graham tweeted on Tuesday.
The comments come after Senate Minority Leader 
Mitch McConnell
 defended Cheney on Monday. 
Cheney has faced calls to resign from her post as House GOP conference chair since she and nine other Republicans crossed party lines to impeach Trump.

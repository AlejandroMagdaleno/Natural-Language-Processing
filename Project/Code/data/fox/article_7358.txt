Jobs Creator Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz discusses the impact of the MLB pulling the All-Star game out of Georgia. 
White House
 press secretary Jen Psaki seemed to shy away Monday from 
President Biden&#39;s
 previous comments about Major League Baseball pulling its All-Star game from 
Georgia
.
Last week, before the MLB said it would exit in response to the state&#39;s voting law, Biden said he would &#34;strongly support&#34; baseball players pushing to move the game.
&#34;I think today&#39;s professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them doing that,&#34; Biden told ESPN last week. &#34;People look to them. They&#39;re leaders. The very people who are victimized the most are the leaders in these various sports.&#34;
BIDEN SAYS HE&#39;D &#39;STRONGLY SUPPORT&#39; MLB MOVING ALL-STAR GAME OUT OF ATLANTA OVER GEORGIA ELECTION LAW
ESPN&#39;s Sage Steele had referenced Tony Clark, executive director of the MLB Players Association, saying he would look forward to moving the All-Star game out of Atlanta because of the law. &#34;So, Mr. President, what do you think about the possibility that baseball decides to move their All-Star game out of Atlanta because of this political issue?&#34;
During Monday&#39;s press briefing, Psaki repeated Biden&#39;s words but framed it as him supporting the ability of the league to make its own decision. &#34;Well, he supports them being able to make the decision and respond to what their players&#39; asks are given many of them are impacted of course by these laws,&#34; she said.
She later told Fox News&#39; Peter Doocy that the context of ESPN&#39;s question was &#34;around the league meeting to discuss this exact issue.&#34;

Doocy followed by asking whether Biden would support moving the Masters Tournament out of Georgia if the Professional Golf Association (PGA) players rallied behind doing so.
&#34;I&#39;m sure you will ask me that question or him this question,&#34; Psaki responded, &#34;but our focus is on doing what we can to advocate for making voting easier and more accessible around the country, and that&#39;s where our efforts are going to be from the White House.&#34;

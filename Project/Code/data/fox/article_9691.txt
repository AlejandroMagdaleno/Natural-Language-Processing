South Dakota governor joins &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39; to explain the NCAA&#39;s role in her decision
The 
West Virginia
 House of Delegates has approved legislation that would require 
student athletes
 to present a birth certificate or signed physician&#39;s statement verifying their sex matches the one of the single-sex sports league they&#39;re seeking to enter.
The legislation was sent on Thursday to the state Senate, where Republicans control the chamber. In the House, it overwhelmingly 
passed
 along a 78-20 vote.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has 
already vowed
 to sue over the bill if it becomes law. On its website, it describes the bill as &#34;discrimination against transgender students.&#34;
The legislation comes amid a nationwide struggle over the future of women&#39;s sports and whether individuals who identify as &#34;transgender&#34; can compete on single-sex teams. Legislation on the issue has nearly doubled this year with 42 bills introduced in 26 states. Republicans say it is a robust response to President Biden&#39;s 
executive order
 aimed at preventing discrimination on the basis of gender identity, allowing students to compete against those of the sex they identify as.

That order argued that &#34;[c]hildren should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room or school sports.&#34;

Mississippi passed legislation this month maintaining that &#34;[a]thletic teams or sports designated for &#39;females,&#39; &#39;women&#39; or &#39;girls&#39; shall not be open to students of the male sex.&#34;

South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has come under fire for opposing a similar law passed by her state&#39;s legislature, which sought to require verification for a student&#39;s age and &#34;biological sex, as ascertained at or before birth in accordance with the student&#39;s genetics and reproductive biology.&#34; It also included a requirement to verify that &#34;the student is not taking and has not taken, during the preceding 12 months, any performance enhancing drugs, including anabolic steroids.&#34;
Noem returned the bill, saying its &#34;vague and overly broad language could have significant unintended consequences.&#34;

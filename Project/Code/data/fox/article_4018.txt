FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo reacts to the former president&#39;s comments on the latest edition of &#39;Seen and Unseen&#39;
Former 
President George W. Bush 
said in an interview he did not vote for either candidate in the 2020 presidential election and instead wrote in 
Condoleezza Rice
, who served as his secretary of state.
&#34;She knows it,&#34; he told 
People. 
&#34;But she told me she would refuse to accept the office.&#34;
The relationship between the Bush family and former President Trump has never been close. Trump defeated his brother, Jeb Bush, in the tense Republican primary in 2016.
Bush, who has a new book, &#34;Out of Many, One: Portraits of America’s Immigrants,&#34; said in an interview with NBC’s &#34;Today&#34; show on Tuesday that the Republican Party he served as president has become &#34;isolationist, protectionist and, to a certain extent, nativist&#34; and says he’s especially concerned about anti-immigration rhetoric
&#34;It’s a beautiful country we have and yet it’s not beautiful when we condemn, call people names and scare people about immigration,&#34; he said.
Rice has been mentioned as a viable Republican candidate for president due to her experience in government. She served as secretary of state under Bush from 2005 to 2009 and previously served as a national security adviser.
Politico 
reported
 in 2016—when Trump’s run for office was gaining steam—that Rice expressed little interest in running as his vice president pick, or politics in general.
&#34;Dr. Rice has repeatedly said in past cycles as well as this one, she’s not interested in being vice president. She’s happy at Stanford and plans to stay.&#34;

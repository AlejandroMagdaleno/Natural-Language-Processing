Former White House Director of Strategic Communications Mercedes Schlapp joins &#39;Fox News @ Night&#39;
WASHINGTON (AP) – 
President Donald Trump
, in one of his final acts of office, released current and former members of his administration from the terms of their ethics pledge, which included a five-year ban on 
lobbying
 their former agencies.
The ethics pledge was outlined in one of Trump&#39;s first executive orders, signed on Jan. 28, 2017, as part of his campaign pledge to &#34;drain the swamp.&#34; It required Trump&#39;s political appointees to agree to the lobbying ban, as well as pledge not to undertake work that would require them to register as a &#34;foreign agent&#34; after leaving government. Trump&#39;s order authorized the attorney general to investigate any breaches of the ethics pledge and to pursue civil suits if necessary.
Trump signed the one-page revocation of the order on Tuesday, and it was released by the White House shortly after 1 a.m. Wednesday, hours before his term ends.
The new order states: &#34;Employees and former employees subject to the commitments in Executive Order 13770 will not be subject to those commitments after noon January 20, 2021.&#34;

Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary, says he&#39;s &#39;never seen anything like&#39; President Biden reading answers &#39;verbatim&#39; from cards during his first solo press conference.
Texas Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson, a former White House physician, believes that President Biden&#39;s press conference performance raises questions about his fitness for office.

press conference
 Thursday — which came 64 days after he took office — &#34;should concern every American who wants to know that their President is fit for duty and in control.&#34; 
&#34;The President of the United States was armed with a picture book of friendly reporters to call on and with what appeared to be prepared answers, but he still could barely make it through his first press conference,&#34; said Jackson.

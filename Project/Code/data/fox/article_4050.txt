Fox News contributor Joe Concha says MLB and companies boycotting Georgia are ‘way off base.’
Rep. 
Dan Crenshaw
, R-Texas, told 
United Airlines
 to just &#34;shut up&#34; after the airline followed the same, controversial route taken by their competitor Delta Airlines in attacking Georgia&#39;s new election law.
United Airlines called Georgia&#39;s 
new voting law
 &#34;wrong&#34; and claimed it &#34;infringes on the right to vote of fellow Americans.&#34;
COMPANIES RIPPING GEORGIA DO BUSINESS IN CHINA, SILENT ON HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS
The Texas congressman fired back on Monday, blasting United Airlines as pandering &#34;hypocrites.&#34;
Crenshaw pointed to United’s own policy requiring photo identification for people to board their flights.
&#34;&#39;Travelers 18 years of age or older are required to have a valid, current U.S. federal or state-issued photo ID that contains name, date of birth, gender, expiration date and a tamper-resistant feature for travel,&#39;&#34; wrote the congressman, quoting United&#39;s policy.
‘THE VIEW’ DERAILS INTO AWKWARD SILENCE AS MCCAIN CLASHES WITH WHOOPI OVER GEORGIA VOTING LAW

revealed 
that Delta had previously praised the new voting law, bringing receipts in the form of a previous statement.
&#34;Over the past several weeks, Delta engaged extensively with state elected officials in both parties to express our strong view that Georgia must have a fair and secure election process, with broad voter participation and equal access to the polls,&#34; the release reads.

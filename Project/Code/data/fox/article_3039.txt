Washington, D.C.&#39;s
 mayor turned a few heads with her Independence Day tweet.
As the nation was celebrating its 245th birthday, Mayor Muriel Bowser celebrated in a unique way, tweeting out a pornographic anime meme featuring well-known fast-food mascots.
The image features Ronald McDonald and Colonel Sanders of McDonald’s and KFC fame, respectively, holding up the breasts of fellow fast-food mascot Wendy from Wendy&#39;s, who is scantily clad and baring vampire fangs.

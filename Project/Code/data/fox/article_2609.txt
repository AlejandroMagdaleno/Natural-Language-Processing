The 
U.S. Senate
 on Tuesday voted to pass 
Sen. Tom Cotton
’s amendment in the budget reconciliation package that prohibits federal funds to be used to promote critical race theory in schools.
Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who has been critical of CRT, posted that the Senate approved the amendment in a 50-49 vote.

Cotton, R-Ark., posted a video of himself addressing the chamber. He said that he was raised to believe that the U.S. is a great nation. He called CRT an &#34;un-American ideology.&#34;
&#34;They want to teach our children that America is not a good nation, but a racist nation,&#34; he said. &#34;Those teachings are wrong and our tax dollars should not support them.&#34;
Cotton introduced the Stop CRT Act in July 2021 in an effort to prevent the funding to be used inside K-12 classes to teach the theory.

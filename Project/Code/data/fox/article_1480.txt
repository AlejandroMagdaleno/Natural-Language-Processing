President Biden 
said on Tuesday that he and 
Xi Jinping
 have agreed to abide by the Taiwan agreement as

takes a more aggressive stance against the democratically-run island, according to reports.

Biden was seemingly referring to the U.S.’ longstanding &#34;one China&#34; policy, meaning the White House doesn’t officially recognize Taiwan’s sovereignty and the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which allows for non-diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Taiwan and obligates the U.S. to help the island maintain its self-defense against China.

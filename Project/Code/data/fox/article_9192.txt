Former President Trump&#39;s attorney David Schoen plays clips on Feb. 12, 2021, of just about every Democratic lawmaker using similar language that Trump said during his Jan. 6 speech before the Capitol riot.
Former 
President Trump
&#39;s legal team tried to put Democrats on trial Friday by repeatedly playing clips of their past hot rhetoric and accusing liberals of setting a new &#34;dangerous double standard&#34; when it comes to Trump.
Trump&#39;s attorneys said the former president&#39;s speech before the 
Jan. 6 Capitol riot
 where he told backers to &#34;fight like hell&#34; was in no way an incitement to violence and they called out each of the House 
impeachment
 managers and each Democratic senator for making similar statements.
&#34;Every single one of you, and every one of you,&#34; David Schoen, a Trump attorney, bellowed at Democrats in the chamber at the end of an 11-minute video featuring clips of each of them saying &#34;fight.&#34;  
&#34;That&#39;s okay. You didn&#39;t do anything wrong. It&#39;s a word people use, but please stop the hypocrisy.&#34;

      Lawyer David Schoen speaks during Trump impeachment trial on Friday, Feb. 12.
      
Friday was Trump&#39;s first chance to mount a defense to the &#34;incitement of insurrection&#34; impeachment charge based on his actions and inactions surrounding the Jan. 6 Capitol riot that killed five people, including a Capitol Police officer.
DAY 3 RECAP: DEMOCRATIC IMPEACHMENT PROSECUTORS USE RIOTERS&#39; WORDS AGAINST TRUMP AT TRIAL, RESTING THEIR CASE
Trump&#39;s legal team blasted the proceedings as an unconstitutional, &#34;sham impeachment&#34; motivated by Democrats&#39; &#34;hatred&#34; for the former president. They said Trump&#39;s political speech is protected by the First Amendment.
His lawyers said it&#39;s &#34;absurd&#34; to think Trump was trying to promote insurrection on Jan. 6 based on his rhetoric that day and long history of promoting &#34;law and order&#34; and denouncing mob violence throughout his many other political rallies.
DAY 2 RECAP: DEMOCRATIC IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS DEPLOY MORE RIOT FOOTAGE TO MAKE CASE AGAINST &#39;INCITER-IN-CHIEF&#39; TRUMP
&#34;No thinking person could seriously believe that the president&#39;s January 6 speech on the ellipse was in any way an incitement to violence or insurrection,&#34; said Michael van der Veen, a Trump attorney. &#34;The suggestion is patently absurd on its face. Nothing in the text could ever be construed as encouraging, condoning or enticing unlawful activity of any kind.&#34;
Van der Veen added: &#34;To claim that the president in any way wished, desired or encouraged lawless or violent behavior is a preposterous and monstrous lie.&#34;
The defense team then repeatedly played several prolonged video montages designed to embarrass Democrats and call out a &#34;double standard.&#34; Videos starred just about every prominent Democrat, including Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., encouraging liberals to harass Trump officials, and President Biden saying if he were in high school again he&#39;d go behind the gym and &#34;beat the hell out&#34; of Trump.
IMPEACHMENT DAY ONE RECAP: DEMS IN TRUMP TRIAL USE GRAPHIC VIDEO OF CAPITOL ATTACK
Schoen teed up one of the videos by telling the chamber: &#34;We need to show you some of their own words.&#34;
Video clips also featured charged speech from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Vice President Kamala Harris where she quipped on the &#34;Ellen&#34; talk show that if she were stuck in an elevator with Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions that one of us may not &#34;come out alive.&#34;
Trump&#39;s legal team argued that Democrats could be impeached under the new standard they are now trying to apply to Trump.
TRUMP&#39;S IMPEACHMENT TRIAL: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
&#34;Under the standards of the House impeachment article, each of these individuals should be retroactively censored, expelled punished or impeached for inciting violence by their supporters,&#34; van der Veen said. 
Democrats blasted the legal team&#39;s focus on them as a distraction from Trump&#39;s own conduct.
&#34;What they are plainly doing is trying to draw a false and dangerous equivalence to distract from Donald Trump inviting and then inciting the mob and then failing his oath of office to protect the Capitol,&#34; Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Capitol Hill reporters Friday.
After Trump&#39;s defense team concludes, senators will have an opportunity to ask questions of the lawyers on both sides.

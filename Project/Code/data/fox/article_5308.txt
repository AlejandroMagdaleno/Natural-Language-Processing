National Border Patrol Council president comments on the vice president&#39;s management of the immigration crisis.
The head of the Border Patrol union slammed 
Vice President Harris
 on Sunday morning for advocating for 
migrants
 and, in turn, &#34;advocating for 
lawlessness
&#34; that has extended into other parts of the country.
Just days after Harris concluded her trip to Latin America – her first foreign trip since taking office – she has faced persistent questions about her decision not to visit the U.S.-Mexico border. To date, neither President Biden nor Harris has visited the border. 
IMMIGRATION SURGE DRIVEN BY &#39;CRAZY BIDEN POLICIES&#39;: REP. JORDAN
Speaking to Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on &#34;
Sunday Morning Futures,
&#34; National Border Patrol Council president Brandon Judd said Harris &#34;can’t go to the border – if she goes to the border, she’s going to be expected to solve this problem.&#34;
&#34;This is a problem that she created. She even came out and said that she&#39;s an advocate for illegal aliens,&#34; Judd said. &#34;She&#39;s supposed to be an advocate for citizens of this country. Yet, she&#39;s coming out and she&#39;s saying that she&#39;s advocating for lawlessness.&#34;
Instead, while Harris was in Guatemala City, she told those thinking of making the journey to the U.S.: &#34;Do not come.&#34;
Judd said Harris’ alleged lax attitude toward lawlessness is &#34;the reason that we&#39;re seeing all of the problems that we&#39;re seeing in cities like Oregon, New York, Chicago.&#34;
VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS SAYS SHE IS AN &#39;ADVOCATE&#39; FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AMID MIXED MESSAGING
He added: &#34;All of this lawlessness is existing because she advocates for lawlessness.&#34;
Earlier this week, immigration officials said border agents made 180,034 apprehensions on the Mexican border in May. There were 178,854 a month earlier. 
Total encounters are near 20-year-highs, though they aren’t directly comparable because expulsions under pandemic-related powers that deny an opportunity to seek asylum carry no legal consequences, encouraging people to make repeated attempts.

Judd also told Bartiromo that the immigration crisis is &#34;a man-made disaster, and it&#39;s a disaster that was, that&#39;s been made by this current administration.&#34;

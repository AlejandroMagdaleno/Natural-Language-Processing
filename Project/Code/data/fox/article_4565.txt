&#39;The Madness of Crowds&#39; author Douglas Murray provides insight on ‘Fox and Friends.’
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton mocked Republican criticisms surrounding &#34;cancel culture&#34; in a tweet posted Thursday.
Clinton — who lost to former President Donald Trump in 2016 — attacked the GOP as the &#34;party of &#39;Freedom Fries&#39;&#34; for raising concerns about the rise in &#34;cancel culture&#34; across Amreica.
&#34;The party of &#39;Freedom Fries&#39; would like you to know that &#39;cancel culture&#39; is a very serious problem,&#34; wrote the former Democratic presidential candidate.
NEW YORK TIMES ACCUSED OF &#39;GLORIFYING&#39; CANCEL CULTURE, &#39;CELEBRATING TEENAGE REVENGE NARRATIVES&#39;
Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee hit back quickly, blasting the former secretary&#39;s dismissal of cancel culture concerns as &#34;about the most normal thing&#34; that’s happened in &#34;a while.&#34;
Ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee Jim Jordan 
wrote 
a letter to Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., calling on the chairman to hold a hearing on the &#34;dangerous trend&#34; of cancel culture.
&#34;From newsrooms to college campuses to social media giants, we have seen a dangerous trend toward silencing and censoring certain political speech,&#34; Jordan wrote in the letter. &#34;As the committee entrusted with upholding the Constitution and our fundamental liberties, our first full committee hearing for the 117th Congress must examine this cancel culture sweeping America.&#34;
Clinton’s mocking of Republican criticism of cancel culture comes in the wake of those on the left targeting 
conservatives
 and American icons like 
Dr. Seuss
 alike for their political views.

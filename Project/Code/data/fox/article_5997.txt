House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said that the Republican party is not the party of &#34;nativist dog whistles,&#34; in an apparent rebuke of the leaked platform of a new caucus reportedly being formed by several Republicans. 
&#34;America is built on the idea that we are all created equal and success is earned through honest, hard work. It isn’t built on identity, race, or religion,&#34; McCarthy wrote on Twitter. &#34;The Republican Party is the party of Lincoln &amp; the party of more opportunity for all Americans—not nativist dog whistles.&#34;
Plans of the &#34;America First&#34; caucus were first reported by Punchbowl News Friday.  The group is being led by Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Paul Gosar, R-Ariz. 
The seven-page policy outline obtained by 
Punchbowl 
said that members of  the caucus needed to possess a &#34;certain intellectual boldness&#34; to follow in President Trump’s footsteps and &#34;potentially step on some toes and sacrifice sacred cows for the good of the American nation.&#34; 
A copy of the platform was obtained by 
The Hill
. 
Among the group’s positions is that election fraud is widespread and the electoral system needs serious reform, including an end to mail-in voting.

On immigration, the group argues that &#34;America is a nation, with a border, and a culture, strengthened by uniquely Anglo-Saxon political traditions.&#34; 
&#34;History has shown that societal trust and political unity are threatened when foreign citizens are imported en-masse into a country, particularly without institutional support for assimilation,&#34; the document reads. 
On infrastructure, the group promotes buildings with &#34;architectural, engineering and aesthetic value that befits the progeny of European architecture.&#34; On coronavirus, the group argues for ending lockdowns and social distancing requirements. 
Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, told reporters he was &#34;looking at&#34; joining the America First caucus. 
When asked about references to &#34;Anglo-Saxon&#34; influence, he said he &#34;hadn&#39;t seen that.&#34;
&#34;It&#39;s not supposed to be about race at all,&#34; Gohmert said.
Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., tweeted Friday that he will be joining the caucus. 
&#34;I’m proud to join
 @mtgreenee
 in the
 #AmericaFirst
 Caucus. We will end wars, stop illegal immigration &amp; promote trade that is fair to American workers,&#34; Gaetz tweeted. &#34;This is just a hit piece from the America Last crowd in Big Media, Big Tech &amp; Big Government.&#34;

&#34;Capitol Hill is full of dirty backstabbing swamp creatures willing to leak gossip to borderline tabloids, like Punchbowl News,&#34; said spokesman Nick Dyer. &#34;Be on the lookout for a public release for the America First Caucus platform when it’s released publicly very soon.&#34;

A photo of independent 
Vermont
 Sen. 
Bernie Sanders
 sitting alone at President Biden&#39;s 
inauguration
 went viral on social media Wednesday.
The photo shows the former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, clad in winter clothes and a mask, sitting in a socially distant crowd watching Biden&#39;s inauguration.

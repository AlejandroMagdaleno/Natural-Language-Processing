Corporate CEO&#39;s join Joe Biden&#39;s attacks on the Peach State&#39;s voting law. 
Sen. Raphael Warnock
, who is a reverend, faced criticism over a tweet posted on 
Easter
 Sunday saying the meaning of the holiday &#34;is more transcendent&#34; than the actual resurrection of Jesus.
The tweet was deleted, but it was picked up by websites like 
Mediaite
 and the Daily Wire. 
&#34;The meaning of Easter is more transcendent than the resurrection of Jesus Christ,&#34; the senior pastor of New Ebenezer Baptist Church&#39;s account said. &#34;Whether you are Christian or not, through a commitment to helping others we are able to save ourselves.&#34;
There are about 2.3 billion Christians across the globe and Easter is one of the holiest days of the year, as it celebrates the resurrection of Jesus. &#34;In doing so, he conquered death and redeemed us from sin if we believe in Him,&#34; according to Christianity.com.
Allie Stuckey, an author and podcast host, tweeted, &#34;There is nothing more transcendent than the resurrection of the God-man, Jesus. Literally: his resurrection transcends our finite conceptions of science &amp; rationality. That the Word became flesh, dwelt among us, then was slain for our sins only to conquer death 3 days later?&#34;
Warnock gave a 
Sunday service
 where he talked in part about life and how -- with the coronavirus --  this season has &#34;been a season of separation.&#34; 
&#34;A lonely season,&#34; he said. He pointed to how Mary Magdalene stood crying alone outside Jesus&#39; tomb, and tied in her experience to how much of life&#39;s suffering – even with support systems like family and friends – is done in solitude. 
&#34;There&#39;s a way in which we all hold the shadows at bay, just so we can survive,&#34; he said. 
Mediaite pointed out that Warnock did get some defenders on Twitter. MSNBC host Joy Reid took issue with former Trump attorney Jenna Ellis for tweeting that Warnock was spreading &#34;a false gospel and heresy.&#34;
Ellis said that the human condition cannot save itself.

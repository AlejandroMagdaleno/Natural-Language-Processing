Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparino reacts to Wall Street’s reduced in-office personnel hurting New York City’s economy.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio did not mince words when talking about the sexual harassment allegations surrounding embattled 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo
.
During a Monday interview with New York City radio station Hot 97, de Blasio was asked about the recent allegations surrounding his state’s governor. The New York City mayor said the allegations &#34;sickened&#34; him.
He also called for a &#34;full investigation&#34; into the allegations against Cuomo, saying the governor’s behavior was &#34;disgusting&#34; and &#34;creepy&#34; if true.
&#34;It sickened me, it sickened me,&#34; said de Blasio. &#34;The thought of a powerful man trying to take advantage of his power, intimidate a young woman and just the sense that he was treating her like — again these are allegations and we need a full investigation — but if that was what truly happened it was like he was treating her like she was his property. Just disgusting, creepy.&#34;
CUOMO BATTLES GROWING BIPARTISAN FIRESTORM OVER SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS AMID LOOMING PROBE
De Blasio went on to criticize Cuomo’s Sunday 
statement
 regarding the sexual harassment allegations, in which the governor claimed he &#34;sometimes&#34; believed he was &#34;being playful&#34; at work and &#34;made jokes&#34; he considered &#34;funny.&#34;
&#34;Sexual harassment is not funny,&#34; the New York City mayor said, asking, &#34;Who the hell tries to explain that by saying I was just joking around?&#34;
&#34;I&#39;ve seen him be abusive in a way that would not be accepted by anyone in leadership,&#34; the mayor said in the interview. He also said he had previously heard the governor use similar language he allegedly used with Assemblyman Ron Kim in a now-
infamous
 phone call.

The organization formed by 
Georgia
 voting rights activist 
Stacey Abrams
, Fair Fight, took to Twitter Wednesday to push back on a Washington Post report fact-checking recent comments made by Abrams regarding the state&#39;s new voting laws.
During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on voting rights last week, Abrams claimed the new law passed in late March &#34;eliminates hours of voting&#34; by placing restrictions on voting times – a statement the 
Washington Post
 awarded two Pinocchios Wednesday.
GOP SENATORS GRILL STACEY ABRAMS ON HER TRUE FEELINGS ON VOTER SECURITY MEASURES
The new GOP-passed law codified that voting locations must be open for at least 8-hour periods during early voting from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., which supporters of the law say expands hours of early voting as it bars locations from offering half-day services.
But Abrams has said it will have the opposite effect and encourage voting sites that operated from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. to open later and close earlier.
&#34;Yes, it codifies that you can vote between 9 to 5 as business hours, but for 78 percent of Georgians, prior to this bill, the hours for voting during early voting was 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.,&#34;  Abrams told Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. &#34;So this actually eliminates hours of voting and mandates only a shortened period of time.&#34;
The new law permits counties to dictate if they want to allow additional hours of operation between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.
The Washington Post, therefore, concluded that Abrams’ language was &#34;misleading&#34; because she implied that voting is now restricted to the 8-hour work-day period.
CONSERVATIVE BLACK LEADERS DEFEND GEORGIA VOTING BILL, HIT &#39;BIASED NEWS MEDIA&#39; COVERAGE
Abrams’ spokesman did not respond to questions but instead directed Fox News to group&#39;s lengthy rebuttal on Twitter.
&#34;This is not accurate,&#34; Fair Fight said on Twitter Wednesday. &#34;Glenn Kessler continues to misstate provisions of SB202 and misinterpret its impact,&#34; the group added, referencing the author of the Post’s report.
 &#34;Anyone familiar with the recent history of GA voter access issues knows these concerns are warranted,&#34; the group wrote Wednesday, issuing more than 10 tweets contesting the report. &#34;Many increasingly competitive counties that maintain GOP election boards consistently try to limit voter access, resulting in measurable and significant impact.&#34;

Fair Fight said that the changes will disproportionately affect Black and Brown voters by slashing in-person and dropbox locations.

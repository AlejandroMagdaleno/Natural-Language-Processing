Fox News correspondent Alex Hogan has the latest on border security efforts on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Border Patrol agents in the Del Rio Sector
 have seen a 911% in illegal immigrants found hiding on trains in the sector’s Uvalde Station compared to the same time last fiscal year – the latest sign of a dramatic surge in illegal immigration at the border, and the state of the 
ongoing border crisis
.
In a press release, Customs and Border Protection said that in FY 2020, Del Rio Sector agents apprehended 372 illegal immigrants. During the current fiscal year, with three months still to go, agents have encountered 3,390.
BORDER PATROL AGENTS SEE 3,166% INREASE IN CONVICTED SEX OFFENDER ARRESTS IN DEL RIO SECTOR
&#34;Uvalde Station continues to see a troubling increase in migrants encountered during train check operations,&#34; Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Austin Skero said in a statement. 
Skero also noted the increased risk due to the heightened summer temperatures in the South.
&#34;They are found hiding in many dangerous storage areas to avoid detection, putting their lives at risk,&#34; he said. &#34;With the increase in temperatures during the summer months, this mode of transportation could turn deadly.&#34;
Fox News has previously reported on a number of instances where migrants are being found in packed U-Haul vans, often with 100+ degree heat.

Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday
 visited the border for the first time since being put in charge of tackling the &#34;root causes&#34; of the migrant surge at the southern border. However, she came under criticism from Republicans and others who accused her of avoiding the harder hit areas of the border for a more politically convenient spot.

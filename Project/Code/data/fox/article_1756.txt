Cesar Millan discusses integrating a rescue dog into the White House on &#39;FOX News Primetime&#39;
Despite having a ruff run of things with first dog Major 
caught up in a biting scandal
, President Biden and first lady Jill Biden announced Friday that they’re bringing a cat to the White House.
&#34;He’s waiting in the wings,&#34; Jill Biden 
told the &#34;Today&#34; show
 — quickly correcting herself that their new pet is actually a &#34;she.&#34;
&#34;She is waiting in the wings,&#34; the first lady said, without giving any further details on the new member of the first family.
BIDEN CLAIMS &#39;WE&#39;VE NOW GOTTEN CONTROL&#39; OF MIGRANT SURGE AT SOUTHERN BORDER, AMID CRITICISM
The president chuckled when interviewer Craig Melvin asked if it &#34;was your idea, Mr. President?&#34;
&#34;No, but it’s easy,&#34; he said with a smile, suggesting he was conceding to pressure from his wife.
Melvin expressed clear surprise that they would risk a cat-astrophe, given that White House pooch Major just needed specialist training 
after two biting incidents
 last month.
&#34;So let me get this straight,&#34; Melvin said. &#34;Major Biden, who’s clearly had some trouble adjusting to life at the White House, now he’s going to be forced to contend with a cat as well?&#34;
&#34;Well, that was part of his training. They took him into a shelter with cats,&#34; the first lady said, with the president saying that the &#34;they&#34; was the Secret Service.

&#34;And he did fine,&#34; Jill Biden insisted of the 3-year-old German shepherd.
&#34;He’s such a sweet, lovable dog. He really is,&#34; she said of Major, who is back in the White House after his training.
When Melvin questioned the claim, the first lady insisted, &#34;He is! I’ll take you to meet him, he’s probably outside now.&#34;

Dave Seminara, former diplomat, argues companies should be selling products and not politics.
Companies in the U.S. are feeling increased pressure to bow to the &#34;woke&#34; left. With more 
businesses
 caving to 
cancel culture
, 
Republicans
 are now calling out corporate America.  
Dave Seminara, author of &#34;Footsteps of Federer,&#34; told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
&#34; Tuesday, the &#34;cultural revolution&#34; in the U.S. is &#34;a sad state of affairs.&#34; He weighed in on the difficulties of being a 
conservative
 during this time period.

politics
 crammed down our throats,&#34; Seminara said.

The former diplomat went on to criticize certain brands that he believes are isolating Americans by selling 
politics
.

&#34;Tell me about your services. But please don&#39;t tell me who to vote for. Don&#39;t tell me what to think. And above all else, don&#39;t insult me and alienate me as one of your customers.&#34;

&#34;Are they selling a product or are they selling a service or are they selling politics?&#34;

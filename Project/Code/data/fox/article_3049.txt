Democratic
 Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney defended Dyjuan Tatro, a former gang member who recently joined the DCCC, as an &#34;extraordinary individual&#34; after backlash to some of Tatro&#39;s anti-
police
 tweets.
Tatro, the DCCC&#39;s newly hired senior adviser for strategic outreach referred to police officers as &#34;
white supremacists
&#34; after the storming of the Capitol in January and condoned looting in the wake of the death of 
George Floyd

NEWLY APPOINTED DCCC ADVISER DELETES TWEETS SLAMMING BIDEN AND HARRIS
&#34;It&#39;s a pretty extraordinary individual you&#39;re talking about,&#34; Maloney said when asked about Tatro during a 
Politico interview
 on Wednesday. &#34;You&#39;re talking about deleted tweets that were before we hired him.&#34;
One of the tweets that landed Tatro in hot water came just weeks before the DCCC announced his new role.
&#34;The answer to white supremacists storming the Capitol is not to give more money to a different group of white supremacists who&#39;s [sic] job it is to uphold white supremacy,&#34; Tatro 
wrote
 in a now-deleted Twitter thread about the Capitol Police budget on Jan. 8.

The DCCC announced Tatro&#39;s hiring in early February.
&#34;The man you&#39;re mentioning, by the way, is the subejct of a Ken Burns documentary. ... The reason Ken Burns made a movie about him is because he turned his life around in prison and has been part of a bipartisan effort at criminal justice reform centered around particularly education in prison,&#34; Maloney told Politico.
Maloney used the opportunity to attack Republicans.

&#34;What you have on the other side is a bunch of racially-based attacks like the ones you&#39;re mentioning and repeating again that are designed to stir up America along racial lines for their short term politcial gain,&#34; he said.
The National Republican Congressional Committee hit back on Wednesday.
&#34;By supporting his senior advisor&#39;s disgusting rhetoric, DCCC Chairman Sean Patrick Maloney confirmed Democrats&#39; disdain for law enforcement is not only accepted, but encouraged,&#34; NRCC spokesman Michael McAdams told Fox News in a statement.
Tatro previously compared reforming police to reviving Nazism.

&#34;To all those people who want to reform the police because all cops aren&#39;t bad, should we just go ahead and revive Nazism because all Nazis weren&#39;t bad? I didn&#39;t think so. Case closed,&#34; he wrote in a now-deleted tweet in June.
In another post, Tatro characterized looting as &#34;protests against systemic racism&#34; in August.
&#34;I don&#39;t understand why you can&#39;t CONDEMN VIOLENT POLICE [and] acknowledge LOOTING as a VITAL form of social PROTEST. And, how about YOU not use sterilized language when referring to state sanctioned murder while maligning protests against the systemic racism that enables it,&#34; Tatro 
responded
 to another user&#39;s tweet about calling for both police reform and condemnation of violence and looting.

Outgoing Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar joins ‘America’s Newsroom’ ahead of his departure from the office Wednesday.
Outgoing Health and Human Services Secretary 
Alex Azar
 claims there is a &#34;concerted effort&#34; among incoming 
Biden
 administration officials to downplay the 
Trump
 administration’s accomplishments fighting the 
coronavirus pandemic
. 
&#34;This is a concerted effort by the new team to down-talk where things are, so they could look like heroes when they come in and just carry forward the momentum that we have established,&#34; Azar told 
Bill Hemmer
 and 
Dana Perino
 on the newly relaunched &#34;
America’s Newsroom
&#34; on Monday.
HHS SECRETARY AZAR RIPS CNN AFTER REPORT OF RESIGNATION: ‘I AM STILL HERE’
The secretary responded to incoming Biden chief of staff Ron Klain’s criticism of the administration’s vaccine rollout and pandemic response. &#34;We’re inheriting a huge mess here,&#34; Klain told CNN’s &#34;State of the Union&#34; on Sunday.
Azar defended his department’s work, touting its success in making COVID-19 vaccine doses available to states. Over 31 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been distributed to states, and 14 million have been administered as of Friday, Azar said. More than 900,000 vaccinations are administered per day, he added.
&#34;There was always going to be a ramp-up here,&#34; Azar said. &#34;It was always going to be part of scaling up. But the key is having those doses available.&#34;
Azar said most governors have rolled out these doses effectively in their states, but that some have struggled. 
&#34;You’ve got some governors who are, frankly, the ones who are failing,&#34; Azar said, citing Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan as states that have administered 50% or less of vaccine doses received. &#34;They’re failing and they’re just looking for somebody else to blame here.&#34; 
The secretary, who has 
served in his post since January 2018
, submitted his resignation letter to President Donald Trump last week, effective Wednesday at noon. &#34;It has been the greatest professional privilege and honor of my life to serve as secretary, and I thank you for the opportunity to serve the American people,&#34; Azar wrote in the letter, which he 
tweeted out Friday night
.

President-elect Joe Biden has 
tapped California Attorney General Xavier Becerra
 to replace Azar in the post.
Azar reflected on his time at the department on &#34;America’s Newsroom,&#34; saying the politicization of the pandemic is the &#34;biggest regret&#34; he has.
&#34;It is not a place to score political points,&#34; Azar said. &#34;My biggest regret is how quickly it became point-scoring between the parties, instead of all just rowing together for the good of the American people.&#34;

New Mexico rancher Amanda Adame tells &#39;Fox &amp;amp; Friends&#39; migrants have been coming close to her house and ask for food and water. 
A rancher from 
New Mexico
 told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
&#34; on Tuesday that 
migrants
 have been getting &#34;fairly close&#34; to her house, even asking for food and water, amid the 
surge
 in illegal crossings at the U.S. southern border. 
Amanda Adame noted that she gives them food and water because they &#34;don&#39;t want to get hurt.&#34; She added that she typically calls Border Patrol when she sees migrants on her property. 
Adame also pointed out a difference between the behavior of the migrants under the Biden administration and the Trump administration. 
&#34;When they [migrants] saw a border agent before, they stopped and they waited and now they keep trying to go,&#34; Adame said, noting that Border Patrol agents &#34;catch them when they see them,&#34; but said the &#34;big problem&#34; is the migrants aren’t always found. 
Biden has scrapped a number of Trump&#39;s policies, which included having asylum seekers remain in Mexico instead of staying in the U.S. while they wait for their cases to be heard.
More than 15,000
 unaccompanied migrant minors are in custody at federal facilities, according to recent reports. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported encounters with more than 100,000 migrants (
minors and otherwise
) in February alone.
When asked what her biggest concern is Adame said, &#34;Now that the border policy has changed, what&#39;s going to happen now?&#34;
&#34;What is he [President Biden] going to do with stopping asylum seekers?&#34; she went on to ask. &#34;I just feel sad for the people who are trying to come in legally and they can&#39;t because of all these asylum seekers.&#34; 
Adame made the comments one day after 
White House officials said
 Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 will play a &#34;diplomatic&#34; role in addressing the migrants surge.
MIGRANT CHILDREN IN BIDEN&#39;S PACKED BORDER FACILITIES NOT BEING COVID-TESTED, CAN&#39;T SOCIAL DISTANCE
President Biden last week appointed Harris to lead his administration’s efforts to address a record surge in migrants, including unaccompanied minors, that has strained capacity at immigration facilities at the southern border in recent weeks.
Adame said that the number of migrants walking through her property has increased drastically and she has also witnessed &#34;a lot&#34; of Border Patrol agents &#34;trying to catch them.&#34;

She stressed that the Biden administration’s immigration policies have essentially given migrants the &#34;green light&#34; to try to come into the country, noting that &#34;they’re not afraid.&#34;

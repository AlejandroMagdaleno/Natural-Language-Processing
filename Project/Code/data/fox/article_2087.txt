Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., praised 
Transportation
 Secretary 
Pete Buttigieg
 as &#34;a future president of the United States&#34; during an event in Alexandria, Virginia, on Tuesday.
&#34;I&#39;m thrilled to be here with my governor, my vice mayor, my secretary of Virginia transportation and Secretary Pete, a future president of the United States,&#34; Beyer 
said
 to applause.
DEMOCRATS MAY BYPASS REPUBLICANS TO MUSCLE THROUGH TRILLION-DOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE BILL
Beyer was the first member of Congress to 
endorse
 Buttigieg&#39;s unsuccessful 2020 presidential run in April 2019. Buttigieg 
dropped out
 of the race less than a year later after failing to hit his campaign&#39;s Super Tuesday fundraising goal of $13 million.
&#34;Secretary Buttigieg is about to preside over the largest infrastructure plan in American history, and who better than a Rhodes scholar? Just kidding,&#34; Beyer said Tuesday, appearing to make a &#34;roads&#34; pun.

Beyer praised Biden for picking Buttigieg for his 
Cabinet
 back in December.
&#34;Choosing Pete Buttigieg to serve as Secretary of Transportation is a brilliant and historic appointment,&#34; Beyer said in a 
statement
. &#34;President-elect Joe Biden has again shown his commitment to diversity and made history with the first-ever nomination of an openly gay American to lead a Cabinet department.&#34;
Beyer&#39;s &#34;future president&#34; comment comes as President Biden appears to be hedging on whether he&#39;ll run for a second term. 
&#34;I plan on running for reelection. That’s my expectation,&#34; Biden 
said
 last week.

Biden&#39;s expected 
infrastructure
 overhaul could give Buttigieg a chance to raise his profile. Senior Democratic officials are proposing as much as 
$3 trillion
 in new spending on a jobs and infrastructure bill that would become the foundation of Biden&#39;s &#34;Build Back Better&#34; program.
Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., was caught on a hot mic last week telling Buttigieg that Democrats will likely have to use reconciliation to pass an infrastructure bill.

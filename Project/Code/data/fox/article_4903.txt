 Financial expert Dan Rocatto breaks down the massive spending bill, analyzes the &#39;transitory&#39; inflation
Rep. 
Ilhan Omar
, D-
Minn
., railed against a judge’s decision to block a 
Minneapolis
 ballot measure that would replace the city&#39;s 
police
 department with a new department of public safety.
During an in-person town hall meeting Tuesday evening in Minneapolis, Omar blamed big money for thwarting a progressive measure that she argued would have given the city &#34;flexibility&#34; on how to better police the city.
&#34;The leaders who are opposed to progress in this city are not nameless or faceless,&#34; she said. &#34;Using your network to obstruct the kind of progress so many people in this city want and were looking forward to is not something that should go unnoticed.&#34;
ILHAN OMAR, KEITH ELLISON SUPPORT MEASURE TO REPLACE MINNEAPOLIS POLICE DEPARTMENT
&#34;This ballot measure should be on the ballot,&#34; she 
said
. &#34;As you can tell, I’m pretty upset about it.&#34;
&#34;We have people pouring in so much money to make us enslaved to a charter that the majority of us [oppose],&#34; she continued. &#34;This is the opposite of what democracy should produce. The people had a vision for what they wanted, and there&#39;s a judge, there&#39;s a mayor, there is a police chief, and their monied friends who are telling us we can&#39;t have a city that is flexible to our needs and to our demands. How else are we supposed to make progress if we can&#39;t do that?&#34;
Omar&#39;s comments came after Hennepin County District Judge Jamie Anderson on Tuesday struck down Question 2 on the Minneapolis ballot for the Nov. 2 
election,
 saying the wording was &#34;unreasonable and misleading.&#34;
The question was to ask voters whether they wanted the city’s charter to be amended to replace the Minneapolis Police Department with a Department of Public Safety, &#34;which could include licensed peace officers (police officers) if necessary, with administrative authority to be consistent with other city departments to fulfill its responsibilities for public safety.&#34;
Omar argued in an 
Aug. 31 op-ed
 for the Star Tribune that the measure was a necessary step in ending police brutality and making communities safer. 
&#34;The truth is the current system hasn&#39;t been serving our city for a long time,&#34; she wrote. &#34;I have long said we need a public safety system that is actually rooted in people&#39;s basic human needs.&#34;
Minnesota
 Attorney General Keith Ellison also endorsed the measure last month, saying Minneapolis residents are eager for police reform and &#34;accountability&#34; after the murder of 
George Floyd
 in the same city last year.

&#34;Fundamentally, communities across [Minneapolis] need &amp; want the possibility for reform &amp; accountability, which the current Charter blocks by locking us into an outdated model for law enforcement and safety. They want to end the cycle of inaction,&#34; 
Ellison tweeted Aug. 31
. 
&#34;This year the residents of [Minneapolis] have asked for and can take that first step of action on the ballot. As a resident of [Minneapolis] where George Floyd’s murder sparked a national call for real reform, I will vote Yes for greater public safety &amp; more human rights for all. #Yes4Minneapolis.&#34;

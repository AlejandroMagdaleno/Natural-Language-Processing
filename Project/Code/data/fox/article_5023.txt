She also delivered boxes to a local shelter for human trafficking survivors, according to the source.
The shelter called The Lifeboat Project thanked Trump in a statement posted to the shelter&#39;s Instagram account, asking readers to put politics aside and focus on the issue at hand.
&#34;Human Trafficking is a crime against humanity, and that alone stands above politics,&#34; the Lifeboat Project wrote. &#34;Today was a beautiful day to put politics aside at The Lifeboat Project and let faith and truth be our topic of connection. We had the opportunity to fill the room with global leaders and have a conversation about our growing world model.&#34;

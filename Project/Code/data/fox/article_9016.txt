EXCLUSIVE:
 After five women made accusations of sexual harassment against one of Rep. 
Rashida Tlaib&#39;s
 2018 campaign consultants, a 
Democratic
 operative who has ties to many high-profile people in the party, the congresswoman condemned the consultant in a statement to Fox News.
T.J. Bucholz, owner of Vanguard Public Affairs, has been accused of sexually harassing former employees in stories by the 
Detroit Free Press
 and 
Eclectablog
 last week.

&#34;The behavior and events described in the accusations against T.J. Bucholz are reprehensible. I commend the courage of all the women who have shared their painful experience working for and with T.J. Bucholz,&#34; Tlaib said in a statement. 
&#34;My campaign ended involvement with T.J. Bucholz and Vanguard Public Affairs in December 2019 for unrelated reasons,&#34; Tlaib continued. &#34;My campaign team and I were not aware of any accusations against T.J. Bucholz during our contractual relationship, and would have ended our ties immediately if we had known of any allegations.&#34;

Activist and consultant Emily Dievendorf detailed Bucholz&#39;s alleged harassment in a 
Facebook post
 on March 18, prompting more women to come forward.
&#34;On other days he would call me over to his desk and ask me to look at his phone. On it were pictures of his wife in a bikini. He would pepper me with questions about whether I thought she was attractive and whether I would have a threesome with them. He would tell me that he had already brought this up with her and she was all for it,&#34; Dievendorf said.
Another staffer said Bucholz threatened to photoshop her in a &#34;sexually compromised position&#34; if she ever left Vanguard Public Affairs, according to the 
Washington Free Beacon
.
Bucholz&#39;s alma mater, Central Michigan University, said it is cutting ties with his firm and placed a staff member who may have known about the harassment on administrative leave pending an investigation, 
MLive.com
 reported.
Tlaib&#39;s campaign paid Bucholz&#39;s firm more than $21,000 in 2018 and more than $5,000 in 2019, according to 
FEC filings
 first reported by the Washington Free Beacon.

Another 
Michigan
 Democrat, Rep. Andy Levin, paid Bucholz&#39;s firm more than $50,000 in 2018, according to 
FEC filings
. 
&#34;The Levin campaign ended our relationship with Vanguard years ago,&#34; a campaign spokeswoman told Fox News in a statement. &#34;Rep. Levin was really sad to learn about what was happening. He admires the bravery of all the women who came forward and hopes we are entering a new era where women in politics and in Lansing are respected and enjoy safer workplaces free from discrimination.&#34;
Fox News&#39; inquiry to Vanguard Public Affairs was not returned at the time of publication.

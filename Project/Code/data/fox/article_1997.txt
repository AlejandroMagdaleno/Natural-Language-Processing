 agents assigned to the Rio Grande City station on Saturday encountered two large groups of 
illegal immigrants
 crossing into the United States, in a possible sign of a deepening crisis at the border. 
CBP agents first responded to a report of a &#34;large group&#34; of illegal immigrants near Las Lomas, Texas – about five miles southeast of Rio Grande City, according to 
U.S. Customs Border and Protection
. 
The agents apprehended 134 illegal immigrants – 128 of whom were identified as family members. The agents determined the individuals were from Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.

A CBP official told Fox News that the individuals are still being processed.
&#34;Even with the spread of the COVID-19 virus, human smugglers continue to try these brazen attempts with zero regard for the lives they endanger nor to the health of the citizens of our great nation,&#34; CBP said in a statement. &#34;The U.S. Border Patrol agents of the Rio Grande Valley Sector will continue to safeguard the nation and community against these criminal elements.&#34;

The back-to-back migrant groups come amid a recent influx of migrants at the southern border – something that the 
Biden administration
 has refused to label a &#34;crisis.&#34;
White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday that the Biden administration recognizes &#34;
this is a big problem
,&#34; but she blamed the issue on former 
President Donald Trump
. 
&#34;The last administration left us a dismantled and unworkable system and, like any other problem, we are going to do all we can to solve it,&#34; she said. 
Asked if the Biden administration has a handle on the unprecedented amount of migrants arriving at the U.S. southern border, Psaki said &#34;we certainly do.&#34;

Texas
 Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order banning &#34;any entity&#34; in the state from enforcing a 
COVID-19
 vaccine mandate.
&#34;The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and our best defense against the virus, but should remain voluntary and never forced,&#34; Abbott said in a press release Monday.
Abbott&#39;s executive order prohibits &#34;any entity&#34; in the state from compelling an individual to receive a COVID-19 vaccine &#34;who objects to such vaccination for any reason of personal conscience.&#34;
The order applies to both employees and consumers who refuse to receive the vaccine due to &#34;religious belief, or for medical reasons, including prior recovery from COVID-19.&#34;
The order will also &#34;supersede any conflicting order&#34; that has already been made by local jurisdictions, authorizing the &#34;maximum fine&#34; allowed under Texas law for any entity that fails to comply with the order.
Abbott also issued a message to the state&#39;s Senate and House of Representatives formally requesting the legislature to consider drafting legislation codifying a similar order into law.
The governor&#39;s move may have come in response to President Biden&#39;s September executive order that will require employers with more than 100 workers to require the vaccine or submit to weekly testing for the virus.

&#34;In yet another instance of federal government overreach, the Biden Administration is now bullying many private entities into imposing COVID-19 vaccine mandates, causing workforce disruptions that threaten Texas&#39;s continued recovery from the COVID-19 disaster,&#34; Abbott said of that order at the time.
Currently, 52% of Texas residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

Arkansas Republican joins &#39;Special Report&#39; with warning about China potentially invading democratic island
Sen. Tom Cotton
, R-Ark., scolded 
Rep. Maxine Waters,
 D-Calif., Monday over what he called &#34;appalling&#34; comments and urged 
President Biden

Cotton emphasized that there is &#34;no grievance, there is no perceived injustice that is a fit object for mob violence,&#34; and called on &#34;the local leaders in Minnesota, the governor, and if necessary, Joe Biden to ensure that there is no rioting or mob violence&#34; once the verdict is delivered.

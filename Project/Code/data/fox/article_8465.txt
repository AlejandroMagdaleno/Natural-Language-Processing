Former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murder, manslaughter in death of George Floyd
Members of the so-called &#34;
Squad
&#34; of House Democrats celebrated that former 
police officer
 Derek Chauvin was 
found guilty
 of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter on Tuesday.
Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., said the verdict &#34;doesn&#39;t change&#34; racism.
WATERS BRUSHES OFF JUDGE’S CRITICISM OVER ‘CONFRONTATIONAL’ COMMENT
&#34;We&#39;ve known Chauvin was guilty since the second we saw him murder George Floyd on film — but we also know of the racism inherent in our carceral and policing systems. This verdict doesn&#39;t change that racism, or the work ahead needed to transform those systems to serve us,&#34; he wrote on 
Twitter
.
&#34;We need justice for Daunte Wright[,] Adam Toledo[,] Tamir Rice[,] Breonna Taylor and everyone else we&#39;ve lost,&#34; Bowman continued.

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., celebrated &#34;long overdue&#34; justice.
&#34;This feels different for our community, justice feels new and long overdue. Rejoice, my beloved community. Grateful to [Attorney General Keith Ellison], jurors, and everyone who made this possible. Alhamdulillah!!&#34; Omar wrote on

In contrast, Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., said &#34;justice would be George Floyd alive today.&#34;
&#34;Our hope is that this verdict will be a small step towards accountability. But that’s just about accountability, not justice. For us, justice would be George Floyd alive today,&#34; Bush wrote on 
Twitter

Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., kept her message succinct.
&#34;Black men, I love you, and you deserve to grow old,&#34; Pressley wrote on 
Twitter

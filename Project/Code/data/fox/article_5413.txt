Former independent counsel Ken Starr provides insight on the impeachment trial on ‘America’s Newsroom.’
Former independent counsel Ken Starr says the 
impeachment
 trial of former President 
Donald Trump
 is an &#34;
unconstitutional
 process&#34; and sets a &#34;very dangerous precedent&#34; because Trump has already left office.
&#34;Every literate member of the audience can pull the Constitution, can read the key sentence: ‘Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than removal,’&#34; Starr said on &#34;
America’s Newsroom
&#34; on Wednesday, quoting the U.S. Constitution. &#34;The natural reading of that ... is what impeachment was meant to be and historically has been.&#34;
LIVE UPDATES: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL DAY 2 TO KICK OFF WITH DEMOCRATS MAKING THEIR CASE
Starr referred to the case of Richard Nixon, who was not impeached after resigning from the presidency.
&#34;In the most relevant historical precedent, that is the resignation of Richard Nixon, it was over,&#34; Starr told 
Bill Hemmer
 and 
Dana Perino
. &#34;There was no suggestion that, well, we need to continue this process and try him and disqualify him in the future because he will remain a clear and present danger.&#34; 
TRUMP&#39;S IMPEACHMENT TRIAL: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW

Starr argued the House should have begun the impeachment process before Trump left office.
&#34;They should have marched the article over and then the Chief Justice [John Roberts] would have presided,&#34; Starr said. &#34;We now have a non-impartial, a partial presiding officer [Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the Senate’s president pro tempore], which is just another indication that this is an unconstitutional process.&#34;
Starr was a 
member of Trump’s legal team
 for his 
first impeachment trial
, during which he was acquitted by the Senate on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. At the time of Trump’s first impeachment, Starr called the proceedings an &#34;
ugly chapter
&#34; in American legal history.

First Lady Dr. Jill Biden held a virtual reception Wednesday for guests invited to watch 
President Biden’s
 first 
address to Congress
 – an unusual event held in light of strict coronavirus restrictions.
Guests of the first lady would traditionally sit in her viewing box for the president’s speech, but with invite-only protocols issued to top Congressional leaders, even Biden’s guests were barred from the event.
But her guests were able to land the reception with the first lady, addressing top political issues facing the country, like gun violence, immigration and transgender rights.
BIDEN&#39;S ADDRESS TO CONGRESS: EVERYTHING TO KNOW
The White House said each of the lirst lady’s guests &#34;personify some of the issues or policies&#34; that the president will address in his message to Congress Wednesday night.
&#34;Every morning for the last 100 days Joe has awakened with a sense of urgency,&#34; the first lady said, acknowledging shared challenges across the nation like the coronavirus pandemic, access to broadband and childcare. &#34;He knows that you’re counting on him for real solutions and that you can’t wait.
Biden invited six guests to virtually share their stories, including a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient-turned-nurse who has cared for COVID-19 patients since the pandemic started.
Javier Quiroz Castro, who used his lunch break to speak with the First Lady from Houston, Texas about DACA, said the program allowed him to get his position as a nurse and become a &#34;contributing member of society.&#34;
Castro was joined by Stella Keating, the first transgender teenager to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of the Equality Act.
&#34;I hope you decide to run for office,&#34; Biden told Keating. &#34;Politics is an honorable business and I think that we have to lift up that whole idea.
&#34;Look at the change that you’re making, and I’m really proud of you,&#34; Biden concluded.

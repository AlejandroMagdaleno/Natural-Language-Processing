Former Trump aide Stephen Miller sounds off on &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39;
Department of 
Homeland Security
 Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas complained he’s working 18-hour days when pressed on why he couldn&#39;t provide specifics for the second day in a row on the number of 
migrants
 processed in the U.S. and their whereabouts.
During a virtual hearing with the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., asked Mayorkas to provide the same information he was asked for during a Senate hearing a day earlier.
MAYORKAS INSISTS BORDER IS CLOSED AS MIGRANTS STREAM ACROSS
&#34;Let me ask you, secretary, of the 1.5 million people that we’ve apprehended, how many people have been returned?&#34; Gimenez asked. &#34;How many people are being detained? And how many people have been dispersed?&#34; 
Mayorkas replied, &#34;I would be pleased to provide you with specific data subsequent to this hearing, congressman.&#34;
&#34;Well, sir, yesterday you were asked exactly the same question, and you gave exactly the same answer,&#34; Gimenez fired back. &#34;You’d think you’d be a little bit better prepared.&#34;
Mayorkas explained that despite working 18-hour days he was focused on his &#34;mission&#34; and did not have those numbers readily available.
&#34;Well, congressman, let me share something with you quite clearly,&#34; Mayorkas said. &#34;I work 18 hours a day, OK? So when I returned from yesterday’s hearing, I actually focused on mission. We will get that data, both to the senator who posed it yesterday and to you, congressman, today.&#34;
The exchange comes a day after Sen. Ron Johnson, R-
Wisc.
, demanded the DHS secretary provide at least &#34;ballpark&#34; estimates for how many migrants apprehended since October are still being detained, as well as how many have been deported and how many have been released into the U.S.
&#34;Senator, I would be pleased to provide you with that data, &#34; Mayorkas replied Tuesday before being cut off by Johnson.
&#34;I want them now,&#34; Johnson said. &#34;Why don’t you have that information now?&#34;
&#34;Senator, I do not have that data before me,&#34; Mayorkas responded, adding that he wanted to be &#34;accurate.&#34;

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during her daily press briefing Wednesday that it was a &#34;fair question&#34; to ask Mayorkas, but that she couldn&#39;t provide the numbers either.
DHS &#34;would have the most up-to-date numbers,&#34; Psaki said.

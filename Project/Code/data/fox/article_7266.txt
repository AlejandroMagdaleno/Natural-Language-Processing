Fox News correspondent David Lee Miller has the latest on employers enforcing vaccine mandates on &#39;America&#39;s Newsroom&#39;
The influential American Postal Workers Union on Wednesday said, at this point, it opposes a coronavirus vaccine mandate from the 
Biden administration
 but encouraged workers to voluntarily take the jabs. 
&#34;While the APWU leadership continues to encourage postal workers to voluntarily get vaccinated, it is not the role of the federal government to mandate vaccinations for the employees we represent,&#34; the union said in a statement 
obtained by Fox News.

The union did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News. The union said in the statement that the safety of its workers is &#34;of paramount importance&#34; but &#34;at this time the APWU opposes the mandating of COVID-19 vaccinations.&#34;
The Food and Drug Administration in December
 approved the Emergency Use Authorization for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines
. But there is a distinction between the EUA and full FDA approval. President Biden said at a recent CNN town hall that he believes the full FDA approval should be granted by the fall. A full FDA approval means that companies and government bodies will have a firmer legal footing to mandate the jabs.
Biden said he is considering requiring all federal employees to be vaccinated. 
&#34;That&#39;s under consideration right now but if you&#39;re not vaccinated you&#39;re not nearly as smart as I thought you were,&#34; Biden said Wednesday. &#34;We have a pandemic because of the unvaccinated, and they&#39;re sowing enormous confusion.&#34;
Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, told C-SPAN that the union supports vaccine mandates, according to Reuters.

&#34;If you come back in and you&#39;re are not vaccinated, everybody in that workplace is jeopardized,&#34; Trumka said.
Reuters, citing a source familiar with the matter, reported that Biden is expected Thursday to announce that about two million civilian federal workers &#34;will need to be vaccinated or face testing, social distancing, mask requirements and limits on travel.&#34;

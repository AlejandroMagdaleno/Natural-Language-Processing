Senate Minority Leader 
Mitch McConnell
 said Monday that he would block a 
Supreme Court
 nominee from 
President Biden
 in 2024 if Republicans are in the Senate majority – just as he did in 2016 after the death of late Justice Antonin Scalia. 
McConnell, R-Ky., made the comment in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. The commitment follows a controversial decision McConnell made last year to plow ahead in confirming Justice Amy Coney Barrett less than two weeks before Election Day. 
&#34;I think in the middle of a presidential election, if you have a Senate of the opposite party of the president, you have to go back to the 1880s to find the last time a vacancy was filled,&#34; McConnell told Hewitt. 
&#34;So I think it’s highly unlikely. In fact, no, I don’t think either party if it controlled, if it were different from the president, would confirm a Supreme Court nominee in the middle of an election,&#34; McConnell added. &#34;What was different in 2020 was we were of the same party as the president.&#34;

MCCONNELL HITS BACK AT AOC&#39;S CRITICISM: SHE CAN&#39;T EVEN SELL HER FAR-LEFT AGENDA TO HER OWN PARTY
Indeed, McConnell said as early as Feb. 22, 2016, that &#34;the Senate has not filled a vacancy arising in an election year when there was divided government since 1888, almost 130 years ago.&#34; For that reason, McConnell says, Republicans were being consistent when they confirmed Barrett after stonewalling now-Attorney General Merrick Garland&#39;s Supreme Court nomination in 2016. 
But Democrats accused Republicans of naked hypocrisy for confirming a Supreme Court justice during an election year in 2020 after declining to do so in 2016. 
&#34;Let the record show that tonight, the Republican Senate majority decided to thwart the will of the people and confirm a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election, after a more than 60 million Americans have voted,&#34; then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said when Barrett was nominated. 
&#34;And let the record show that tonight, the Republican majority will make a mockery of its own stated principle — that the American people deserve a voice in the selection of Supreme Court Justices — completing the partisan theft of two seats on the Supreme Court using completely contradictory rationales,&#34; Schumer, now the majority leader, added.

McConnell on Monday also panned the push by some Democrats to pack the Supreme Court, citing Clinton-appointed Justice Stephen Breyer&#39;s recent comments about the danger of politicizing the Supreme Court in that way. 
&#34;You mentioned Justice Breyer. I do want to give him a shout-out,&#34; McConnell said on Hewitt&#39;s program. &#34;[H]e joined what Justice Ginsburg said in 2019 that nine is the right number for the Supreme Court. And I admire him for that. I think even the liberal justices on the Supreme Court have made it clear that court packing is a terrible idea.&#34;
McConnell also discussed the infrastructure proposal by a bipartisan group of senators, saying the effort has a &#34;maybe 50-50&#34; chance of success. But McConnell also laid out Republicans&#39; &#34;red lines,&#34; including repealing the 2017 tax cuts.

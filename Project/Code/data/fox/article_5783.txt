Police in Irving, 
Texas
, have identified the man who shot and killed himself outside of GOP 
Rep. Beth Van Duyne’s
 home as former campaign staffer Chris Dillard, according to a report Thursday.
Dillard, 55, served as Van Duyne’s communications director from November 2019 to April 2020 and was a prominent local GOP activist. The Irving Police Department confirmed his identity on Thursday, the 
Dallas Morning News
 reported.
Van Duyne was at her home in Irving on Wednesday afternoon when she heard a gunshot and saw a man lying in the front yard. The lawmaker called police and officers discovered the man, later identified as Dillard. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
&#34;She is shocked and saddened that someone would take their own life,&#34; a representative for Van Duyne said in a statement following the incident.
Police were expected to provide further details about their investigation at a press conference Thursday afternoon.

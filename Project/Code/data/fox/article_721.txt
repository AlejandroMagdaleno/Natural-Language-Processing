Fox News White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich joins &#39;Special Report&#39; with the details
President Biden
 appeared to go back on his campaign promise to &#34;take responsibility&#34; as commander-in-chief and not &#34;blame others&#34; during his speech on the botched withdrawal from 
Afghanistan
 that has seen the Taliban swiftly retake control of the country – and outcome Biden previously claimed was &#34;highly unlikely.&#34;
Biden on Monday suggested that the withdrawal debacle was the result of the peace deal he &#34;inherited&#34; from former President Donald Trump and claimed his only options were between &#34;escalating the conflict and sending thousands of American troops back into Afghanistan.&#34;
&#34;I stand squarely behind my decision. After 20 years, I learned the hard way that there was never a good time to withdraw U.S. forces,&#34; Biden said. &#34;That’s why we&#39;re still there.&#34;

Biden also pointed fingers at the Afghan army for lacking &#34;the will to fight&#34; for their future. And he said the slow-moving pace of evacuating the U.S.&#39;s Afghan allies was in part because &#34;some of the Afghans did not want to leave earlier — still hopeful for their country.&#34;

The comments contrast with then-candidate Biden&#39;s promise to do his &#34;job and take responsibility&#34; for his actions.
&#34;It&#39;s hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I’ll do my job and take responsibility,&#34; Biden wrote in June 2020. &#34;I won&#39;t blame others. And I&#39;ll never forget that the job isn&#39;t about me — it&#39;s about you.&#34;
When pressed for comment, 
White House
 spokesperson Andrew Bates points out how Biden also said, &#34;the buck stops with me.&#34;
White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted in defense of the president’s remarks, saying Biden &#34;made clear that he will not ask Americans to fight and and die in a war that the Afghan military is not willing to fight for itself.&#34;

The president&#39;s East Room remarks came after he traveled back to D.C. from Camp David, where he had bunkered down amid the fallout of Afghanistan&#39;s stunning collapse. 
Biden took no questions after the speech, hurrying out of the East Room and traveling back to the presidential retreat.

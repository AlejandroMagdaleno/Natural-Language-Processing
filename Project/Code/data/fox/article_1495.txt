President Biden
 said U.S. troops will be out of 
Afghanistan
 sooner than his original Sept. 11 deadline, telling reporters Thursday U.S. forces will be home by Aug. 31. 
&#34;In this context, speed is safety,&#34; Biden told reporters, adding that not a single U.S. military member has been lost during the withdrawal process. 
&#34;The United States did what we went to do in Afghanistan – to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 and to deliver justice to Usama bin Laden,&#34; he continued. &#34;We did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build.&#34;
GRIM END TO AFGHANISTAN WAR: NO &#39;MISSION ACCOMPLISHED&#39; OR &#39;MOMENT OF CELEBRATION,&#39; WHITE HOUSE SAYS
The president’s comments run counter to White House press secretary Jen Psaki’s claim Thursday that the U.S. will not have a &#34;mission accomplished moment.&#34;
&#34;It&#39;s a 20-year war that has not been won militarily,&#34; she told reporters. 
But Biden struck down this argument and said that in preventing future attacks from Al Qaeda and killing Usama bin Laden, the U.S. had &#34;accomplished&#34; its goal. 
VETS DEMAND BIDEN TAKE ACTION FOR AFGHAN INTERPRETERS, OTHER ALLIES
The president further pushed back on some GOP calls to remain in Afghanistan as the Taliban gains in strength.
Biden said it is the &#34;right and responsibility&#34; of the Afghan people to decide how their country will function, and the impetus of the government to protect the nation’s sovereignty.
The U.S. will continue to provide air support for Afghani military forces, along with humanitarian and civilian assistance on important issues surrounding women’s rights. 
TALIBAN SURGES AS BIDEN PULLS US TROOPS OUT OF AFGHANISTAN, WITH EXPERTS WARNING OF &#39;FOREIGN POLICY DISASTER&#39;
But Biden doubled down on his decision not to leave a standing military force and posed the question, &#34;How many thousands more of America’s daughters and sons are you willing to risk?&#34;
&#34;How long would you have them stay?&#34; he continued. &#34;I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan.&#34;
&#34;Staying would have meant U.S. troops taking casualties,&#34; Biden added. 
The War in Afghanistan, the United States&#39; longest-running war, saw more than 2,400 deaths and nearly 21,000 wounded.

During the 20-year period, American troops trained more than 300,000 Afghan military members and security forces to help them combat the threat of the Taliban. 
Despite the training efforts and attempted peace deal by the U.S., the Taliban is estimated to have gained control over at least 50 of Afghanistan’s 370 districts.

&#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39; host presses Gov. Hutchinson on why he vetoed a bill banning youth gender reassignment surgeries
Former President 
Donald Trump
 blasted 
Arkansas
 Republican Gov. 
Asa Hutchinson
 for vetoing legislation that would have made his state the first to ban puberty blockers for minors who identify as transgender.
&#34;Asa Hutchinson, the lightweight RINO Governor of Arkansas, just vetoed a Bill that banned the CHEMICAL CASTRATION OF CHILDREN,&#34; Trump said in a statement on Thursday. &#34;&#39;Bye-bye Asa,&#39; that&#39;s the end of him! Fortunately for the Great State of Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders will do a fantastic job as your next Governor!&#34;
ARKANSAS GOV VETOES BILL BANNING GENDER HORMONES, SURGERIES FOR TRANSGENDER YOUTH
On Tuesday, Hutchinson appeared on &#34;
Tucker Carlson Tonight
&#34; and 
said
 the bill presented to him &#34;was overbroad, it was extreme.&#34;

&#34;This is the first law in the nation that invokes the state between medical decisions, parents who consent to that and the decision of the patient. And so, this goes way too far. And in fact, it doesn&#39;t even have a grandfather clause [for] those young people that are under hormonal treatment,&#34; he argued. 
Hutchinson said he would have supported legislation that restricted only &#34;reassignment surgery,&#34; which currently is not performed on minors in the state.

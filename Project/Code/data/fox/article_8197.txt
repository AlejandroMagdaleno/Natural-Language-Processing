Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, reacted to the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump and the House of Representatives pushing ahead with the $15 minimum wage increase.
The
 $15 minimum
 
wage
 increase is a &#34;progressive dream that would cost over a million American jobs,&#34; Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said on Wednesday.
&#34;Well, this is a progressive dream,&#34; Ernst told &#34;
America&#39;s Newsroom
.&#34;
A federally mandated minimum wage increase would have different implications for states in middle America than it would for a city like New York, Ernst argues.
&#34;I love hearing folks like Chuck Schumer arguing for a 15-dollar minimum wage when he is in New York City, which is a high cost of living state and city. But what they are forgetting, these progressive liberals, is the folks in Middle America where our cost of living is much lower,&#34; Ernst said.
DEMS ON HOUSE COMMITTEE APPROVE $15 MINIMUM WAGE IN STIMULUS PACKAGE DESPITE CBO WARNING 1.4M JOBS AT RISK
Ernst&#39;s comments came after 
Democrats
 on the House Committee on Education and Labor approved a $15 federal minimum wage proposal included in 
President Biden
&#39;s 
coronavirus
 relief package in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
&#34;It&#39;s a wrap, $15 #MinimumWage passes the [Education and Labor] committee after more than 13 hours of debate,&#34; committee member 
Rep. Ilhan Omar
, D-Minn., wrote on 
Twitter
 around 4:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

Ernst pressed that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour will put 1.4 million Americans out of work.
&#34;We don&#39;t want to say that we don&#39;t want to kill small business. I think this is a decision that is better left up to our states and localities,&#34; she said.
Furthermore, she said that Biden&#39;s coronavirus package includes &#34;liberal elitist pipe dreams.&#34;
&#34;It is more than Iowans want to spend. They want to focus on COVID-19 recovery. And that&#39;s not what this bill is all about. It&#39;s about bailing out, bailing out states with bad behavior, with their budgets, and it&#39;s about raising the federal minimum wage. What we need to do is open the economy and get people back to work.&#34;

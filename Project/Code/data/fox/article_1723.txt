The 
Biden
 White House released its first round of 
visitor logs
 Friday in an effort to &#34;restore integrity, transparency, and trust in government,&#34; the administration said.
The logs include a list of 400 individuals who visited the White House campus during the month of January for tours, appointments and business meetings.
The White House said it expects an increase in visitors as the coronavirus pandemic continues to subside across the U.S.
BIDEN WHITE HOUSE NOT RELEASING VIRTUAL VISITOR LOGS AS WATCHDOGS CALL FOR TRANSPARENCY
&#34;The Biden-Harris Administration will be the first administration to post visitor logs from its first full year in office,&#34; the White House said in a statement Friday, adding that new logs will be released on a monthly basis going forward.
In contrast, the 
Trump
 White House did not release any visitor log records due to national security and privacy concerns.
The Biden White House also said that in keeping with the Obama administration’s transparency policy, they would not be releasing any records that &#34;implicate privacy, national security, or other concerns.&#34;
The current administration came under some scrutiny earlier this year for their slow release of the White House’s 
visitor logs
.
Led by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), 43 open-government organizations penned a 
letter
 to President Biden urging him to make transparency a top priority of his administration.

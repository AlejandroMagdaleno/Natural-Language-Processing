There&#39;s a hairy situation brewing at the 
White House
.
High-profile dog experts are speaking out about what they believe is really causing 
President Biden&#39;s
 dog 
Major
 to act out after he reportedly bit two people at the White House in recent weeks, according to a report. 
Cesar Millan, known for the Emmy-nominated television series &#34;Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan,&#34; described the White House environment as &#34;a place full of tension.&#34; He said the problem doesn&#39;t lie with Major, but the situation and people the dog is surrounded by. 
BIDEN SHOULD KEEP DOG MAJOR AWAY FROM PEOPLE AFTER 2ND BITE: LAWYERS

&#34;It’s not the dog,&#34; he told Politico. &#34;What Major is saying is that he doesn’t feel safe yet. And if he doesn’t feel safe, he can’t trust. And if he can’t trust, he can’t feel calm.&#34;
Professional dog trainer Larry Krohn said a dog&#39;s behavior, whether it&#39;s good or bad, is created in the environment that the canine lives in. &#34;Where it spends its time. The people it spends its time with,&#34; he said. 
Krohn added that behavior comes out of fear and insecurities, which he said is typical in the German shepherd breed -- like Major, &#34;especially when it’s not a well-bred dog.&#34;
&#34;And you can’t punish that out of a dog ... you can’t treat that out of a dog,&#34; he said, 
according to Politico
. &#34;You have to change the mindset of the dog to where they feel comfortable and confident in their own skin and they trust the people around them.&#34;
The 
series of biting incidents
 started in March when Major, 3, sank his teeth into a Secret Service employee, who required attention from the White House medical unit. White House press secretary Jen Psaki referred to that incident as &#34;minor.&#34; 
After the first bite occurred, Major and Biden&#39;s seemingly less rambunctious, older German Shepherd, Champ, 13, were sent to Wilmington, Delaware, to be looked after by a family friend. They later returned to the White House, reports said. 
During an interview with &#34;
Good Morning America
,&#34; Biden said Major was going home and he &#34;didn&#39;t banish him to home.&#34;
BIDEN&#39;S DOG MAJOR BITES ANOTHER WHITE HOUSE EMPLOYEE
&#34;We have a dogsitter there -- a friend who takes him. And -- but you turn a corner and there&#39;s -- there&#39;s two people I don&#39;t know at all. And, you know, and they move -- and he moves to protect. But he is -- he&#39;s a sweet dog,&#34; Biden said. &#34;Eighty-five percent of the people there love him. He just -- all he does is lick them and wag his tail.&#34;
But late last month, Major bit an employee on the White House South Lawn, who then required medical attention.
First lady Jill Biden’s press secretary Michael de Rosa confirmed the &#34;nip&#34; in a statement to Fox News. &#34;Major is still adjusting to his new surroundings and he nipped someone while on a walk. Out of an abundance of caution, the individual was seen by WHMU [White House medical unit] and then returned to work without injury.&#34;
CNN first reported the bite, adding the employee worked for the National Park Service.

Celebrity animal trainer Joel Silverman referenced Biden&#39;s &#34;Good Morning America&#34; interview and suggested that &#34;nobody is looking at this thing from the very beginning as a serious thing.&#34; 
&#34;When the dog bites one time, it’s something people need to take a look at,&#34; Silverman told Politico. &#34;When you have the owner — I don’t care if you’re the president of the United States or you’re just an average dog trainer like myself — if you are answering a question and blowing off an issue about the biting, that’s a problem. That’s a red flag.&#34;
&#34;Ask not what the dog can do for you. Ask what you can do for the dog,&#34; Millan added.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki is asked about Sen. Joe Manchin&#39;s criticism of attempts to eliminate the filibuster. 
Republicans on Friday blasted President Biden&#39;s request for $753 billion for next fiscal year’s 
defense budget
, saying it&#39;s not enough to counter 
China&#39;s military
 modernization plans. 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., along with other top Senate Republicans, accused the president of prioritizing a &#34;liberal wish list&#34; while &#34;funding for America’s military is neglected.&#34;
CHINA BOOSTS MILITARY SPENDING AS GOP DEMANDS BIDEN DO THE SAME
While Biden’s budget is a slight increase from the $704 billion allotted for defense spending in fiscal year 2021, it actually equates to a decrease in spending by about half a percent after inflation, first reported 
Bloomberg
.
Republicans have called the budget &#34;disappointing&#34; and alleged it will not hold up next to China’s continual expanse in defense spending.
&#34;China aspires to overtake America as the world’s dominant superpower. Over the past decade, China’s defense spending has increased by $200 billion, while America’s has decreased by $400 billion,&#34; the GOP group, including Senators Marco Rubio, Jim Inhofe, Lindsey Graham and Richard Shelby, said in a statement.  &#34;China’s military investments match its desire to out-compete America and hold our military forces at risk.&#34;
Earlier this year, China announced a 7% percent increase to its military spending budget for fiscal year 2022 – a figure that amounts to $208.6 billion.
But U.S. lawmakers are concerned about Beijing’s plan to modernize its military, highlighted in a Defense Department report released in September 2020.
House Republicans urged Biden to increase the military budget by three to five percent 
last month
 -- more than double the 1.7% increase that the president allotted to the 2022 annual defense budget.
&#34;President Biden’s budget proposal cuts defense spending, sending a terrible signal not only to our adversaries in Beijing and Moscow but also to our allies and partners,&#34; the GOP senators wrote.
But while congressional Republicans are frustrated by the lack of increased spending, some Democrats were equally irked at what they view as a &#34;bloated&#34; defense budget.

Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Democrat Sen. Bernie Sanders, said he had &#34;serious concerns&#34; about the defense budget.
&#34;At a time when the U.S. already spends more on the military than the next 12 nations combined, it is time for us to take a serious look at the massive cost over-runs, the waste and fraud that currently exists at the Pentagon,&#34; Sanders said Friday.

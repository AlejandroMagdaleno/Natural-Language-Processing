Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson tells ‘Fox News Sunday’ why he decided to ease coronavirus restrictions in his state. 
Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson hit back after 
President Biden
 slammed Republicans for loosening 
coronavirus
 restrictions in their states.
Biden took a swipe at Republican 
governors
 in Texas and Mississippi on Wednesday, accusing them of &#34;
Neanderthal thinking

THESE ARE THE STATES REOPENING, ROLLING BACK MASK MANDATES AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC
&#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say it&#39;s Neanderthal-type thinking,&#34; Hutchinson told &#34;Fox News Sunday.&#34; &#34;It&#39;s pretty natural to have a sensitivity to freedom-loving Americans that say we&#39;ll do the right thing. We know what to do. Just give us our freedom back and lift some of our mandates. ... That&#39;s not caveman thinking, that&#39;s common sense.&#34;
As of Friday, businesses including gyms, restaurants and salons will no longer face penalties for ignoring guidelines about business capacity. However, businesses will lose liability immunity if they violate state guidelines.

&#34;There&#39;s a limit as to how much the restrictions can be placed on business and for how long. They&#39;ve struggled. They&#39;ve suffered,&#34; Hutchinson said. &#34;At some point we have to rely upon common sense and good judgment versus mandates, particularly for our businesses.&#34;

vaccines

&#34;The president says we need to vaccinate all the teachers. Well, we did that. We moved them up in our priority list early on,&#34; Hutchinson said. &#34;That&#39;s important for governors to able to lead their state.&#34;

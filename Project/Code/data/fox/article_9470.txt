Former assistant U.S. attorney Andy McCarthy says Garland&#39;s his son-in-law profits &#39;lucratively&#39; from advocating for CRT across the nation.
Four out of the eight members of the U.S Commission on 
Civil Rights
 have penned a 
letter
 to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, chastising him for his recent memo regarding parents who protest school boards.
&#34;We write to express our concerns regarding a recent memorandum issued by your office,&#34; the four members wrote in the letter, questioning Garland&#39;s motive for issuing the 
memo
 which instructed the FBI to take the lead on a task force to address threats against 
school
 officials, including creating a centralized way to report such threats.
The members who signed onto the letter include Commissioners Peter Kirsanow, J. Christian Adams, Gail Heriot, and Stephen Gilchrist.
&#34;Your memorandum did not cite any specific examples of ‘harassment, intimidation and threats of violence’ that would provide any basis for law enforcement action by the Department,&#34; the letter read. &#34;We are concerned that much of what the NSBA calls threats and acts of intimidation—and compares to &#34;domestic terrorism and hate crimes&#34;—can be merely classified as political speech.&#34;
FLORIDA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION DENOUNCES NATIONAL GROUP&#39;S CALL FOR FEDERAL INVOLVEMENT IN PARENT PROTESTS
Providing examples of 
political speech
, the members insisted that &#34;a parent concerned with a local schoolboard’s policy may portend an electoral challenge against an incumbent schoolboard member,&#34; adding that a move like that &#34;would be well within the parent’s First Amendment rights and well without the Department’s purview as a federal law enforcement agency.&#34;
&#34;We have combed the internet for signs that parents petitioning school boards are anything approaching a national problem,&#34; the members continued in the letter. &#34;Nearly all of what we have seen so far makes us proud to be Americans: Parents care about the education of their children, and they are not willing to allow them to be indoctrinated into a radical ideology.&#34;
MAJORITY OF PARENTS WANT A SAY IN THEIR KIDS&#39; EDUCATION, FOX NEWS POLL FINDS
The members also concluded that if &#34;a few of these parents have gotten out of hand and made threats,&#34; then local law enforcement is &#34;entirely appropriate&#34; in handling the situation. The members also asked Garland whether he is surprised that &#34;concerned parents across the country view [his] memorandum as an endorsement of the NSBA’s description of their protests as comparable to &#34;domestic terrorism.&#34;
The members closed the letter by asking Garland to provide &#34;specific examples&#34; of &#34;harassment, intimidation and threats of violence&#34; which Garland claimed as evidence for the need for federal intervention.

Garland&#39;s memo came shortly after the National School Boards Association (NSBA) sent a letter to President Biden claiming some rhetorical clashes between school boards and parents may amount to &#34;domestic terrorism.&#34; The NSBA letter 
invoked
 the Patriot Act, which Congress passed to deal with terrorism in the wake of the 9-11 attacks.

Co-anchors Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino hit the streets of reopened Manhattan as Dana&#39;s dog, Jasper, makes his &#39;America&#39;s Newsroom&#39; debut. 
Fox News host Dana Perino announced Saturday that her dog Jasper, who she has often featured on television over the years, has passed away. 
&#34;It is its deep sadness that I have to let you all know that Jasper passed away today,&#34; Perino tweeted on Saturday about the 9-year-old canine’s passing.
PERINO, HEMMER GRILL PENTAGON SPOKESMAN JOHN KIRBY ON ABANDONED AMERICANS, BIDEN&#39;S BROKEN PROMISE: &#39;WHY?&#39;
In a lengthy Instagram 
post,
 Perino referred to Jasper as &#34;America’s Dog&#34; and said he died from a fast spreading cancer.
&#34;It is with broken hearts that Peter and I have to let you know that Jasper, America’s Dog, died today,,&#34; Perino wrote. &#34;A fast spreading cancer caused him to leave us sooner than we’d ever hoped. We got to send him off - talking about all the fishing he can do in Heaven.&#34;

Perino continued, &#34;My apologies if this post feels impersonal - so many of you have helped us raise Jasper to become the wonderful, hilarious, legend that he was. It would be impossible to reach all of you as I’d like to - truly a dog has never been so loved and supported.&#34;
Perino expressed her &#34;deepest thanks&#34; to her Fox News colleagues and &#34;loyal audience&#34; who have &#34;tolerated my talking about Jasper for years&#34; and thanked those who have sent her paintings of Jasper over the years.

&#34;What can you do for us?&#34; Perino said. &#34;Love each other. Hold on tight to your loved ones - including all of your pets. And love boldly and fully.&#34;
Jasper appeared with Perino on Fox News often and wrote a 
book
 about him titled &#34;Let Me Tell You about Jasper: How My Best Friend Became America&#39;s Dog.&#34;

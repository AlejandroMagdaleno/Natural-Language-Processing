Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-
Wash.,
 is urging Democrats to abandon hope of a bipartisan deal on infrastructure and instead push through an agreementl without GOP support. 
Jayapal, chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in a statement: &#34;In case it wasn’t clear already, it certainly is now: Republicans are not going to do what needs to be done for working families.&#34;
&#34;We know Mitch ‘100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration’ won’t be coming around on a deal,&#34; the Washington Democrat wrote in an earlier tweet. &#34;Time to go big, bold, and alone.&#34;
She urged Congress to &#34;immediately begin working on budget resolutions to pass the American Jobs and Families Plan through reconciliation so we can deliver on our promises.&#34;
Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, D-N.Y., also urged the Senate to take up the bill through reconciliation. &#34;So that bill I hope we passed a reconciliation, so that it can be bold and responsive to meet the needs,&#34; she said Wednesday. 
MANCHIN PUSHES BACK AGAINST DEM-ONLY INFRASTRUCTURE BILL 
The statement came shortly after President Biden walked away from a deal weeks in the making with Sen. Shelley Capito, R-W.Va. to come up with a deal both parties could agree on in lieu of his $2.25 trillion American Jobs Plan. 
On Wednesday, 90 progressive advocacy groups wrote an 
open letter 
to Democrats demanding they move forward on passing Biden’s infrastructure agenda through reconciliation, a budget process that allows bills to pass with a simple majority rather than 60 votes. 
BIDEN ENDS INFRASTRUCTURE TALKS WITH CAPITO 
Even if Democrats were to move forward with a one-party infrastructure proposal, they’d be caught on a snag with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. 
Asked Tuesday whether he supported using budget reconciliation to pass the package, Manchin said: &#34;I’m not even close to the thought process on that. We’re just trying to find an infrastructure bill we can all agree on.&#34;

Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Jon Tester, D-Mont., Bill Cassidy, R-La., Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz.

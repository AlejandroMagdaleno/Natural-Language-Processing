FOX News correspondent Casey Stegall joins &#39;Special Report&#39; with the latest from the southern border
Vice President Harris
 dodged a question about the migrant crisis at the 
southern border
 and how it&#39;s affecting unaccompanied children on Tuesday.
&#34;I haven’t been briefed on anything today about it yet, but I will when I get on the plane,&#34; Harris told reporters before boarding a plane to leave Colorado, where she took part in a small business roundtable earlier in the day.
BIDEN ADMIN CAN&#39;T KEEP UP WITH BORDER SURGE OF MIGRANT CHILDREN, CBP OFFICIAL WARNS
Harris&#39; response comes as the Biden administration has refused to call the perilous border situation a crisis.

&#34;We certainly also recognize because the president and our administration has made a decision that the way to humanely approach immigration is to allow for unaccompanied children to come and be treated with humanity and be in a safe place while we’re ... trying to get them into homes and sponsors homes,&#34; White House press secretary Jen Psaki 
said
 last week. 
Psaki spoke a day after Customs and Border Protection announced that 
the agency encountered
 100,441 individuals in February, a 28% increase over January, the agency said. Of those, 19,246 individuals were in family units, 9,457 were unaccompanied children (UACs) and 71,598 were single adults.
THE WORD THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WON&#39;T USE WHEN IT COMES TO THE BORDER? &#39;CRISIS&#39;
Migrant children are arriving at the U.S. 
southern border
 at rates faster than they can be processed and transferred to sponsor homes, all while the 
Biden
 administration has repeatedly denied that there is a &#34;crisis&#34; at the border, a senior Customs and Border Protection official 
told Fox News

&#34;We are taking in more UACs than we can process,&#34; the CBP official said. &#34;I don&#39;t see how we keep this many kids when we can&#39;t find sponsors.&#34; The official spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The sister of 
North Korean leader,
 Kim Yo Jong, criticised ongoing military drills in South Korea and warned the new 
U.S. administration
 against &#34;causing a stink&#34; if it wants peace, state news reported on Tuesday.
The statement comes a day before America’s top diplomat and defence chief are due to arrive in Seoul for their first talks with South Korean counterparts.
&#34;We take this opportunity to warn the new U.S. administration trying hard to give off powder smell in our land,&#34; Kim said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA. &#34;If it wants to sleep in peace for coming four years, it had better refrain from causing a stink at its first step.&#34;
North Korea has so far rebuffed entreaties from the United States to engage in dialogue, the White House said on Monday, as a chill in relations that began under then-President Donald Trump has extended into Joe Biden’s presidency.
Leader Kim Jong Un had three high-profile summit meetings with Trump and exchanged a series of letters, but the nuclear-armed state ended talks and said it would not engage further unless the United States drops its hostile policies.
South Korean and American troops began a joint springtime military drill, which was limited to computer simulations because of the coronavirus risk as well as the ongoing efforts to engage with the North.
&#34;War drills and hostility can never go with dialogue and cooperation,&#34; said Kim Yo Jong, who has become a vocal critic of Seoul in state media dispatches.
She mocked South Korea for &#34;resorting to shrunken war games, now that they find themselves in the quagmire of political, economic and epidemic crisis.&#34;

The inter-Korean engagement that had improved in 2018 and is sought by South Korea &#34;won’t come easily again&#34; and North Korea will be watching to see if there is further provocations, she said.
North Korea would consider pulling out of an inter-Korean military agreement aimed at reducing tensions along their shared border, and would review whether to dissolve several organizations aimed at cooperation with the South, Kim said.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., argues that &#39;there&#39;s been more damage done in this administration in the first 100 days than thought possible in four years.&#39; 
Rep. Nancy Mace
, R-S.C., argued Tuesday on &#34;
America Reports
&#34; that Democrats reintroducing the Green New Deal &#34;is about the far left trying to change and reshape our 
economy
 and our country in their 
socialist
 vision.&#34;
Mace made the comments shortly after 
Sen. Ed Markey,
 D-Mass., and 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
 D-N.Y., reintroduced the Green New Deal during a news conference.
Ocasio-Cortez noted that the two also unveiled legislation 
more than two years ago
, now expanding that proposal. Ocasio-Cortez said during the news conference on Tuesday that the proposal &#34;creates a plan for 20 million union jobs in the United States of America&#34; to rebuild infrastructure and expand access to mass transit, among other things.  She noted that the legislation has 103 House cosponsors. 
The broader idea of a Green New Deal, once an idea on the fringe of the party, has picked up mainstream Democratic support -- a sign of the Democratic Party’s lurch to the left in recent years.
In fact, last month when 
President Biden
 released his 
sprawling proposal
 to rebuild the nation&#39;s crumbling infrastructure, it included pumping money into renewable energy and combating climate change. The 
$2.25 trillion measure 
will be funded largely by raising taxes on U.S. corporations.

Mace has also been a 
vocal critic 
of the infrastructure bill, saying in a 
Fox News op-ed
 that it is essentially the Green New Deal and incorporates a &#34;socialist wish list.&#34;
She noted that the infrastructure plan contains &#34;large swaths of the socialist ‘Green New Deal,’ which remains firmly planted on the brains and wish lists of socialists in the House and Senate - despite both Congress and voters rejecting the bill.&#34;
&#34;There&#39;s been more damage done in this administration in the first 100 days than thought possible in four years,&#34; she said on Tuesday. 
&#34;With trying to do a Green New Deal and a housing bill worth about $192 billion, this is on top of a wasteful infrastructure bill costing $2 trillion, almost half of which would be Green New Deal type of spending,&#34; Mace explained. 
&#34;I don’t know how you sell this to the American people,&#34; she added. &#34;This is not good for the American people.&#34;
Mace argued that instead of &#34;having the federal government in charge and subsidizing this every step of the way,&#34; if incentives are given to businesses in the private sector, &#34;together we can improve our environment and be greener.&#34; 
She stressed the importance of going about it in a bipartisan way.

&#34;But what we&#39;re seeing now is the continued power of the far left, the stranglehold they have over Capitol Hill,&#34; Mace said. &#34;This will not be done in a bipartisan way much like the infrastructure package, and it&#39;s sickening and sad because we had a real opportunity to lead our country out of a crisis and everything right now is so partisan.&#34;

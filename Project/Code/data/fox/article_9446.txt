New Hampshire
 state senator unaware he was unmuted during a remote hearing Wednesday called a female colleague a vulgar name, then apologized.

&#34;Nobody else can do anything. Right,&#34; said Sen. John Reagan, R-Deerfield, followed by the vulgarity.
As the meeting adjourned later, Reagan said, &#34;Apologies for my recorded outburst previously.&#34;
Carson, who thanked Reagan for the apology, did not respond to a request for further comment.
In an email to The Associated Press, Reagan called his remark &#34;an open mic zoom goof.&#34;
Senate President Chuck Morse, a Republican from Salem, called the comment &#34;inappropriate and disappointing.&#34;
&#34;I expect that all Senators will be respectful to their colleagues and the public while carrying out Senate business,&#34; he said in a statement.
Senate Democratic Leader Donna Soucey, of Manchester, said lawmakers &#34;should be held to the highest standards of respect and decorum.&#34;

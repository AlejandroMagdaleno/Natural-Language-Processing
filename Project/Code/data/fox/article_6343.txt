U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene drew loud cheers from a crowd in 
Ohio
 on Saturday night when she directed some barbs at a House colleague, U.S. Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
.
&#34;She’s not an American. She really doesn’t embrace our American ways,&#34; Greene claimed about the New York Democrat, who was actually born in New York City. 
&#34;You want to know why? She has something called the ‘
Green New Deal
,’&#34; Greene, a 
Georgia
 Republican, continued, referring to the package of climate initiatives that Ocasio-Cortez has proposed on Capitol Hill. The GOP has derided the plan as a costly job-killer.
Greene referred to the plan as being pitched by &#34;the little communist from 
New York City
.&#34;
Ocasio-Cortez must have been watching Greene’s appearance near Cleveland, which preceded a speech by former President Donald Trump, because the Democrat responded on Twitter to Greene’s &#34;little communist&#34; dig.

&#34;First of all,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez wrote, &#34;I’m taller than her.&#34;
Ocasio-Cortez stands at 5 feet, 6 inches tall, while Greene stands at 5 feet, 3 inches tall, according to internet accounts.
Later, Ocasio-Cortez reminded her Twitter followers that Saturday was the third anniversary of her 2018 upset win in a New York U.S. House primary, when she defeated incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Crowley, leading to victory in the general election later that year.
Greene and Ocasio-Cortez have clashed before. Some examples:
On April 21, Greene posted a photo of herself and Ocasio-Cortez on the House floor, amid Greene’s effort to get Ocasio-Cortez to agree to a debate about the Green New Deal.
&#34;After I finish reading all 14 pages, like we agreed, I’ll schedule time for our debate,&#34; Greene wrote.
On May 12, Greene confronted Ocasio-Cortez on Capitol Hill about why the Democrat allegedly supported &#34;terrorists and Antifa,&#34; 
The Washington Post reported
.
&#34;You don’t care about the American people,&#34; Greene alleged during the exchange, according to the report.
Ocasio-Cortez kept walking and said nothing in response to Greene but at one point she threw &#34;her hands in the air in an exasperated motion,&#34; according to the Post.

      U.S. Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., left, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., have frequently clashed since becoming U.S. House colleagues.
      
On May 13, Ocasio-Cortez 
told reporters
 about Greene, &#34;I used to work as a bartender. These are the kinds of people that I threw out of bars all the time.&#34;

On May 14, Ocasio-Cortez told a reporter that she believed Greene was obsessed with her and was &#34;deeply unwell, um, and clearly needs some help.&#34;
Earlier Saturday in Ohio, Greene arrived on the stage to a recording of &#34;Fortunate Son,&#34; by Creedence Clearwater Revival.
&#34;You guys are great. Oh, I love you Ohio, I love you,&#34; she said.
&#34;Now I always check when I go to speak to a crowd because I want to make sure I’m talking to smart people -- pretty important,&#34; she continued. &#34;Let me ask you all one great question: Who’s your president?&#34; 
The crowd erupted in cheers.

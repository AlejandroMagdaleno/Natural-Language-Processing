U.S. Rep. 
Madison Cawthorn
, R-N.C., last week defended having missed the most 
House 
votes of any freshman member of the chamber because of his 
honeymoon
. 
&#34;It just shows how exactly the Democrats feel about the nuclear family in America right now. I was doing the only thing that I find more important than my service here in Congress, and that was my service as a husband,&#34; Cawthorn told Real America’s Voice network on Thursday, according to The Washington Times. 
Cawthorn, 25, wed Cristina Bayardelle, an Instagram influencer, in a religious ceremony on April 3, the seven-year anniversary of the car crash that left him partially paralyzed. The couple previously held a civil ceremony in December, the Times reported.

The two then flew off to their honeymoon in Dubai.

reported. 
Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., had the worst vote record of any freshman Democrat, having missed 2.8% of votes. 
During his four-day honeymoon, Cawthorn was absent for 21 votes, the Times reported, citing nonprofit ProPublica. Some of the bills were sponsored by Republicans.

FOX News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel joins &#39;Fox Report&#39; with the latest on the pandemic.
A recall campaign to oust California 
Gov. Gavin Newsom
 is nearing its required threshold to qualify for a statewide ballot. 
Over the weekend, recall organizers said they have collected 1.2 million of the 1.5 million signatures needed by March 17 to qualify for a ballot.

Per state law, petition sponsors must gather the signatures of 12% of the voter turnout in

 previous statewide election, which is about 1,495,709 names.
Rescue California, one of two main groups organizing the campaign, said their goal is to collect 2 million signatures to account for the fact that many of the signatures will inevitably prove invalid. 
San Diego’s KUSI reported Saturday
 that California’s secretary of state has confirmed 84% of the signatures collected so far are valid.

 and its impact on the economy. 
&#34;It&#39;s absolutely gaining traction. We&#39;re getting petitions from not only Republicans but from Democrats and Independents,&#34; John Cox, Newsom&#39;s 2018 Republican challenger who recently launched an exploratory committee to challenge the governor again in 2022, told Fox News last week. &#34;This has just gone on too long -- the mismanagement that has accompanied this pandemic.&#34;

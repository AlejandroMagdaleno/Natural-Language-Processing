Pennsylvania parents fighting to reopen schools get their health questions answered.
Press secretary 
Jen Psaki 
on Wednesday said the White House believes vaccines for teachers are not a prerequisite to reopening schools – but instead, a recommended &#34;mitigation step.&#34;
Psaki’s comments come after Vice President Kamala Harris was asked during an interview on NBC’s &#34;Today&#34; whether the White House believed it was safe for teachers to return to the classroom without a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.
KAMALA HARRIS SAYS TEACHERS &#39;SHOULD BE A PRIORITY&#39; IN RECEIVING COVID-19 VACCINE
Harris said she and President Biden believe teachers should &#34;be a priority&#34; in terms of receiving the vaccine, but that it is a decision left up to the states.
During the White House press briefing Wednesday, Psaki, referring to vaccinating teachers, said &#34;neither the president nor the vice president believe that it is a requirement.&#34;
&#34;The CDC guidelines included a range of mitigation steps, including vaccinations, as recommendations,&#34; Psaki explained, adding that other steps included &#34;social distancing and the need for smaller class sizes.&#34;
&#34;At the same time, the president and vice president both believe teachers should be prioritized,&#34; she continued. &#34;That is up to the states to decide.&#34;
Psaki was pressed again on whether the White House would mandate the states to prioritize teachers for vaccinations.

&#34;We can provide federal guidelines,&#34; she said, adding that the White House works &#34;in close partnership with states to make recommendations of prioritization and they implement.&#34;
Psaki added that both Biden and Harris have used &#34;the power of the presidency and the power of the vice presidency&#34; to convey their position in the last 24 hours, which is that vaccinations for teachers are &#34;not a requirement to reopen schools, but we believe that teachers should be prioritized.&#34;
FAUCI TO AMERICANS: &#39;WHEN YOUR TURN TO GET VACCINATED COMES UP, GET VACCINATED&#39;
Psaki’s comments come after Harris on Wednesday morning appeared on NBC’s &#34;Today&#34; show and said the administration believes teachers &#34;should be a priority&#34; in receiving the 
coronavirus vaccine
 as parents and educators clash over whether it is safe for teachers to return to classrooms without inoculations against COVID-19.
&#34;Teachers should be a priority. Teachers should be a priority,&#34; Harris said. &#34;Teachers are critical to our children’s development, they should be able to teach in a safe place and expand the minds and the opportunities of our children, so, teachers should be a priority along with other front-line workers.&#34;
She added: &#34;We’re going to make them a priority.&#34;
When pressed on whether it was safe for teachers to return to the classroom without a vaccination, Harris said the administration thinks &#34;they should be a priority.&#34;
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO SPEND $1.6 BILLION TO BOOST CORONAVIRUS TESTING
&#34;And the states are making decisions individually about where they will be on the list of who gets vaccinated. I believe they should be a priority,&#34; she said. &#34;The president believes they should be a priority.&#34;
The back-and-forth over vaccinating educators comes as the White House on Wednesday announced that the U.S. is now averaging 1.7 million doses of 
COVID-19
 
vaccine
 administered daily – up from an average of 900,000 shots per day one month ago. The latest data reflects an increase of 200,000 doses from the week prior.
The Biden administration had set a goal to achieve 100 million vaccinations within the president&#39;s first 100 days in office, with current data reflecting a pace that would surpass that goal.
The White House also announced this week that the Biden administration is increasing its vaccine supply to states to 13.5 million doses per week – an increase from the 
10 million
 doses per week the White House had previously announced.

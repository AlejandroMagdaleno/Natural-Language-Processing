Fairfax County parent Asra Nomani reacts saying there is a &#39;war on parents&#39;
The 
Fairfax
 Democratic Committee appears to have organized the controversial event where 
Michelle Leete
 said &#34;let them die&#34; while its chair applauded that line, according to video of the event.
Fox News and other outlets reported on the event in which Leete, a member of the local NAACP chapter, prompted applause after she appeared to call for the deaths of critical race theory (CRT) opponents.
On its website, the Fairfax Democratic Committee posted a flyer for the a &#34;Rally in Support of Student Health and Public Education.&#34; The event description included the location of the speech – Luther Jackson Middle School – as well as the date and time, said anti-CRT activist Asra Nomani, who took the original footage of Leete&#39;s comments.
Nomani&#39;s own footage showed the party&#39;s chair, Bryan Graham, nodding his head and applauding after Leete&#39;s &#34;let them die&#34; line.

The committee&#39;s live stream also shows Graham – noticeable in a bright pink shirt – being introduced as a speaker.
The committee did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Graham did not respond when contacted via Twitter.
As Fox News previously noted, Leete used her speech to run through a litany of apparent political opponents before saying &#34;let them die.&#34;
&#34;Let&#39;s deny this off-key band of people that are anti-education, anti-teacher, anti-equity, anti-history, anti-racial … anti-opportunities, anti-help people, anti-diversity, [inaudible], anti-science, anti-change agent, anti-social justice, anti-health care, anti-worker, anti-LGBTQ+, anti-children, anti-health care, anti-worker, anti-environment, anti-admissions policy change, anti-inclusion, anti-live and let live – let them die!&#34;
According to 
The Washington Post,
 Leete said she intended to wish death on the various &#34;ideals&#34; from parents, not the parents themselves.

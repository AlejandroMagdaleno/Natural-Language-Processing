A third woman accuses N.Y. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment. Attorney Remi Spencer reacts.
New York
 State Assembly Majority Leader Crystal Peoples-Stokes on Tuesday said that if allegations of inappropriate behavior against 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo
 are true, he &#34;failed&#34; to hold himself to a high standard.
Three women have come forward in recent days accusing the Democratic governor of making unwanted advancements toward them, strengthening calls 
for Cuomo to resign
 following another scandal tied to his handling of nursing homes during the coronavirus pandemic.
&#34;With great power comes great responsibility,&#34; Peoples-Stokes said in a Tuesday statement posted to social media. &#34;As a longtime public servant, this quote is what I live by. It reminds me that in my position, I must hold myself to the highest standard. Gov. Cuomo is required to do the same.&#34;
She continued: &#34;If allegations of the past few days are true, he has failed to hold himself to this standard, and no one, including the governor, has the right to do such things with impunity. All workplace harassment allegations are to be taken seriously and should be thoroughly and independently investigated.&#34;

Peoples-Stokes added that she is confident in New York Attorney General Letitia James&#39; ability to &#34;find the truth for New Yorkers.&#34;
James recently announced that the governor&#39;s office sent a letter permitting her office to perform an independent investigation following allegations of inappropriate behavior.

Charlotte Bennett, a 25-year-old former staffer, claimed Cuomo talked about his willingness to have relationships with women in their 20s. Prior to Bennett&#39;s allegation surfacing, Cuomo aide Lindsey Boylan published a blog post accusing the governor of unwanted touching and kissing. Most recently, 33-year-old Anna Ruch has claimed that Cuomo asked to kiss her at a wedding in 2019, according to The New York Times.
Local New York journalist Lindsay Nielsen has also 
accused
 the Cuomo administration of &#34;incessant bullying,&#34; alleging that she received &#34;many accusatory and threatening phone calls&#34; in a Sunday statement.

A number of other local politicians and others with connections to Cuomo have 
accused
 the governor of bullying tactics on social media after New York Assemblyman Ron Kim spoke out in February about mistreatment from the governor. Kim alleged that Cuomo had threatened to &#34;destroy&#34; him in a spat over the state’s nursing home crisis.
Democratic politicians within the state have started calling for Cuomo&#39;s resignation after the accusations surfaced.

The &#39;Outnumbered&#39; panel slam Biden, Harris, Ocasio-Cortez for reactions to Chauvin verdict.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 gave 
President Biden
 a progressive thumbs up for his 100 days in office Friday night.

AOC&#39;S PLAN TO SAVE US POSTAL SERVICE NEVER GOT OFF THE GROUND
Ocasio-Cortez
 gave 
Biden
 her leftist seal of approval largely based on his actions in pushing through the $1.9 trillion 
COVID-19
 stimulus package, known as the American Rescue Plan.
She said his willingness to show flexibility in negotiations has been &#34;very impressive&#34; and led to the passage of &#34;progressive legislation.&#34;
&#34;It’s been good so far,&#34; the congresswoman said.
But the lefty firebrand said Biden’s handling of
 infrastructure legislation 
will be a &#34;key&#34; test on whether the president will continue to be bold or the American Rescue Plan turns out to be a &#34;one and done situation and we’re going smaller.&#34;
Ocasio-Cortez
 complained that Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan 
is inadequate
, particularly the provision that sets aside only $40 billion to renovate crumbling public housing.

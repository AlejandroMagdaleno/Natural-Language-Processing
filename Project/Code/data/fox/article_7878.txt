The Republican National Committee will air an ad during Tuesday night&#39;s Major League Baseball All-Star Game that claims political figures and corporations &#34;lied&#34; about 
Georgia
&#39;s new voting law, which led to 
MLB
 moving the game from Atlanta to Denver.
The game was originally set to take place at Truist Park, home of the Atlanta Braves, but MLB moved it to the Colorado Rockies&#39; Coors Field after Democrats, including President Biden, likened the law to Jim Crow. The RNC said it is putting seven figures into the ad buy.
GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE DEFENDS ELECTION REFORM LAWS
&#34;Democrats stole our All-Star Game to push their divisive political agenda. Politicians and corporations lied, while Black communities got hurt the most,&#34; Georgia&#39;s Rev. Melvin Everson says in the ad in a voiceover, which was released Monday. &#34;Even though a majority of Black voters support laws like voter ID. To Democrats it&#39;s just a game. But we’re the ones who got played.&#34;
The 
Washington Post
 awarded Biden a maximum four Pinocchios for his claims about Georgia&#39;s law, particularly his statement that the law &#34;ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over,&#34; when in reality the law keeps Election Day voting hours at 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Any changes to early voting hours would expand hours, not reduce them, the Post said.

MLB made the decision to move the All-Star Game after Biden told ESPN he supported the idea, and called the law &#34;Jim Crow on steroids.&#34;
&#34;The lies told by Democrat politicians and corporations about election integrity have real-life consequences, hurting Georgia families,&#34; Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. &#34;Democrats don’t care about the costs of their lies because their sole agenda is more power. The American people will hold Democrats accountable for their lies about election integrity because they know the security of our elections is too important.&#34;

President Biden gave his sharpest criticism of Cuomo during an ABC interview; FOX News&#39; Bryan Llenas on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Lindsey Boylan, a former aide for 
New York
 Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 who has accused him of sexual misconduct, said on Wednesday that she did not intend to take part in the state-led impeachment probe into claims against the Democratic governor.
In a series of tweets, Boylan slammed the investigation as a &#34;sham,&#34; calling out Speaker of the State Assembly Carl Heastie for failing to lead a transparent process.
The tweets follow the New York State Assembly’s announcement that it had selected Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP to help lead the investigation.
A spokesperson for Heastie did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment.
CUOMO SEIZES ON COMMON GROUND WITH BIDEN, AGREES SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED
 
Boylan’s tweets were first reported by 
The New York Post
.
Boylan’s attorney, Jill Basinger, told the publication that she was &#34;fully cooperating&#34; with the attorney general’s investigation and was interviewed last week in connection with that probe.
&#34;We are pleased with the scope of the investigation and the thoughtfulness and thoroughness of their questioning,&#34; Basinger said.
Boylan was the first of seven women to publicly bring forward claims of sexual misconduct against Cuomo. She alleged that the governor attempted to kiss her in his office, which he has denied.
As 
reported by Fox News on Tuesday
, state lawmakers indicated that the probe into Cuomo could go beyond sexual harassment claims – which have been brought forward by seven women – to potentially also include treatment of nursing home patients during the pandemic and reports about possible structural problems with a massive infrastructure project.

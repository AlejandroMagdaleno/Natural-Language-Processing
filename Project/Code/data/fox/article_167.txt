Former HHS chief of staff Brian Harrison and FOX News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier discuss on &#39;FOX News @ Night&#39;
The Alabama Republican Party on Saturday presented former 
President Donald Trump
 with a framed copy of a resolution, passed unanimously by the party, that declares him &#34;one of the greatest and most effective&#34; presidents in U.S. history.
&#34;The resolution, basically, it just talks about the greatness of Donald J. Trump, how he made America great again and I hope other states will follow suit,&#34; Perry Hooper Jr., a former state representative and a member of the state party’s executive committee, told Fox News in an interview ahead of the reception.

The resolution, which passed unanimously in the party, calls Trump &#34;one of the greatest and most effective presidents in the 245-year history of this Republic&#34; and lists his achievements in office.
&#34;It’s just recognizing him for all the great things he has done for America for bringing back American manufacturing, cutting taxes, creating best economy ever, building up our military,&#34; Hooper said.

TRUMP USES CPAC SPEECH TO TEAR INTO BIDEN ON BORDER CRISIS, SAYS HE WON&#39;T CREATE NEW PARTY
Hooper, who has served as the 2016 Trump campaign’s Alabama co-chairman  and was in the Trump campaign’s finance committee in 2020, said he would go a step further and say Trump was the best president ever.
&#34;He&#39;s just done so many great things,&#34; he said. &#34;I was a kid when Reagan was elected and I thought nobody would top the great things Ronald Reagan did but then comes along Donald J Trump and in my opinion, he’s not just one of the great presidents, he is the greatest president we’ve had in America.&#34;
The resolution is the latest sign of strong support for Trump from the conservative and Republican Party base. 
Trump comfortably won the 
Conservative Political  Action Conference (CPAC)
 straw poll in Florida last month on who attendees would vote for if they ran in the 2024 presidential primary.

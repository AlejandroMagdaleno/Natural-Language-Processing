On &#39;America&#39;s Newsroom,&#39; Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte blasts the Biden administration for what he calls a &#39;devastating&#39; decision to halt the Keystone Pipeline.
Montana Governor Greg Gianforte said the 
Biden administratio
n is pandering to &#34;radical environmentalists&#34; with the decision to shut down construction of the 
Keystone XL Pipeline
 and encouraged him to reverse his decision.
&#34;It is a misguided decision,&#34; he told &#34;
America&#39;s Newsroom
&#34; on Friday. &#34;President Biden is really pandering to these radical environmentalists. 
Gianforte said the economic impact on Montana was &#34;massive.&#34;
AS BIDEN&#39;S KEYSTONE XL ORDER SPARKS JOB LOSSES, CLIMATE ADVISER SAYS, &#39;WE&#39;RE NOT ASKING FOR SACRIFICE&#39;
&#34;Not only do we lose hundreds of jobs, and this is the most economical and environmentally sensitive best way to get crude oil to market, but this Keystone Xl pipeline is a lifeline for rural Montana,&#34; he said. &#34;It would have generated over $100 million a year in taxes to help us pay for schools, law enforcement, infrastructure. This is devastating. President Biden needs to reverse his decision.&#34;
Biden signed an order to cancel the pipeline&#39;s construction permit in the name of battling climate change, but his decision 
drew criticism
 from both sides of the U.S.-Canadian border for killing thousands of jobs. The pipeline would carry oil in tar sands from Canada to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Gianforte also slammed Biden White House climate envoy 
John Kerry
 for claiming workers who might lose work in the oil and gas industry could find employment creating solar panels.
&#34;We had crews on the ground burying pipe, building substations, capital was being invested,&#34; Gianforte said. 
&#34;When this executive order came out, we had people packing up their lunch pails and going home. They were not going to another job.&#34;

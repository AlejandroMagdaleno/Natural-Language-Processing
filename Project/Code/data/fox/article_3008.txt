Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren on the Biden administration supporting the Olympic hammer thrower&#39;s protest.
Rep. 
Dan Crenshaw
, R-Texas, doubled down on his criticism of U.S. Olympic hammer thrower 
Gwen Berry
, saying Wednesday that if someone is going to represent 
America
 on the world stage, they &#34;should like the USA.&#34;

The Texas congressman said it was &#34;funny&#34; how he became the &#34;face of this entire thing&#34; after his interview and that he believes he pointed out something he &#34;thought was pretty obvious.&#34;
&#34;If you&#39;re going to represent the Team USA, you should, well, you should like the USA, and that the mere notion of supporting the United States shouldn&#39;t offend you, if you&#39;re going to be on Team USA after all,&#34; Crenshaw 
said
 to Hewitt.
&#34;Now I think a lot of people would agree with that,&#34; Crenshaw said. &#34;But next thing I know, I was trending on Twitter.&#34;

&#34;I mean, it really has gotten to that. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an overstatement,&#34; the congressman said. &#34;I don&#39;t think I’m throwing out red meat here.&#34;
Crenshaw had previously called for Berry to be &#34;removed from the team&#34; over the athlete&#39;s controversial snubbing of the anthem, which she claimed was a &#34;setup.&#34;

Berry, 31, earned her spot on the Olympic team for a second time with a bronze medal performance over the weekend but much of the attention was on her protest of the national anthem. 
&#34;I feel like it was a setup, and they did it on purpose,&#34; Berry said of the timing of the anthem. &#34;I was pissed, to be honest.&#34;

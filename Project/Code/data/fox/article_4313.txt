 Gov. Kevin Stitt clapped back against animal rights activists by holding a burger cookout Wednesday evening near a pro-vegan PETA billboard that criticized him for supporting the meat 
industry
. 
The animal rights group put up the Oklahoma City billboard near the Capitol, calling out Stitt for declaring the week of March 22 &#34;
Meat All Week
&#34; throughout the state to encourage Oklahomans to feast on meat and poultry.

The Republican governor responded by 
tweeting a picture
 of the billboard, saying: &#34;Looks like a great spot to grill some burgers.&#34;
Stitt followed through and hosted a cookout Wednesday evening to grill up burgers, hotdogs and steak underneath the pro-vegan billboard. Pictures show the governor wearing a &#34;Beef&#34; apron as he manned the grill and talked up support for farmers and ranchers.

&#34;While Governor Polis in Colorado declared today a &#39;meatless holiday,&#39; next week in Oklahoma is &#39;MEAT ALL WEEK,&#39;&#34; Stitt said in a 
Facebook post
 on March 20. &#34;Do what you can to buy and eat protein. I can’t wait to have a big juicy ribeye -- and I will always stand with our farmer and ranchers!&#34;

PETA didn&#39;t think too kindly of the cookout near their billboard, which they called a &#34;smelly, dead-animal barbecue.&#34;
In response, the animal rights activists said they&#39;ll be sending Stitt a gift.

&#34;PETA is sending the governor a back brace, since he must be in agony from all the bowing and scraping he has to do to keep his meat-industry backers happy,&#34; PETA President Ingrid Newkirk said in a statement. &#34;His constituents who end up in critical care with cancer, heart disease, strokes, and other conditions associated with meat consumption deserve everyone’s sympathy.&#34;

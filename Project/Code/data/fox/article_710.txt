Top Biden adviser Anita Dunn is leaving her position at the White House.
Dunn&#39;s final official day at the White House will be Thursday, Fox News has confirmed. She will now transition to playing a key role as an outside adviser to 
President Joe Biden
, an arrangement similar to the one she had with former 
President Barack Obama
.
Dunn had always intended to have her stint at the White House last only a few months but stayed a little bit longer than expected as she attempted to assist the president in pushing his economic agenda through Congress.
With the Senate this week voting to pass Biden&#39;s infrastructure bill, Dunn will finally transition to her role as a close confidant to the president.
TOP WH ADVISER ANITA DUNN DODGING PUBLIC ETHICS DISCLOSURE
&#34;Anita is a backbone of Team Biden and her leadership was critical not just to the campaign but to our first 200 days in the White House,&#34; White House communications director Kate Bedingfield 
told Axios
. &#34;She&#39;s someone all of us turn to as a sounding board and for guidance — and although she may wish we’d leave her in peace, that definitely won’t change!&#34;
Dunn served as senior campaign adviser and White House communications director under Obama, and has long been one of the most well-known Democratic political operatives. She will now transition back to SKDK, a well-known political consulting firm she helped found.
Dunn recently generated controversy when it was reported that she had not publicly disclosed her finances, a typical requirement of presidential appointees.
The White House argued that Dunn was actually a special government employee, a class of employee who can avoid disclosing finances if they have a salary less than $132,500 and work under 130 days.
There were 205 calendar days between Inauguration Day and Thursday, while 147 of those would have been considered &#34;work days&#34; when eliminating weekends and federal holidays.
Anita Dunn is a &#34;special government employee required to file OGE Form 450,&#34; which is a confidential financial disclosure form, a White House official said.

The New York Times reported last month that the White House views Dunn&#39;s departure &#34;as a brief moment to breathe before she starts to plan the president’s re-election, which so far he has indicated he intends to wage.&#34;

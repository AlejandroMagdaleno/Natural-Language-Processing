Fox News&#39; Griff Jenkins reports from the Rio Grande Valley, widely seen as the epicenter of the migrant crisis. 
While 
Customs and Border Protection
 officials are seeing migrants trying to enter the 
U.S.
 in numbers that have skyrocketed since last year, the House Appropriations Committee is looking to cut the agency&#39;s net discretionary funding by nearly a billion dollars.
The committee&#39;s newly released draft of their Homeland Security funding bill would provide $14.11 billion in net discretionary funding, down $927 million from fiscal year 2021. 
SOUTH DAKOTA GOV. KRISTI NOEM SENDS 50 NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO TEXAS TO HELP TACKLE BORDER CRISIS
&#34;President Biden’s border crisis is getting worse, and rather than address the problem, House Democrats’ answer is to cut resources from our immigration enforcement agencies,&#34; a representative from House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said in a statement.
A 
summary
 of the bill issued by the committee advertises that the bill &#34;[p]rovides no funding for additional Border Patrol Agents or border barriers&#34; and &#34;[r]escinds $2.06 billion from prior year appropriations for border barrier construction.&#34;
FLORIDA GOV. DESANTIS SENDING LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL TO AID TEXAS, ARIZONA WITH BORDER CRISIS
This comes as CBP released its 
latest statistics
 from May of this year. CBP said that officials have encountered 180,034 people trying to cross at the southwestern border, up 1% from April. Numbers of family units and unaccompanied minors from Northern Triangle countries have decreased since last month, at rates of 31% and 23%, respectively.
The bill&#39;s funding amount for CBP is $456 million below what the White House requested. The committee did note, however, a number of provisions that were above that request, such as funding for border technology, port of entry technology, and services for CBP personnel such as tuition assistance, childcare service, and on-site mental health clinicians. The bill also provides for &#34;migrant processing improvements,&#34; aimed at better protecting migrants who are in custody.

Sen. 
Ted Cruz
, R-Texas, said he is &#34;dismayed&#34; by a 
Biden
 nominee&#39;s refusal to commit to blacklisting Chinese telecommunications company Huawei as former President Donald Trump had done out of concern that the company was a security threat.
Cruz asked Biden&#39;s commerce secretary nominee Gina Raimondo about Huawei at her confirmation hearing Tuesday. Throughout the hearing, Raimondo espoused a tough position against 
China
, but Cruz expressed disappointment that she did not explicitly state that companies currently on the Entities List will remain there.
RUSSIA, CHINA BENEFITING FROM A BIDEN PRESIDENCY, NOT AMERICA: REP. MCCARTHY
&#34;I am dismayed with Governor Raimondo&#39;s and other Biden administration staffers’ responses on Huawei, Cruz said in a statement to Fox News. &#34;It already looks like Team Biden is rushing to embrace the worst elements of the Chinese Communist Party. Huawei is a global espionage operation masquerading as a technology company and the Senate should use every tool at our disposal to keep Huawei on the Entities List.&#34;
During the hearing, Cruz had first asked generally if the companies currently on the list would remain there if Raimondo is confirmed. After she only said that she would &#34;commit to working with you on that&#34; while recognizing the list is a &#34;powerful tool,&#34; Cruz specifically asked about Huawei.
&#34;Can you commit that Huawei will remain on the list?&#34; Cruz asked.

&#34;I will commit that once, should I be confirmed and I am there, I will review the policy, consult with you, consult with industry, consult with out allies, and make an assessment as to what’s best for American national and economic security,&#34; Raimondo replied.

Cruz responded by claiming that there was &#34;chatter in Washington that the Biden administration is contemplating going easy on China and removing companies from the Entities List.&#34; He said he hopes this does not come to pass, &#34;because I think that would be profoundly contrary to the national security interest of the United States.&#34;

At other points in the hearing, Raimondo had 
called out China
 for &#34;unfair trade practices,&#34; accusing them of engaging in &#34;anti-competitive&#34; and &#34;coercive&#34; practices, as well &#34;atrocious human rights abuses.&#34; She said that the U.S. needed to take &#34;aggressive&#34; measures, including the entities list, to combat Chinese practices that she believes hurt American workers.
&#34;Whether it&#39;s the entities list, or tariffs, or countervailing duties, I intend to use all those tools to the fullest extent possible to level the playing field for the American worker,&#34; she said. &#34;I believe in free trade but fair trade.&#34;

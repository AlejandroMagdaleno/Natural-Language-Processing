Fox News Primetime host sounds off after toddlers dropped from border wall
In his 
&#34;Fox News Primetime&#34;
 monologue on Tuesday, host Mark Steyn lamented the exponential increase in human smuggling into the United States as the 
Biden
 administration fails to 
secure the southern border
.
Steyn said that under the current president, the 
Department of Homeland Security
 is &#34;laughably misnamed&#34; and that the chaos and undoing of previously stringent policies have opened a horrifying &#34;express-lane&#34; for human traffickers.
&#34;I&#39;m an immigrant to this great Republic,&#34; he said, specifying that he was a legal immigrant from 
Canada
.
&#34;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not an undocumented immigrant. I&#39;m the other kind -- and boy, I wouldn&#39;t make that mistake again: Years in the system, the arbitrary whelms of the bureaucracy, the paperwork...&#34;
Steyn also remarked of a Filipino national serving as a priest in 
Vermont
 reportedly being deported because his temporary visa expired before the bureaucracy was able to process his Green Card application.
&#34;Fortunately under the laughably misnamed Department of Homeland Security there&#39;s now an express check-in -- Just get a human trafficker to throw you into the country,&#34; he said, pointing to video of 
Mexican traffickers dropping toddlers
 off of a 14-foot section of border wall constructed under President 
Donald Trump
. 
&#34;It&#39;s time for your toddler to start crawling -- through the desert,&#34; he said.
Steyn said that for some reason, people on the left see a lax immgration system like the one being instituted as &#34;compassionate.&#34;
&#34;[They] think the government being industrial-scale enablers of some of the most evil people on the planet is progressive and compassionate. It&#39;s not,&#34; he said.
&#34;There is nothing kind about incentivizing human trafficking, which, by the way, is merely a synonym for slavery and the same people who want to tear down the statue if the guy&#39;s family had a plantation 300 years ago are all cool with the global trade in human beings of the 21st century.&#34;
TEXAS, LOUISIANA SUE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION FOR ‘REFUSING’ TO TAKE CRIMINAL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
&#34;So, Joe Biden or whoever has got his hand waggling that moth-eaten sock-puppet is consciously 
enriching these cartels
 and ensuring that they can expand their operations including more fentanyl to kill Americans and some would-be jihadists now and then.&#34;
Steyn said the U.S. is witnessing what is becoming a &#34;lopsided business partnership between America and coyotes at a time of global pandemic -- when almost every national border on the planet, including the northern U.S. Border is closed down.&#34;
Canada is allowing very few people into the country by land or air from the U.S. -- and has instituted a nonetheless stringent exception for Alaskans trying to travel by land to and from the rest of the continental United States.

&#34;[T]he southern border has been entirely dissolved because, apparently, it&#39;s the one place on Earth where the COVID just evaporates -- no danger there.&#34;
He remarked that the people centuries ago in what is now Germany were apparently not woke enough when they forged the Peace of Westphalia, which established the contemporary idea of borders.
&#34;What do those guys know? They are not all caring and sensitive like you NPR and &#39;New York Times&#39; types who know that every time a kid gets tossed into America, a coyote gets his wings.&#34;

Fox News’ David Spunt discusses president&#39;s high court plans on ‘Special Report.’
President Biden
 alleged Wednesday that some working-class industries are facing hiring shortages because of insufficient wages.
&#34;A lot of people who worked as waiters and waitresses decided that they don’t want to do that anymore because there’s other opportunities at higher wages,&#34; Biden said. &#34;There’s not much distinction between not going back to work at a restaurant and not going back to work at a factory, so people are looking to change opportunities, change what they’re doing.&#34;
Biden spoke in response to a question during a CNN town hall from a restaurateur asking about hiring deficiencies nationwide. He said he thinks it is a matter of employees &#34;looking to make more money and bargain.&#34;

&#34;I think your business and the tourist business is really going to be in a bind for a little while,&#34; he added. 
Biden suggested that former waiters and waitresses who made $7 to $8 an hour were ditching their previous occupations for positions that pay $15 an hour. 
&#34;If you make less than $15 an hour working 40 days a week you’re making below the poverty level,&#34; the president said. 
Waiters make tips and can often earn far more than $15 per hour.
Biden addressed the argument posed by GOP lawmakers who have suggested hiring shortages persist in the U.S. because federal social stimulus programs delivered throughout the pandemic have continued. 
&#34;We’re ending all those things keeping people back from going to work, etc,&#34; Biden said

The president added, though, that he does not believe there is evidence to support the claim that unemployment benefits have kept people from applying to restaurant jobs.
&#34;I see no evidence it has any serious impact on it,&#34; Biden said.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., calls out Dr. Fauci over double mask mandate post-vaccine.
Sen. 
Rand Paul,
 R-Ky., ripped Dr. Anthony 
Fauci
 on Friday for engaging in political &#34;theater,&#34; by asking Americans to continue wearing masks after receiving the 
coronavirus
 
vaccine.
 Paul appeared on 
&#34;Fox &amp; Friends&#34;
 Friday, a day after another heated exchange with Fauci at a COVID hearing in the Senate
RAND PAUL, FAUCI SPAR OVER WHETHER WEARING MASKS AFTER COVID VACCINE IS &#39;JUST THEATER&#39;
RAND PAUL: 
&#34;We’ve had 90 million vaccines in our country, about 40 to 50 million people have been vaccinated and the question is, do they have immunity? Well, we’ve always believed that- that’s the science of vaccines is that when you get an infection or you get the vaccination you develop immunity and yet [Dr. Fauci] keep moving the goalposts and saying well you might get this variant from South Africa...
And my point to him is, show us the evidence. Show us the scientific evidence that people who have already had COVID or people that have already gotten the vaccine are getting it again... 
But it’s not true, it’s all conjecture. He says we might get it, therefore we need to wear the mask for another year... 
It’s a ridiculous notion not based on science, and what he is doing is theater and it goes against the science of vaccines. Dr. Fauci has immunity, he can’t get it again but he’s wearing a mask because it’s one of his noble lies to convince everybody to wear masks, but it’s not true.&#34;

Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty on questioning Secretary of State Antony Blinken during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the Afghanistan withdrawal.
Michigan state Rep. Jewell Jones, D-Inkster, had his bond revoked by a judge and was taken into custody on Tuesday after he violated bond terms for a third time.
Jones was previously out on bond after an alleged drunken driving crash occurred earlier this year in Livingston County.
&#34;I am one to believe in graduated sanctions and not jailing this man until sentencing, but I am going to revoke bond at this time,&#34; said Livingston County Circuit Judge Michael Hatty, according to the 
Detroit News

Jones, who is 26-years-old, has an alcohol tether, which detects the presence of alcohol in a person&#39;s sweat. According to court records, Jones&#39; tether showed alcohol in his system at three different times on September 3. In addition, he also tampered with the tether on September 6.
&#34;This defendant’s actions — from his conduct during the charged crimes through each of the three bond violations — show that he believes that, as a person who writes our laws, that he is above our laws,&#34; said assistant prosecutor Christina Richards. &#34;There is also a very strong public perception that the defendant is getting special treatment because of his position.&#34;
According to Michigan State Police 
reports
, Jones was arrested on April 6 when his Chevy Tahoe weaved in and out of lanes on Interstate 96 before he pulled off into a ditch. His blood alcohol content was 0.19, more than twice the legal limit of 0.08, the report noted.

During his arrest, Jones 
told
 officers that their actions are &#34;not going to be good for you,&#34; adding that he would &#34;call Governor [Gretchen] Whitmer right now,&#34; according to the police report.
Jones also referred to Whitmer as a &#34;
homie
&#34; when officers attempted to capture his intake photo without a face mask. &#34;You know what? Big Gretch is the homie. When she finds out about this, she might be a little upset about the treatment,&#34; Jones said. &#34;She&#39;s very serious about the pandemic so I&#39;m just wondering if I can wear the mask.&#34;
Under Judge Hatty&#39;s order, a pretrial conference with Jones is scheduled for Friday.

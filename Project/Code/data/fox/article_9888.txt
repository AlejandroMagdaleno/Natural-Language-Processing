Gov. Ron DeSantis issues statewide order for Floridians to stay-at-home amid COVID-19 pandemic.
Florida
 Gov. Ron DeSantis, who saw his profile rise within the Republican Party during the 
coronavirus
 pandemic due to his opposition to locking down his state, will be the opening speaker of the 2021 
Conservative Political Action Conference
 (CPAC) on Friday. 
DeSantis, who was born on Sept. 14, 1978, was elected Florida&#39;s governor in 2018. His refusal to completely lock down his state in 2020 during the pandemic -- which has even included efforts to block local coronavirus restrictions that are more strict than at the state level -- is part of what led CPAC to select Orlando, Fla., for its venue this weekend. 
&#34;It was a very intentional decision to go to Florida,&#34; American Conservative Union President Matt Schlapp told Fox News.

&#34;We considered other states, Tennessee, Georgia Florida, Texas ... Florida just seems like the obvious place,&#34; he said. &#34;You know, the city of Orlando obviously has got the infrastructure to take a big conference. I mean, Las Vegas would have too, but ... the governor there just makes it impossible, is basically making it impossible for any business to be open, whereas the governor of Florida is doing just the opposite.&#34;
Fittingly, DeSantis&#39; CPAC welcome speech on Friday is titled &#34;Florida Welcomes CPAC: Open for Business.&#34;

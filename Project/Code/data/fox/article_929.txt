Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., joins ‘Sunday Morning Futures’ to discuss the investigation into Capitol Hill security.
President Biden&#39;s
 $1.9 trillion 
coronavirus
 relief bill is a Trojan horse that the 
Democrat
 will use as a slush fund to buy votes over the next four years, U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes said Sunday.
Nunes, R-Calif., told &#34;
Sunday Morning Futures
&#34; anchor Maria Bartiromo that the proposal, 
which the U.S. House of Representatives passed with a vote early Saturday
, has &#34;very little to do with COVID relief.&#34;
DEMOCRATS RELEASE PLAN TO BRING BACK EARMARKS
&#34;This is a slush fund in order to buy votes that Biden can use over the next four years,&#34; Nunes said. &#34;It&#39;s a Trojan horse with $2 trillion in it so they can build things like a goofy high-speed rail that they haven&#39;t even completed.&#34;
Nunes was referring to a high-speed rail project in California that was granted billions of dollars over a decade ago under an Obama-era stimulus program during the 2009 recession.
He likened that project to 
the current proposal’s inclusion of more than $100 million
 for an underground rail project in Silicon Valley that would expand the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) underneath San Jose.
&#34;I think the American people know that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with COVID relief,&#34; Nunes said.
The House passed its version of the relief proposal with a vote of 219-212 around 2 a.m. Saturday.
No Republicans backed the bill and two Democrats – U.S. Reps. Jared Golden of Maine and Kurt Schrader of Oregon – voted against their party’s plan.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., argues that the majority of the proposed package addresses ‘non-COVID’ goals.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has derided the nearly $2 trillion proposal as &#34;Pelosi’s Payoff Bill,&#34; noting that &#34;the amount of money that actually goes to defeating the virus is less than 9 percent.&#34;

The proposal contains a third $1,400 stimulus check for Americans earning less than $75,000 annually, increases jobless benefits to $400 a week through the end of August, expands the child tax credit to up to $3,600 per child, includes $350 billion for state and local government funding and allocates $170 billion for K-12 schools and higher education institutions to cover reopening costs.
Tucked into the House bill was also the Democrat’s plan to gradually increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025 – an effort many Republicans rejected.

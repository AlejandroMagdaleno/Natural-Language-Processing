Pennsylvania State Rep. Mike Jones and restaurant owner Matt DeRose provide insight on ‘Fox and Friends Weekend.’
President Biden
 has drawn backlash for providing a pessimistic view of his administration&#39;s ability to combat the 
coronavirus
 pandemic in the near future.
Biden&#39;s campaign featured harsh criticisms of former President Trump&#39;s approach to COVID-19, and in his first speech as president-elect he said his administration&#39;s work &#34;begins with getting COVID under control.&#34; On Friday, however, he indicated that the trajectory of the pandemic can&#39;t be changed in the coming months, no matter what Americans do.
BIDEN SAYS &#39;NOTHING WE CAN DO&#39; TO CHANGE PANDEMIC &#39;TRAJECTORY&#39; IN COMING MONTHS
&#34;If we fail to act, there will be a wave of evictions and foreclosures in the coming months as this pandemic rages on, because there&#39;s nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months,&#34; Biden said.
The idea that nothing will change the pandemic drew confusion and ire from figures in politics and the media.
&#34;Haven&#39;t we been told for months that restrictions and mandates were necessary to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months?&#34; former Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, a libertarian, tweeted.
Fox News contributor and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, criticized Biden for his fatalist sentiment.
&#34;Already giving up,&#34; Chaffetz tweeted. &#34;Banner headlines in all major media outlets? Nope. Most will bury this but it is a stunning admission. Biden says &#39;nothing we can do&#39; to change pandemic &#39;trajectory&#39; in coming months.&#34;
National Review&#39;s David Harsanyi said the idea that there was nothing that could be done was &#34;the opposite&#34; of what Biden said during his campaign.
On Sunday, Biden&#39;s nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra tried to clarify the president&#39;s message.

&#34;I believe President Biden made it very clear, the plane is in a nosedive, and we gotta pull it up. And you’re not going to do that overnight,&#34; Becerra told &#34;
State of the Union
&#34; host Dana Bash on CNN. &#34;But we&#39;re gonna pull it up, we have to pull it up. Failure&#39;s not an option here, and so we will.&#34;
When asked if that means he believes the administration can indeed change the pandemic&#39;s trajectory, Becerra reiterated that it would not happen &#34;overnight,&#34; but said that progress is possible if people work together.

&#34;We&#39;ve got to make sure we&#39;re coordinated,&#34; he said. &#34;We can&#39;t just tell the states, &#39;Here&#39;s some PPE, some masks, here&#39;s some vaccines, now go do it.&#39; No, no. When we hand them over, we stay with them and provide resources to make it happen.&#34;
Becerra then claimed that the simple act of everyone wearing face masks would be enough to make an impact.

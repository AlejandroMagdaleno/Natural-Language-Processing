Sen. Tom Cotton points to Disney&#39;s controversial decision to film in China&#39;s Xinjiang Province amid human rights issues.
Sen. Tom Cotton
, R-Ark., called out Disney on Monday for their decision to slap 
content warnings on episodes of &#34;The Muppet Show&#34;
 on the 
Disney+
 streaming service after the company&#39;s previous work in 
China&#39;s controversial Xinjiang Province
.
&#34;The Muppet Show,&#34; which first aired in 1976, was released on Disney+ Friday, with &#34;offensive content&#34; warnings ahead of select episodes.
&#34;This program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures,&#34; the disclaimer reads. &#34;These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now. Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.&#34;

,&#34; Sen. Cotton called the decision &#34;a total Mickey Mouse move&#34; after the company&#39;s controversial choice to film live-action remake &#34;Mulan&#34; in China&#39;s Xinjiang Province, where Beijing is accused of human rights abuses against Uighur Muslim people.
&#34;Just last year they thanked an agency of the Chinese Communist Party that is responsible for concentration camps and genocide in Xinjiang Province, China, for helping them film a movie,&#34; Cotton said.
&#34;It is outrageous and appalling.&#34; 
Cotton also referenced 
comments Disney CEO Bob Iger made in 2019
 when he said filming in the state of Georgia would be &#34;very difficult&#34; due to a controversial abortion bill.

&#34;The Georgia legislature wanted to protect unborn children, yet [Disney] is perfectly willing to work with Chinese communists who are responsible for genocide against their own people,&#34; Cotton said. &#34;It&#39;s really appalling.&#34;

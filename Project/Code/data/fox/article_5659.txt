Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer joins &#39;America&#39;s Newsroom&#39; and compares Trump and Biden immigration agendas.
The 
Biden
 administration is set to open a new tented 
immigration
 facility in 
Texas
 amid a surge of migrants coming to the border. 
The facility is opening in Eagle Pass, Texas, in the Del Rio sector, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to Fox News. The soft-sided facility is being set up in addition to a similar 185,000-square-foot site in Donna, Texas, that was opened at the beginning of the month.
Customs and Border Protection said it was building the facility to &#34;help accommodate migrants in our custody.&#34; 
The number of migrants reaching the U.S. border from Latin America has increased since President Biden&#39;s inauguration as some Trump administration border policies have been changed and eased.

&#39;Special Report&#39; All-Star panel weighs in on border facility conditions at the US-Mexico border
TEGUCIGALPA - Several hundred 
Hondurans
 set off on Tuesday for the Guatemalan border, seeking to reach the United States to 
escape the impact

The group was the second large caravan to set out from Honduras this year, on the heels of catastrophic flooding in November from hurricanes Eta and Iota, which battered an economy that was already seriously struggling.
Central Americans have made up the bulk of a sharp increase in migrants trying to reach the United States via Mexico in recent weeks, putting pressure on U.S. President Joe Biden. The crisis includes the arrival of thousands of unaccompanied children who have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border.

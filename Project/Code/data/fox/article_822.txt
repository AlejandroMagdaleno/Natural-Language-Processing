Tom Homan tells &#39;Life, Liberty &amp;amp; Levin&#39; Biden intentionally neutered ICE
President Biden
 &#34;sold out&#34; America to progressives in order to be elected president, former 
Immigration
 and Customs 
Enforcement
 (ICE) Acting Director 
Tom Homan
 told &#34;
Life, Liberty &amp; Levin
&#34; in an interview airing Sunday.
Host Mark Levin posited to Homan that the Biden administration&#39;s strategy in dealing with the surge of migrants at the 
U.S.-Mexico border
 is &#34;overwhelm the system, break the system, then blame the system and take control.&#34;
&#34;You&#39;re correct,&#34; Homan responded. &#34;The Biden administration is still trying to blame President Trump for what&#39;s going on the border right now. They&#39;re ignoring the fact that -- I don&#39;t care if you love President Trump or hate him -- you cannot deny the fact that he gave us the most secure border in my career, which is almost thirty-five years.
&#34;I started in 1984 as a Border Patrol agent,&#34; Homan added. &#34;I spent my entire career on border enforcement, immigration enforcement, and President Trump got it right. He had unprecedented success on that border.&#34;

Homan went on to explain that Trump &#34;understood that 90% of the Central Americans that come to our border to claim asylum never get relief from U.S. courts. They simply don&#39;t qualify. That data&#39;s easily available on the Department of Justice website; anybody can look at it.
&#34;I doubt President Biden has looked at it or [DHS Secretary] Alejandro Mayorkas has looked at it, because if they did, then they&#39;re facilitating immigration fraud on the border.&#34;
Homan recalled that during Barack Obama&#39;s second term, when Biden was vice president and Mayorkas was deputy homeland security secretary, &#34;we built detention facilities, thousands of them. We held people long enough to see a judge. We let ICE remove them and we took away the enticements.&#34;
Now, however, &#34;Joe Biden has sold out this country to the progressive left to win an election,&#34; Homan claimed. &#34;He&#39;s a different person ... Alejandro Mayorkas is a different person.&#34;

As a result, Homan concluded, migrants detained at the border are being released &#34;as soon as they can, within three days. ICE has been decapitated. They lost 90% of their authority. They&#39;re not executing judges&#39; orders, and we keep throwing out more enticements.
&#34;This isn&#39;t incompetence. This is by design. This is an open borders agenda that we all knew was coming.&#34;

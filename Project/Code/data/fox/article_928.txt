White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki tells ‘Fox News Sunday’ the Biden administration is ‘committed’ to allowing media into Border Patrol facilities. 
President Biden
 will have &#34;more to say&#34; in April about his 
coronavirus
 recovery plan focused on issues like health care and women leaving the workforce after pushing a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package earlier this month, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Sunday.
&#34;When the president advocated for the American Rescue Plan, he talked about this being two stages: rescue then recovery. What the American people will hear from him this week, is part of his plan, the first step of his plan toward recovery which will include an investment in infrastructure,&#34; Psaki told &#34;Fox News Sunday.&#34;

It&#39;s a crisis right now, the number of women who have left the workplace,&#34; she continued. &#34;The total package, we&#39;re still working out.&#34;
That package and the Democrats&#39; expected infrastructure bill will be &#34;two separate proposals,&#34; Psaki said.

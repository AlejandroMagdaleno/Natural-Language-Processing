White House

In an interview that will air in full Tuesday at 11 a.m. ET on 
&#34;The Faulkner Focus,&#34;
 McEnany told host Harris Faulkner that she expected a peaceful protest to take place as Congress met in a joint session to tally the Electoral College votes. However, she watched in shock as attendees stormed the Capitol building in search of lawmakers. 
&#34;I think at the beginning of the day, before everyone went to the rally, everyone was expecting peace,&#34; McEnany recalled. &#34;We had been to hundreds of rallies -- I&#39;ve probably been to hundreds at this point, certainly many dozens -- and they were nothing but peaceful events, and we expected that day to be the same.
&#34;And then as those events transpired, it was disbelief, shock, somber, sad, horrified by the violence, and it was a very hard, difficult day in the White House, there is no doubt.&#34;

Bygones appeared to be bygones at the 
White House
 Friday, with first lady Jill Biden getting chummy with Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 — days after a forthcoming 
book 
revealed Biden said Harris should &#34;go f–k&#34; herself for attacking her husband during the Democratic primaries.
The pair shared a maskless hug prior to a ceremony at which Biden presented the Medal of Honor to Army Col. Ralph Puckett, a 94-year-old Korean War veteran.
At the first Democratic debate in June 2019, Harris memorably scolded Biden for his opposition to federally mandated busing, invoking her own experience with busing and school desegregation while growing up in Oakland, Calif.
The following week, according to Edward-Isaac Dovere’s book &#34;Battle for the Soul: Inside the Democrats’ Campaigns to Defeat Trump,&#34; Jill Biden ripped Harris in a conference call with supporters.

published by Politico
.
The first lady notably did not deny that she made the remark, telling a reporter Thursday: &#34;That was two years ago. We’ve moved on from that.&#34;
&#34;That was two years ago. We’ve moved on from that.&#34;
The same excerpt revealed that during a commercial break following the clash between Biden and Harris, the then-former vice president muttered to fellow candidate Pete Buttigieg: &#34;Well, that was some f–king bulls–t.&#34;

The Bidens got the last laugh, however, as Harris dropped out of the race that December, before the first nominating contests. Joe Biden overcame poor finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire to scoop the Democratic nomination and win the presidency from Donald Trump.

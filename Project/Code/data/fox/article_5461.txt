Host Laura Ingraham sounds off on &#39;The Ingraham Angle&#39;
Activists from Arizona attempted to target Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, 
D-Ariz.
, at the Boston Marathon on Monday but the senator&#39;s broken foot prevented her participation, her office told Fox News.
The Arizona Working Families Party and the Sunrise Movement&#39;s Tempe chapter shared a photo of activists holding up signs urging Sinema to deliver &#34;green jobs now,&#34; &#34;care jobs now,&#34; and to &#34;be brave, fight for us.&#34; They intended to urge her to support 
President Biden
&#39;s $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, also called the Build Back Better bill.
&#34;We&#39;re here at the #Boston Marathon with @SunriseTempe and others from AZ asking @SenatorSinema to stop running from her constituents and start listening!&#34; the Arizona Working Families Party tweeted. #StopRunningSinema &amp; pass the full Build Back Better plan NOW!&#34;
The protest came after activists from the Green New Deal Network, a coalition of 15 organizations, announced that they planned on &#34;bird-dogging&#34; Sinema during the marathon, according to 
The Boston Globe
. 
Yet the Green New Deal Network told Fox News its activists had &#34;no luck with a sighting of Sen. Sinema&#34; at the marathon.
A spokesperson for the senator told Fox News that Sinema had to skip out on running the race.
&#34;While Kyrsten qualified for and attended the race, she could not run because of her continued recovery from a broken foot,&#34; her office said in a statement.
Last week, activists approached Sinema at the airport and on an airplane, urging her to support the Build Back Better bill. Other activists even followed her from a classroom at Arizona State University, where she teaches, to a bathroom there. They continued hounding her while she was in the stall and later when she emerged to wash her hands.
TEAM BIDEN CLINGS TO RECONCILIATION BILL ZERO-COST CLAIM SHOT DOWN BY WASHINGTON POST FACT-CHECKERS
Sinema has expressed her opposition to the Build Back Better bill, which Democrats have often paired with a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. Sinema and her colleague 
Sen. Joe Manchin
, D-W.Va., have balked at the $3.5 trillion sticker price, which The Wall Street Journal 
editorial board
 has insisted is a low estimate of the bill&#39;s true cost of $5 trillion. Biden and his advisers, meanwhile, 
have insisted
 that the cost is &#34;zero&#34; because they pledge to pay for the $3.5 trillion with tax increases on the wealthy and corporations.
Activists approaching Manchin&#39;s houseboat aboard kayaks also 
accosted him
. 
Biden 
addressed
 the confrontations against the senators last week, noting that neither senator has Secret Service protection.
&#34;I don’t think they’re appropriate tactics, but it happens to everybody,&#34; Biden said.

&#34;The only people it doesn’t happen to are the people who have Secret Service standing around them,&#34; Biden added. &#34;So, it’s part of the process.&#34;
This story has been updated with statements from the Green New Deal Network and Sinema&#39;s office, reflecting that the senator did not run in the Boston Marathon.

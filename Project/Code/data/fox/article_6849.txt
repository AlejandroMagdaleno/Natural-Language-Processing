Video of Navy radar from 2019 shows as many as 14 objects swarming the USS Omaha off the coast of San Diego, California; reaction on ‘Outnumbered.’
Former President Obama in an interview published Thursday said he &#34;absolutely&#34; wants to know more about 
footage
 showing purported 
unidentified flying objects
 from the Navy.
Obama was answering a question from New York Times journalist Ezra Klein, who hosts &#34;The Ezra Klein Show&#34; 
podcast
. Klein brought up the Navy&#39;s apparent UFO sightings that filmmaker Jeremy Corbell recently leaked to the media, sparking questions about what the Pentagon knows that the everyday American may not.
&#34;It’s interesting,&#34; the former president said of the UFO footage. &#34;It wouldn’t change my politics at all. Because my entire politics is premised on the fact that we are these tiny organisms on this little speck floating in the middle of space.&#34;
NEW FOOTAGE SHOWS UFOS SWARMING NAVY SHIP
Obama recalled a former science adviser telling him, &#34;There are more stars in the known universe than there are grains of sand on the planet Earth&#34; – a point he makes to cheer up staff.
He went onto explain how the prospect of aliens might be unifying for humanity.
&#34;…My politics has always been premised on the notion that the differences we have on this planet are real. They’re profound, and they cause enormous tragedy as well as joy,&#34; he said. &#34;But we’re just a bunch of humans with doubts and confusion. We do the best we can. And the best thing we can do is treat each other better, because we’re all we got.&#34;
ASTROPHYICIST EXPLAINS WHY UFO VIDEOS FAIL TO IMPRESS HIM
The former president added that he hopes the knowledge of aliens &#34;would solidify people’s sense that what we have in common is a little more important.&#34;
&#34;But no doubt, there would be immediate arguments about, well, we need to spend a lot more money on weapons systems to defend ourselves,&#34; he said. &#34;And new religions would pop up, and who knows what kind of arguments we’d get into. We’re good at manufacturing arguments for each other.&#34;
Corbell, the filmmaker who released the footage to the media, told Fox News&#39; &#34;America Reports&#34; last week that the Pentagon confirmed the videos showing UFOs swarming Navy ships in 2019 as &#34;authentic Navy footage.&#34;

&#34;This is corroborative, censored data that shows and supports the idea that I reported on for the last two months [in] releasing videos, that our Navy warships were swarmed by ‘unidentifieds’ – by UFOs,&#34; he said. &#34;They were never retrieved and we weren&#39;t able to capture them; it&#39;s a real issue.&#34;
Corbell said he leaked the videos in advance of an expected Pentagon report on UFOs and how the military views and is or isn&#39;t dealing with them.

A spokesperson for 
California
 Gov. 
Gavin Newsom’s
 potential gubernatorial challenger wants Twitter to know his boss responds to interview requests and isn’t trying to break major news on 
TikTok
 – in contrast with the incumbent, according to some critics.
&#34;The view from the podium of @Kevin_Faulconer’s very well attended press conference on Tuesday, where he answered every question, then went to do one-on-one interviews with dozens of California journalists,&#34; wrote Matt Shupe, a spokesman for Faulconer. &#34;Dramatic contrast in accessibility and transparency to @CAgovernor.&#34;
Shupe shared the image in response to another tweet from Politico writer Carla Marinucci criticizing Newsom for allowing only a single reporter at a press conference earlier in the week.

&#34;[There is] so much momentum right now in California because people want a change, and I just launched my campaign this week,&#34; Faulconer told Trey Gowdy on &#34;Fox News Primetime&#34; Friday. &#34;We are talking about a California comeback.&#34;

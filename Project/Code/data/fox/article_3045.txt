The D.C. Metropolitan 
Police Department
 is investigating what appears to be a noose hung near a Church, according to a statement and police report obtained by Fox News on Friday night.

DC Councilmember Charles Allen posted a photo of the hanging rope, calling it a &#34;despicable symbol&#34; and an &#34;act of hate.&#34;

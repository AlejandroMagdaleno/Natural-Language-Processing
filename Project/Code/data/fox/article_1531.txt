Rep. Jake Ellzey, R-TX, recalls his service in Afghanistan, reacts to withdrawal on &#39;America Reports&#39;
Conservatives and veterans attacked 
President Biden
 for appearing to look at his watch during a ceremony for the 13 U.S. service members killed in an 
ISIS-K suicide bombing
 near the 
Kabul airport in Afghanistan
 last week. 
Biden met with the families of the troops killed in the attack, and he also attended the &#34;dignified transfer&#34; of the fallen troops, a military ritual of receiving the remains of those killed in foreign combat, while at Dover Air Force Base on Sunday.
During the event, Biden appeared to look down at his watch, sparking criticism from conservatives.
&#34;It&#39;s true. Joe Biden checked his watch during the dignified transfer of the servicemembers killing in Afghanistan at the airport. You can see him jerk his left hand to pull the watch out from under his sleeve, then look down at it,&#34; Nicholas Fondacaro, a news analyst for the Media Research Center, tweeted with a video.

Former White House doctor Ronny Jackson said he was &#34;disgusted&#34; by Biden&#39;s appearing to look at his watch.
&#34;Apparently our Commander-in-Chief has better things to do than honor the 13 service members who died on his watch? I’m DISGUSTED! God bless these heroes and their loved ones. They deserved better,&#34; 
Jackson tweeted

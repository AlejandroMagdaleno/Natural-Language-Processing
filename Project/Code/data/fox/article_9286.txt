FOX News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the details from Capitol Hill on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Former President Trump will not testify in his Senate impeachment trial, Fox News has learned. 
&#34;The president will not testify in an unconstitutional proceeding,&#34; Trump senior adviser Jason Miller told Fox News Thursday. 
The former president&#39;s legal team fired back at impeachment manager Jamie Raskin&#39;s request Thursday for the former president to testify as part of the Senate impeachment trial, calling it a &#34;public relations stunt&#34; and saying they &#34;cannot prove&#34; the allegations against him.
The comments come after House impeachment managers requested that Trump provide testimony under oath either before or during the Senate impeachment trial about &#34;his conduct&#34; on Jan. 6.
The president&#39;s legal team did not say, one way or the other, whether the president would testify. 
&#34;We are in receipt of your latest public relations stunt,&#34; Trump&#39;s attorneys Bruce Castor and David Schoen wrote. &#34;As you certainly know, there is no such thing as a negative inference in this unconstitutional proceeding.&#34; 
&#34;Your letter only confirms what is known to everyone: you cannot prove your allegations against the 45th President of the United States, who is now a private citizen,&#34; they continued.
They added: &#34;The use of our Constitution to bring a purported impeachment proceeding is much too serious to try to play these games.&#34; 
The request from impeachment managers came after Trump’s legal team filed an answer to the Article of Impeachment denying what managers call &#34;incontrovertible facts about the president’s conduct on and leading up to&#34; the Capitol riots.
Trump’s legal team responded saying that &#34;the 45th President of the United States performed admirably in his role as president, at all times doing what he thought was in the best interests the American people.&#34;
Lead impeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., on Thursday wrote a letter to Trump, saying he has &#34;attempted to put critical facts at issue notwithstanding the clear and overwhelming evidence of your constitutional offense.&#34;
&#34;In light of your disputing these factual allegations, I write to invite you to provide testimony under oath, either before or during the Senate impeachment trial, concerning your conduct on January 6, 2021,&#34; Raskin wrote. &#34;We would propose that you provide your testimony (of course including cross-examination) as early as Monday, February 8, 2021, and not later than Thursday, February 11, 2021. We would be pleased to arrange such testimony at a mutually convenient time and place.&#34;
Raskin added: &#34;If you decline this invitation, we reserve any and all rights, including the right to establish at trial that your refusal to testify supports a strong adverse inference regarding your actions (and inaction) on January 6, 2021.&#34;
Raskin requested Trump respond by Friday, Feb. 5 at 5 p.m.
The House voted Jan. 13 to impeach Trump 232 to 197, with 10 Republicans joining all Democrats. The Senate impeachment trial will begin Feb. 9. 
Trump&#39;s legal team&#39;s answer denies that Trump violated his oath of office while also saying that he was protected by the First Amendment in response to claims he incited an insurrection.

New Mexico&#39;s
 governor signed a law Wednesday eliminating qualified immunity for 
law enforcement
, making it the third state to do so amid a growing debate about police misconduct in the U.S.
&#34;[G]ood public servants work tirelessly every single day to protect those rights, to ensure them, to safeguard New Mexicans,&#34; read a statement from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
&#34;But when violations do occur, we as Americans know too well that the victims are disproportionately people of color, and that there are too often roadblocks to fighting for those inalienable rights in a court of law.&#34;

Fraternal Order of Police Executive Director Jim Pasco said: &#34;It&#39;s going to have a chilling effect on the kind of appropriately aggressive policing that has helped drive crime rates to historic lows.&#34;

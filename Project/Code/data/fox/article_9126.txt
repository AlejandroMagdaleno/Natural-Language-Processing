Since the 
inauguration
 of 
President Joe Biden
 on Jan. 20, the adult children of former President 
Donald Trump
 have enjoyed a boost in 
Twitter
 followers. 
The 
social media
 giant banned the former president from the platform indefinitely just 12 days prior to the inauguration due to 
what it said
 was &#34;the risk of further incitement of violence&#34; following the 
Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol
. 
REPUBLICANS SLAM TWITTER&#39;S CROWDSOURCED FACT-CHECKING PROGRAM &#39;BIRDWATCH&#39;: &#39;WHAT COULD GO WRONG?&#39;
In the days after 
Trump was banned
, many 
conservatives
 
flocked to
 similar message-sharing apps like 
Parler
. However, 
Google
 and 
Apple
 soon 
removed the app from their app stores
 on Jan. 9, saying Parler has &#34;not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of&#34; threats of &#34;violence and illegal activity&#34; to people’s safety.
Though some have turned to lesser-known apps like 
MeWe and Rumble
, Twitter still has 
more than 330 million
 users. 
Since Trump and former first lady 
Melania Trump
 boarded Air Force One en route to 
Palm Beach International Airport
 almost a week ago, 
Ivanka Trump
, Tiffany Trump, and 
Donald Trump Jr.
 have all acquired 
thousands of new followers
.

According to social media tracking firm Social Blade, between Jan. 20 and Jan. 26, Donald Trump Jr. gained 
more than 46,100 followers
, Ivanka Trump gained 
more than 27,100 followers
, and Tiffany Trump 
gained just over 5,100
.
While all of their accounts had sustained relatively minor losses on Tuesday, 
only Eric Trump
&#39;s account is shown to be heading in a continued downward trajectory. 
Social Blade shows that his follower count had taken a hit for more than nine consecutive days before a rise of 98 new followers on Jan. 23.
Although his brother&#39;s account has risen incrementally to now 
more than 6.6 million followers
, Donald Trump Jr. reportedly also saw his numbers decrease on Tuesday. 
According to the site, Ivanka Trump&#39;s numbers are currently falling as well -- though she has the most 
at more than 10.3 million
.
Comparatively, Tiffany Trump has fewer than 1 million Twitter followers -- at 
more than 886,800
 -- and even her numbers are shown falling. 
Line graphs that accompany their Twitter statistics show steep drops in &#34;Monthly Gained Followers&#34; starting around November of last year.

While it remains unclear if a purported 
conservative &#34;exodus&#34;
 from Twitter and these analytics are linked, it is notable that Twitter has 
enforced and regulated content
 more stringently this month -- taking a hardline stance where it was previously more reserved.

 @ClarkCoSheriff
 deputy was shot in the head near Portland (in Vancouver, Wash.) overnight and killed,&#34; journalist Andy Ngo tweeted Saturday along with screenshots of tweets he claimed were linked to Antifa. &#34;The suspect remains at large. Antifa accounts have been celebrating on Twitter in response.&#34;
WHAT IS ANTIFA, THE FAR-LEFT GROUP TIED TO VIOLENT PROTESTS?
 
The accounts posted by Ngo show users with Twitter bios using terminology such as &#34;ACAB&#34;, which stands for &#34;all cops are bastards,&#34; and responding to the news of the deceased deputy with mocking comments 
such as
, &#34;Cheers, I’ll drink to that.&#34;
Another user reacted to the news with &#34;TAKBIR,&#34; which refers to the phrase &#34;Allahu akbar,&#34; Arabic for &#34;God is great.&#34; Another user with the Antifa logo as its profile photo celebrated the deputy&#39;s death by writing, &#34;I&#39;ll bet his pig family is crying.&#34;

Calls to defund the police, a move promoted by prominent Democrats nationwide, were also seen in several of the bios and tweets.
The deputy, later identified by authorities as Deputy Jeremy Brown, 46, was 
shot during a standoff
 on Friday night and died later at a hospital, authorities said. Two suspects were reportedly in custody in connection with the killing.

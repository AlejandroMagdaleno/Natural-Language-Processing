Dozens of activists 
protesting
 fossil fuel projects were arrested Thursday in 
Washington, D.C.
, after they staged a sit-in at the Interior Department, a move that led to &#34;multiple injuries&#34; and at least one law enforcement officer being transported to a hospital.
Demanding that 
President Biden
 declare climate change an emergency, People vs. Fossil Fuels, the group responsible for the protest, 
organized
 a week-long series of demonstrations against the president as he approves different fossil fuel projects.

Following the protest, Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz released a statement through a series of tweets.
&#34;Early this afternoon, a group of protestors entered the Stewart Lee Udall Main Interior Building,&#34; Schwartz wrote. &#34;Federal Protective Service personnel responded to the area to mitigate the situation. Multiple injuries were sustained by security personnel, and one officer has been transported to a nearby hospital. Medics representing both the Department and the protesters were present.&#34;
Schwartz also noted that Interior Secretary Deb Haaland was not in Washington during the protest and insisted that leadership at the department &#34;believes strongly in respecting and upholding the right to 
free speech
 and peaceful protest.&#34;
According to video footage from The Washington Post&#39;s Ellie Silverman, activists could be seen climbing up doors and pushing officers back as they tried to force their way into the Interior Department.
Andy Ngô, a conservative journalist who often covers events related to 
Antifa
, shared one of Silverman&#39;s videos. He described the scene at the federal building as &#34;reminiscent of 
Jan. 6
,&#34; noting that officers were forced to draw their stun guns as &#34;extreme environmentalist protesters&#34; attempted to make their way inside.
Event organizers 
alleged
 that &#34;police tased and hit multiple people with batons&#34; and &#34;55 people were arrested and taken away to DC Metro police stations.&#34;
&#34;Police acted aggressively with the water protectors and indigenous leaders, tasing at least two people and hitting others with batons,&#34; the group claimed. &#34;An independent indigenous media person was assaulted by the police and had his equipment broken.&#34;

White House
 press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that 
President Biden
 supports his son 
Hunter&#39;s
 recently announced book, which will be published in April and focus on his history of substance abuse. 
&#34;Beautiful Things&#34; was acquired in the fall of 2019, the Associated Press reported and will focus on Hunter Biden&#39;s struggles with substance abuse. The younger Biden&#39;s finances are currently under investigation by the Department of Justice. 
HUNTER BIDEN TO RELEASE MEMOIR &#39;BEAUTIFUL THINGS&#39; IN APRIL FOCUSING ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE
&#34;We admire our son Hunter&#39;s strength and courage to talk openly about his addiction so that others may see themselves in his journey and find hope,&#34; Psaki said, reading a statement from the president and first lady Jill Biden, written in their personal capacity as his parents. &#34;This is a personal book about his own personal journey.&#34;

Psaki did not answer a question about whether the book will be subject to any pre-publication clearance review. Similar processes have raised high-profile questions about the contents of books published by former Trump administration officials, including former Trump national security adviser John Bolton. 
Hunter Biden&#39;s book will be published by Simon &amp; Schuster, the same publishing house that 
dropped
 Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., from a book deal over Hawley&#39;s objection to the certification of electoral votes from Pennsylvania. The protest of the votes led to a pro-Trump mob attacking the U.S. Capitol.

&#34;In his harrowing and compulsively readable memoir, Hunter Biden proves again that anybody — even the son of a United States President — can take a ride on the pink horse down nightmare alley,&#34; author Stephen King wrote of &#34;Beautiful Things&#34; in a blurb. &#34;Biden remembers it all and tells it all with a bravery that is both heartbreaking and quite gorgeous. He starts with a question: Where&#39;s Hunter? The answer is he&#39;s in this book, the good, the bad, and the beautiful.&#34;
In a snippet released by Gallery Books, a division of Simon &amp; Schuster, Hunter Biden writes, &#34;I come from a family forged by tragedies and bound by a remarkable, unbreakable love.&#34;

Republicans criticize partisan task force&#39;s security recommendations; FOX News&#39; Jennifer Griffin on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Senate GOP Leader 
Mitch McConnell
 said the fortified security at the Capitol two months after the 
Jan. 6 riot
 is &#34;overdone,&#34; and he compared the militarization in Washington, D.C., to Afghanistan. 
&#34;I&#39;m extremely uncomfortable with the fact that my constituents can&#39;t come to the Capitol,&#34; McConnell, R-Ky., said Wednesday during a news conference. &#34;With all this razor wire around the complex, it reminds me of my last visit to Kabul. This is the Capitol of the United States of America.&#34;
McConnell last visited war-weary Afghanistan in October 2015.
The enhanced security has been a mainstay at the Capitol in the aftermath of the 
Jan. 6 riot
, when pro-President Trump supporters attacked the complex and sought to stop Congress from certifying President Biden&#39;s Electoral College win.

Access to the Capitol grounds has been severely restricted, with new fencing surrounding the complex and National Guard troops stationed throughout.

&#34;I think we&#39;ve overdone it,&#34; McConnell said. &#34;I just checked earlier this morning [and] there are no serious threats against the Capitol. I think we&#39;re way overreacting to the current need.&#34;
McConnell said some security upgrades are probably necessary after the riot, but the level of fortification that is currently deployed is an overreaction based on the current threat level.

&#34;It looks terrible to have the beacon of our democracy surrounded by razor wire and National Guard troops,&#34; McConnell said. 
PENTAGON TO EXTEND NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS AT US CAPITOL
The comments from the top Senate GOP leader come as a group of House Republicans Tuesday raised similar concerns about the fencing and troops.
Rep. 
Carlos Gimenez
, R-Fla., was among the 17 GOP members who authored a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demanding answers on the security. Gimenez called the fencing &#34;overkill&#34; and he believes the extraordinary security measures remain up &#34;for political reasons and not really safety reasons.&#34;

Still, the Pentagon plans to approve the extension of the National Guard troops stationed at the U.S. Capitol for another two months, a senior defense official told Fox News this week.
The announcement followed a request from Capitol Police that 2,200 National Guard troops remain behind to assist with security concerns.
Fox News confirmed that roughly 1,700 guardsmen will continue to serve at the Capitol – a security force reduced from the 5,000 troops currently deployed in Washington, D.C.
There have been various security reviews underway since the Jan. 6 riot.

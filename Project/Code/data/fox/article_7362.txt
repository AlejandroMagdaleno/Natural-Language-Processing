White House press secretary 
Jen Psaki
 on Tuesday said 
President Biden
 is not weighing in on former President Donald Trump’s Senate 
impeachment 
trial because &#34;he’s not a pundit,&#34; while maintaining that he will not watch the proceedings.
During the White House press briefing Tuesday, Psaki was repeatedly pressed by reporters for commentary on behalf of the president regarding his predecessor’s second Senate impeachment trial — which began amid the briefing.
WHO ARE THE DEMOCRATIC TRUMP IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS?
&#34;He’s not a pundit,&#34; Psaki said. &#34;He’s not going to opine on the back-and-forth arguments, nor is he watching them.&#34;
Psaki maintained that Biden has conveyed that Trump’s &#34;words and his actions and of course the events of Jan. 6 were a threat to our democracy.&#34;
&#34;He ran against him because he was concerned that former President Trump was unfit for office, in part, because of his past history of invoking violence around the country,&#34; Psaki said. &#34;President Trump—former President Trump—is not here because President Biden defeated him.&#34;

She added that now, Biden’s &#34;focus is on delivering on his promises to the American people.&#34;
Psaki, on Monday, said Biden would &#34;not spend too much time&#34; watching the impeachment proceedings, and maintained that he would leave the &#34;pace, process and mechanics&#34; of the trial up to the Senate.
Trump’s second Senate impeachment trial began on Tuesday, after the House on Jan. 13 voted for a second time to impeach him—this time on charges of inciting an insurrection ahead of and during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6.

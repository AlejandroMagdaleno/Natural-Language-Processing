Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk and FOX News contributor Leo Terrell join &#39;Justice with Judge Jeanine&#39;
Jalina Porter, who has been named deputy spokesperson for the 
U.S. State Department
 under 
President Biden
, once wrote that the largest threat to U.S. national security may be a domestic one.
In a 2016 Facebook post, Porter wrote that U.S. cops posed the largest national security threat, greater than that of both Russian hackers and ISIS, because of killings of Black Americans.
&#34;The largest threat to U.S. national security are U.S. cops,&#34; Porter said, as reported by 
The Washington Free Beacon
. &#34;Not ISIS, not Russian hackers, not anyone or anything else.&#34;
&#34;If ya’ll don’t wake up and rise up to this truth, the genocide against Blacks in America will continue until we are near extinct,&#34; Porter said. &#34;That’s not the world I seek to live in or create for myself and those around me.&#34;
Porter’s comments, according to the publication, were made in September 2016 – shortly after a video was released of an unarmed Black man, Terence Crutcher, being shot by police in Tulsa, Okla.
In a statement on Tuesday, Porter said: &#34;Comments I made five years ago on my personal Facebook account as a private citizen were in response to the uncomfortable – and deeply painful – truth of race-based violence in America that has continued ever since.&#34;
She added: &#34;The pain I expressed was real. Nevertheless, I should’ve chosen words that were less passionate and spur-of-the moment, as well as more constructive. I, of course, know well that not all law enforcement officers pose a threat to our community. Today, I am proud to stand as the State Department’s first Black woman Deputy Spokesperson, a position that affords me an opportunity to be part of the ongoing conversation regarding nationwide equity and inclusion, as we work to enhance the power of America’s example overseas.&#34;

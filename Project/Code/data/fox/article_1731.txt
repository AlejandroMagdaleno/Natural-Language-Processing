The 
White House
 recruited 
social media
 comedian Benny Drama for another digital push to convince the 
COVID-19
 
vaccine
-hesitant population to get the jab.
The video, posted to Instagram on Monday, casts Benito Skinner – better known by his stage name Benny Drama – as a young, hip White House intern named Kooper who works for press secretary Jen Psaki. 
Kooper shows a compilation of &#34;a day in the life&#34; shots of an intern, which is filmed in the White House. Psaki also features in small, brief sketches, including a moment when she smiles after hearing Kooper on the phone telling someone &#34;we need to get shots in arms.&#34; 
Psaki also notes in the video that &#34;we’ve vaccinated 160 million Americans,&#34; which Kooper says he’s getting down &#34;right here&#34; while pointing to his head and texting on his phone.

The video also references popstar Olivia Rodrigo, who 
visited the White House last month
 in an effort to promote COVID-19 youth vaccination. Rodrigo spoke during a press briefing on July 14, saying she was &#34;in awe&#34; of the work President Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci have done. 
&#34;It’s important to have conversations with friends and family members, including all communities, to get vaccinated and actually get to a vaccination site, which you can do more easily than ever before given how many sites we have and how easy it is to find them at vaccines.gov,&#34; Rodrigo told reporters. 
COVID-19 SYMPTOMS: WHAT TO LOOK FOR
The new video appears to try and play to the younger crowd, but it raised eyebrows for some, who questioned the video&#39;s target audience. Geoffrey Ingersoll of the Daily Caller 
tweeted
, &#34;I bet this video is influencing red county residents to get vaccinated in droves.&#34; 
On Instagram, many praised the video, proudly quoting back, &#34;It’s called initiative!&#34; – Kooper’s reply to Psaki when she notes in the video that she never asked him to make a nail salon appointment for her.

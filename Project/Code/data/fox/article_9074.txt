Gen. Mark Milley,
 chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, fired back at 
GOP lawmakers
 who questioned the military’s interest in studying critical race theory on Wednesday during a tense exchange at a House Armed Services Committee hearing.
Milley’s response followed a question from Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who asked top military officials to clarify the Defense Department’s approach to critical race theory. Gaetz and Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., expressed concern about discussions regarding critical race theory and &#34;white rage&#34; at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.
In response, Milley argued it was important for military cadets and officers &#34;to be open-minded and be widely read&#34; about concepts across the ideological spectrum. He also referenced the need to study the root causes of the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol amid a broader effort in the Defense Department to address extremism.
&#34;I&#39;ve read Mao Zedong, I&#39;ve read Karl Marx, I&#39;ve read Lenin. That doesn&#39;t make me a communist,&#34; Milley said. &#34;So what is wrong with understanding, having some situational understanding about the country for which we are here to defend? And I personally find it offensive that we are accusing the United States military, our general officers, our commissioned, non-commissioned officers of being, quote, ‘woke’ or something else, because we&#39;re studying some theories that are out there.&#34;
WALTZ SLAMS West Point ‘WHITE RAGE’ INSTRUCTION: ENEMY&#39;S AMMO ‘DOESN’T CARE ABOUT RACE, POLITICS&#39;
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordered a one-day stand down to address extremism last February, roughly one month after the Capitol riot. Gaetz claimed his sources within the military felt the stand-down was counterproductive to efforts to promote unity among military service members.
Gaetz addressed his question on critical race theory to Austin. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., yielded a portion of her time later in the hearing so that Milley could respond.
Austin also delivered a forceful response to Gaetz’s concerns.

&#34;I don’t know what the issue of critical race theory is and what the relevance [is] here with the department. We do not teach critical race theory. We do not embrace critical race theory and I think that’s a spurious conversation. We are focused on extremist behaviors and not ideology, not people’s thoughts, not political orientation. Behaviors is what we’re focused on.&#34;
Earlier this month, Waltz sent a letter to West Point demanding the academy stop teaching critical race theory, which he called &#34;divisive.&#34;

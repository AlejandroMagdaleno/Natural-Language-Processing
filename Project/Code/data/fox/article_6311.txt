Progressive &#39;squad member&#39; says Trump is both an arsonist and a fireman; Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo responds in &#39;Seen and Unseen.&#39;
The moderate 
Democrats
 who condemned Rep. Ilhan Omar over her comments apparently comparing the United States and 
Israel
 to Hamas say they are happy she issued a clarification Thursday but still &#34;frustrated&#34; about her longer record of making allegedly 
anti-Semitic
 remarks. 
Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., Elaine Luria, D-Va., and Brad Schneider, D-Ill., all signed onto the statement by a group of House Democrats saying comments from Omar, D-Minn., &#34;equating the United States and Israel to Hamas… at best discredits one’s intended argument and at worst reflects deep-seated prejudice.&#34; They expressed varying degrees of forgiveness for Omar Thursday and Friday after she met their demand to revisit her statement. 
&#34;There&#39;s a long history of comments here that I have found unacceptable and deeply concerning and this just adds to the record. So am I satisfied? I&#39;m just really frustrated by the continued series of comments targeted at the U.S.-Israel relationship,&#34; Gottheimer told Fox News when asked if he was &#34;satisfied&#34; with Omar&#39;s clarification. 
Omar issued a tweet Monday about &#34;unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban.&#34; But she partially walked back the statement Thursday, saying there is &#34;not a moral comparison between Hamas and the Taliban and the U.S. and Israel. &#34;

&#34;I was glad that she actually took the time to offer an explanation,&#34; Gottheimer said. But he said he disagreed with the premise of a tweet from Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., that said &#34;House Democratic leadership should be ashamed of its relentless, exclusive tone policing of Congresswomen of color.&#34;
&#34;I think every member of Congress has to be responsible for what they say,&#34; Gottheimer said. &#34;The comment was posted on social media. The comment was pretty clear in Ms. Omar&#39;s questioning of Secretary Blinken… people make mistakes, they have to clarify them.&#34;
Schneider appeared to have his concerns assuaged more easily than Gottheimer. He issued a statement Thursday quickly accepting Omar&#39;s clarification. 
&#34;Democracies should never be lumped in with terrorists. I am pleased @Ilhan heard our concerns about her tweet, issued a clarification, and agrees with our point,&#34; Schneider said. &#34;I hope all can avoid such offhanded statements in the future as we work together to support American jobs &amp; families.&#34;
That was very similar to a statement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other Democrats in House leadership which condemned comparisons between the U.S. and terrorist groups but accepted Omar&#39;s updated comments. 
Pelosi Friday further said she has no interest in taking disciplinary action against Omar despite calls from some Republicans to remove her from the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
&#34;I think that she clarified her remarks and that was, we accepted that and she, she, she has a point that she wanted to make and she has a right to make that point. There was some unease about how it was interpreted,&#34; Pelosi said. 
Luria, who is the Vice Chair of the House Armed Services Committee, expressed strong objections about Omar&#39;s comments in a CNN interview Friday but said she hopes Democrats can &#34;turn the page&#34; from the highly divisive episode.

&#34;Words matter. And these comments… that conflated the U.S., U.S. military, U.S., troops with the Taliban and Hamas are unacceptable and I thought it was very important to speak out against that especially as someone who served two decades in the military,&#34; Luria said on CNN. &#34;These voices, extremes on both the left and the right, get a lot of attention and I think it&#39;s important for someone like me, someone with a military background, someone who&#39;s a moderate and I think represents the views on either side of the aisle in the middle of a majority of Americans to speak out against these kinds of comments.&#34; 
Luria added that she is &#34;not attacking her personally. I&#39;m just calling out her words.&#34;

Specifically addressing Omar&#39;s Thursday clarification, Luria said she&#39;s &#34;taking that as she now is saying that the words she used she recognizes that she could&#39;ve used different words or a different comparison and I think we need to turn the page.&#34;

Reps. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass.; Brad Sherman, D-Calif.; Ted Deutch, D-Fla.; Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla.; Lois Frankel, D-Fla.; Kathy Manning, D-N.C.; Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.; Dean Phillips, D-Minn.; and Kim Schrier, D-Wash., didn&#39;t respond to requests for comment for this story. 
The latest episode of Omar and other &#34;Squad&#34; Democrats clashing with party moderates follows years of tensions between the factions.  
Just weeks ago, Democrats – including Wasserman Schultz and Omar – were going to the House floor giving radically different speeches on the fighting between Hamas and Israel. And as recently as 2019 the House passed a resolution condemning bigotry in response to comments from Omar suggesting that Israel supporters were pushing for U.S. politicians to declare &#34;allegiance&#34; to Israel. That was seen as a form of the longstanding &#34;dual loyalties&#34; trope that has been used against Jewish people for centuries.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott rips the progressive backlash against the Georgia election reform bill and discusses the border crisis.
Sen. Tim Scott
, R-S.C., has joined the growing backlash against 
Major League Baseball&#39;s
 decision to move this year&#39;s All-Star game in response to 
Georgia&#39;s
 controversial 
voting
 law.
LEO TERRELL: LEFT IS USING &#39;AL SHARPTON&#39;S PLAYBOOK,&#39; INTIMIDATING COMPANIES WITH RACISM CLAIMS
The &#34;Midsummer Classic&#34; was set for July 13 at Truist Park, home of the 
Atlanta Braves
, until the MLB decided Friday to change its location -- a decision that was cheered by several large corporations. On Monday, MLB announced the game will now be played at Coors Field, home of the 
Colorado Rockies
.
Democrats and voting rights advocates argue that Georgia&#39;s new voting law, signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp on March 25, would make it harder for people, particularly those of color, to vote. 
Republican supporters say the law is needed to restore confidence in Georgia’s elections following the contentious 2020 presidential election and Georgia&#39;s two U.S. Senate runoff elections in January.
COLORADO VOTING LAWS ARE SIMILAR TO GEORGIA&#39;S DESPITE DECISION TO MOVE MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL ALL-STAR GAME
In a tweet on Tuesday, Scott noted that Georgia has 17 days of early voting compared to Colorado&#39;s 15 days of early voting. 
Colorado also requires voters to show identification when voting in person, and the state says that first-time mail-in voters may be required to 
include a copy
 of their identification with their ballot. This is not far off from Georgia, which requires identification for in-person and absentee voting, although Georgia requires proof of identity for all absentee voting. 
According to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger&#39;s office, voters without ID can use the last four digits of their Social Security number, a utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or another government document with their name and address on it. Colorado relies on signature matching for absentee ballots other than those from first-time mail-in voters.
In addition, Colorado automatically sends absentee ballots to all registered voters, whereas Georgia only sends to those who request them, a measure meant to prevent sending ballots to the wrong address or to those no longer eligible to vote.
Scott also 
cited U.S. Census data from 2019
, which found that Atlanta is 51% Black and 40.9% White, while 
Denver
 is 9.2% Black and 76% White.
&#34;The MLB is moving the #MLBAllStarGame out of ATL which has more day of voting rights than CO?&#34; Scott tweeted. &#34;The Wokes are at it again folks.&#34;
GEORGIA VOTING LAW: READ FULL TEXT
Scott&#39;s tweet comes a day after 
Sen. Marco Rubio
 said the decision will &#34;have a bigger impact on countless small and minority-owned businesses in and around Atlanta, than the new election law ever will.&#34;
Nearly 30% of businesses in Atlanta are Black-owned, the 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution
 reported.
The 2020 All-Star Game, set to be hosted in Los Angeles, was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, which also cut last year&#39;s MLB regular season by more than half its normal length of 162 games. But the 2019 All-Star Game in Cleveland generated an estimated 
$65 million
 in regional economic activity.
Rubio also said the MLB&#39;s move &#34;reeks of hypocrisy&#34;, citing the organization&#39;s ties to Cuba and China. He argued relocating the All-Star game is an &#34;easy way to signal virtues without significant financial fallout&#34; but that &#34;speaking out against the Chinese Communist Party would involve a significant loss of revenue and being closed out of a lucrative market.&#34;
Former President Donald Trump
 and 
Sen. Rand Paul
 have also called for a boycott against the MLB in response to the move and 
Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott
 said he would not throw the ceremonial first pitch as planned at the Texas Rangers’ home opener, and that the state would no longer seek to host any future MLB events.

Georgia&#39;s legislation places new restrictions on voting by mail, adds voter ID requirements, and limits ballot drop boxes. It also mandates two Saturdays of early voting ahead of general elections, an increase from just one, and leaves two Sundays as optional. In addition, the legislation bans outside groups from handing out food or water to those waiting in line to vote.

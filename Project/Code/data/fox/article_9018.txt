The campaign of &#34;
Squad
&#34; member Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., has paid out over $100,000 for &#34;fundraising consulting&#34; to a Florida-based progressive firm founded and operated by a defund the police and anti-Israel activist, campaign filings show.
Tlaib&#39;s campaign and PAC 
sent $96,000
 in payments between March 2020 and March 2021 for &#34;fundraising consulting&#34; to Unbought Power LLC, a Florida-based firm that 
specializes
 in grassroots organizing and advocacy consulting. The campaign paid out another $18,000 to Unbought Power between April 2021 and June 2021, Federal Election Commission 
records
 released last Thursday show. 
Rasha Mubarak, the Palestinian-American activist who founded Unbought Power in March 2020, has been involved in grassroots advocacy for over 15 years and has assisted with Tlaib&#39;s political career over the course of the last decade. In March 2019, Mubarak 
tweeted
 that she &#34;mobilized&#34; her first political fundraiser 9 years earlier and said it was for Tlaib, who 
responded
 that she &#34;can&#39;t wait&#34; to organize a political fundraiser for her. 
Mubarak, who has publicly called for defunding the police multiple times, 
tweeted
 back in April that she believes the United States should &#34;abolish the police.&#34; In two
 separate
 
tweets
 from July 2020, Mubarak called for Orange County to &#34;defund the police.&#34;

The Florida activist has also tweeted about her involvement with Dream Defenders, an activist group that was co-founded by 
self-described
 socialist and former Bernie Sanders surrogate, Phillip Agnew. 
Dream Defenders has been vocal about 
defunding the police
 across their social media platforms. Last June, Mubarak 
tweeted
 a link to a Dream Defenders &#34;Sunday School&#34; session video about how to defund the police and 
encouraged her followers
 to donate to their bail fund amid the riots last summer. She also encouraged her followers to 
donate
 to the Dream Defenders organization.
In addition to advocating for defunding the police, she has used her Twitter account to push anti-Israel rhetoric.
TLAIB ALLY RUNS ORGANIZATION ACCUSED OF PROMOTING ANTI-SEMITISM
Tlaib received backlash in December 2020 after she 
retweeted
 a Mubarak tweet that included the anti-Israel slogan &#34;From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.&#34; The Democratic group, Democratic Majority for Israel, 
responded
 by calling this an &#34;immoral and reprehensible position&#34; and said the slogan means that Tlaib &#34;sees the entire State of Israel as illegitimate and wants it eliminated.&#34;
Earlier this year, Mubarak 
tweeted
 out her support for the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and 
boasted
 about her and Palestinian activists being able to &#34;shut down&#34; an anti-BDS bill in 2019. She has also 
repeatedly
 called Israel an &#34;apartheid&#34; state, which has been 
echoed
 by Tlaib herself.
Shortly before the 2020 election, Tlaib 
thanked
 Mubarak for her help organizing voters, saying her work was &#34;behind the scenes making things happen&#34; and added that &#34;coordinating this lineup with the #SquadTeams helped make it perfect,&#34; referring to one of the get-out-the-vote rallies she organized.
Mubarak has posted several pictures of her and Tlaib together on her Twitter account, including a &#34;Happy birthday&#34; tweet that included four different pictures of them together, and said she was &#34;grateful&#34; Tlaib was in her life. Two other clips show Mubarak 
riding in a car 
with Tlaib and Tlaib 
eating a meal
 with Mubarak alongside her family. Another 
video
 shows Mubarak, Tlaib, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., saying, &#34;Brown girls can.&#34;

Mubarak isn&#39;t the first controversial activist Tlaib&#39;s campaign has been shown to have ties to. Last month, Fox News 
reported
 about Tlaib&#39;s campaign taking $500 earlier this year from Tlaib ally Hatem Basian, who 
founded
 a controversial, advocacy organization the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) says has &#34;provided a platform for anti-Semitism.&#34; 
Tlaib&#39;s campaign did not respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.

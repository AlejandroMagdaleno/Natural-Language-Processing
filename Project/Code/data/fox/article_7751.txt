More than $131 million poured in to 
Republican
 campaigns in the second quarter ahead of the 2022 
midterm elections
 through the WinRed platform, which claims to have &#34;leveled the playing field&#34; in online fundraising.
WinRed, which helps federal, state and local Republican candidates raise money, brought in $124 million during the first quarter of 2021.
In the second quarter, $51.5 million WinRed donations came from first-time donors to campaigns. WinRed also saw $16.1 million in contributions to state and local GOP campaigns — up from just $8.8 million in the first quarter. 
A WinRed spokesperson told Fox News that more than 770 state-level GOP organization have signed up for the WinRed platform since March 2020, and said they are continuing to expand ahead of the 2022 midterms.

&#34;GOP campaigns are breaking records because they’re spending early to grow their lists and America wants a change in Congress,&#34; WinRed president Gerrit Lansing told Fox News. 
&#34;Combined with WinRed&#39;s toolset and conduit functionality, the good guys have leveled the playing field of online fundraising,&#34; Lansing added. 
Since its inception in 2019, WinRed has raised more than $2.3 billion – with more than $108 million going to House and Senate races.

WinRed is the GOP’s response to Democrats’ grassroots donation platform ActBlue. 
ActBlue, in April, touted its first quarter fundraising numbers as their &#34;biggest first quarter of any election cycle,&#34; bringing in more than $313 million. It is unclear how much ActBlue raised in the second quarter.

Arizona Republican 
Rep. Andy Biggs
 introduced legislation Thursday that would ban federal agencies from creating &#34;
vaccine passports
.&#34;
Vaccine passports are a method some have purposed to demonstrate whether or not an individual has been vaccinated from the deadly coronavirus.
WHAT IS A COVID VACCINE PASSPORT AND HOW WOULD IT WORK?
While proponents of such a system have said it would be helpful in reopening businesses and the travel industry, Republicans in Congress have condemned the idea as an invasion of privacy and an opening for government surveillance.
&#34;I am profoundly disturbed that the Biden Administration would even consider imposing vaccine passports on the American people,&#34; Biggs said in a statement Thursday. &#34;My private healthcare decisions—and yours—are nobody else’s business. Vaccine passports will not help our nation recover from COVID-19, instead, they will simply impose more Big Brother surveillance on our society.&#34;  
Biggs said Friday: &#34;Americans have to be proactive against the radical left, who have pushed the idea of vaccine passports.
&#34;If the White House truly opposes vaccine passports or similar requirements, then we welcome President Biden to support our bill to ensure the federal government stays out of people’s private healthcare decisions.&#34;
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WILL NOT REQUIRE COVID-19 VACCINE PASSPORTS, WHITE HOUSE SAYS
White House press secretary Jen Psaki suggested Tuesday that President Biden opposes passport vaccines.
&#34;Let me be very clear on this. I know there&#39;s been lots of questions,&#34;  Psaki said during a press briefing. &#34;The government is not now, nor will we be, supporting a system that requires Americans to carry a credential.&#34;
She added, &#34;There will be no federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential.&#34;
Some nations in Europe, along with Israel, are already using vaccine passports or are developing similar tracking methods.
Hawaii
 has floated the idea of instating a vaccine passport for travelers to their state, and New York became the first state to roll out a digital vaccine tracker, called the &#34;Excelsior Pass.&#34;

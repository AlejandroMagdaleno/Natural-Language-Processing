GOP congressional candidate Billy Prempeh outlines his campaign on &#39;Fox &amp; Friends.&#39;
GOP congressional candidate for 
New Jersey’s
 ninth district Billy Prempeh is taking a patriotic approach to his campaign, stressing the value of red, white and blue.
Prempeh joined &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends Weekend
&#34; on Sunday to outline the grounds of his campaign, explaining that being in the 
military
 taught him the true symbolism of the American flag.
&#34;When I decided to join the military and fight for the country, I understood that that flag meant more than just red, white and blue on a piece of cloth,&#34; he said. &#34;It actually symbolizes the unification of our nation and the many things our country has gone through up until this point.&#34;
&#34;The one thing that always stays constant with America is we always find a way to come through, we always find a way to come together and persevere,&#34; Prempeh explained. &#34;And that’s why so many countries follow our lead and we need to stand as a beacon of hope for the rest of the world.&#34;
Prempeh&#39;s comments come on the heels of the Black Lives Matter Utah Chapter&#39;s founder 
calling the American flag ‘a symbol of hatred&#39; 
in a fiery 4th of July Facebook post, with 
co-host Pete Hegseth
 noting that Prempeh sees it &#39;quite differently.&#39;
AIR FORCE PROFESSOR WHO TAUGHT CRITICAL RACE THEORY SHOULD BE FIRED, GOP REP SAYS
&#34;It [the flag] shouldn&#39;t become a political symbol,&#34; Prempeh said, explaining his belief the Left is &#34;trying to tear apart this country and divide us.&#34;
Emphasizing his stance as an outlier among his fellow millennials, Prempeh went on to note that the downfall of his generation is their ability to become quickly offended — arguing that the pure privilege of being American should be recognized first and foremost.
&#34;The truth is, we&#39;re always going to be the best nation on the planet.&#34;
Prempeh later mentioned the push to enforce critical race theory into the U.S. military, asserting that our defense should be mainly focused on defending our Constitution and &#34;protecting our allies across the world.&#34; 
While active in the 
Air Force
, Prempeh stated that his race was never a defining factor in his value to the unit, and that the only colors that mattered were the colors of the flag and the green of their uniform.

&#34;When you’re in boot camp, even, everybody’s at the bottom, everybody works their way to the top,&#34; he said. &#34;Those colors unify us all. We’re all green at the end of the day and we’re all red, white and blue. We’re all American.&#34;

Police
 responded to a 2018 incident in which a gun owned by 
Hunter Biden
, the son of 
President Biden
, was thrown in a trash can outside of a market in Delaware, sources tell Fox News. 
The story was first reported by 
The Blaze
 last year and then again by 
Politico
 on Thursday. 
A source with knowledge of the Oct. 23, 2018 police report told Fox News that it indicated that Hallie Biden, the widow of President Biden&#39;s late son Beau, who was in a relationship with Hunter at the time, threw a gun owned by Hunter in a dumpster behind a market that is near a school. 
A firearm transaction report reviewed by Fox News indicates that Hunter Biden purchased a gun earlier that month.

HUNTER BIDEN PROBE &#39;ACTIVE AND ONGOING&#39; WITHOUT WHITE HOUSE INTERFERENCE: SOURCES
The owner of the market confirmed to Fox News that the Delaware State Police were called to the market on Oct. 23, 2018. 
&#34;We did the right thing and called the police,&#34; the market&#39;s owner said. 
The owner also said that the market turned over its surveillance tape to the police. 
The Delaware State Police referred Fox News to the Delaware Attorney General&#39;s Office when asked about an Oct. 23, 2018 incident involving Hunter Biden, saying that the investigation had been referred to the state AG. The state police said Fox News would need to file a public records request to obtain the police report. 
Politico and The Blaze reported that nobody was charged or arrested as a result of the incident.

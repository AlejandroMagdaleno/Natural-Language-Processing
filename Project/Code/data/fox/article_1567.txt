President 
Joe Biden
 said Thursday he personally reached out to a hospital the night before to ensure the wife of his &#34;good friend&#34; received immediate care because the &#34;waiting room was so crowded.&#34;
&#34;Last night, I was on the telephone with a person at an emergency hospital ward in Pennsylvania because a good friend had called, and he had rushed his significant other to the emergency room because this woman was having trouble breathing, had a high fever, and could not catch her breath,&#34; Biden said during a speech in Illinois promoting 
COVID-19
 vaccine mandates for businesses. &#34;They got her into the hospital. The waiting room was so crowded, things were so backed up they couldn&#39;t even get her to be seen initially. So, because I knew this person, I called. I called the desk receiving nurse and asked what the situation was.&#34;
US DAILY COVID-19 DEATHS DECLINE 12% OVER 2 WEEKS
&#34;To make long story short, it took a while because all of the – not all – the vast majority of the emergency rooms and docs were occupied taking care of COVID patients,&#34; Biden added. &#34;I bet every one of you can name somebody who got sent to the hospital with something other than COVID and couldn&#39;t get it taken care of.&#34;
Biden said that he &#34;wasn’t complaining&#34; when he made the phone call because doctors and nurses working in overcrowded hospitals are &#34;getting the living hell kicked out of them, sometimes physically.&#34;
According to 
recent data

A seven-day moving average indicates a 12% decline over the last two weeks, from 1,630 on Sept. 21 to 1,428 on Oct. 5, per the latest available figures. Nevertheless, the country logged a grim milestone late Friday when the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 eclipsed 700,000.
Fox News did not immediately receive a response from the White House to a request for comment.

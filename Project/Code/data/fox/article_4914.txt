Fofana, a star on his high school soccer team, was reportedly involved in an altercation with Hernandez at Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey resulting in a shooting that left him dead and a 17-year-old injured.
Hernandez’s attorney confirmed his client is being held at an Essex County jail and that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has placed a detainer on him meaning they can apprehend him upon a release from jail. 
Hernandez’s attorney suggests his client shot Fofana in self-defense after Fofana and several others were following his 16-year-old brother.
&#34;It may be questionable where the gun was retrieved from,&#34; Hernandez’s public defender Sterling Kinsale said. &#34;But Mr. Hernandez used the gun to defend both he and his brother against individuals who (he) did not know - did not know what their purpose was - and who admitted in discovery as they gave statements to the state that they pursued these individuals with no clear purpose.&#34;

Hawa Fofana, Moussa’s mother, told 
the media
 that she hugged and kissed her son before he left home on the night of the alleged murder. 
&#34;He gave me a hug and I’m like, ‘You’re choking me,&#39;&#34; she said. &#34;He said, ‘Mommy, I’m just going to give you a kiss.’ He gave me a hug and a kiss, and then he left the house.&#34;
Fofana was well known in the area as an avid soccer player who spent countless hours playing the game on fields near where he died.

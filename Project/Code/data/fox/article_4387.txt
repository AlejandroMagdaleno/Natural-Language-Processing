Rep. John Joyce, R-PA, introduces the Guarding Readers’ Independence and Choice (GRINCH) Act to safeguard children’s literature from being ‘canceled’ on ‘America’s Newsroom.’
Rep. John Joyce, R-Pa., is fighting back against the 
cancel culture
 and argued no one is &#34;safe&#34; from the &#34;woke&#34; movement.
The 
Pennsylvania
 lawmaker is introducing the Guarding Readers’ Independence and Choice (GRINCH) Act to safeguard children’s literature from being &#34;canceled.&#34; The GRINCH Act will cut off government funding for agencies that censor books. 
&#34;The reaction has been so positive...the cancel culture is rapidly attacking our American institutions, our libraries, our school,&#34; Joyce told 
&#34;America’s Newsroom,&#34;
 Friday. &#34;I&#39;m alarmed at the left&#39;s attempt to cancel historic books characters.&#34;

Joyce added the GRINCH Act would prevent taxpayer dollars from supporting state and local governments from banning books. The Pennsylvania congressman said adult’s and children’s First Amendment rights &#34;must be defended.&#34;
&#34;If you find that these books are offensive to your children, then the parents should be the ones who make that decision. Government should not be making that,&#34; Joyce told co-host, Dana Perino. 
The GOP congressman hopes the GRINCH Act gains bipartisan support and thinks this bill should be able to reach &#34;across the aisle.&#34;

&#34;We have to understand that we cannot turn back and ban great historic people, great historic images that are part of our childhood,&#34; he told Perino. &#34;There are important lessons in these books.&#34;
The Pennsylvania lawmaker mentioned Dr. Seuss&#39;s books have been passed down for generations in his family and said the GRINCH Act sends an important message to America.

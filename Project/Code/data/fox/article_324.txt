FOX News contributor Andy McCarthy breaks down the three investigations into the governor&#39;s pandemic response on &#39;Your World&#39;
Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y. received praise from her ideological opponents Friday after announcing her support for a &#34;full investigation&#34; into Democratic New York Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
&#39;s nursing home scandal.

Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses the controversial nomination on &#39;The Story&#39;
Senate
 
Energy and Natural Resources Committee ranking member John Barrasso, R-Wyo., grilled Interior Secretary Deb Haaland over tree-spiking and 
President Biden’s
 nominee to lead the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).
Barrasso pursued his line of questioning during a Tuesday 
committee hearing
 on the president’s Department of Interior budget request.
The Wyoming senator – who is leading the charge against Biden’s BLM nominee Tracy Stone-Manning – 
asked
 
Biden’s secretary about the legality of spiking trees and if the act can &#34;kill or maim loggers and mill workers.&#34;
BIDEN NOMINEE FOR LAND AGENCY TOUTED HUSBAND’S SUGGESTION TO LET HOUSES CAUGHT IN FOREST FIRES ‘BURN’
Haaland said she could &#34;imagine&#34; the ecoterrorism tactic could kill people and that she was not &#34;familiar&#34; with the &#34;practice until recently.&#34;
The interior secretary also said she &#34;couldn&#39;t tell&#34; Barrasso &#34;for sure&#34; whether tree-spiking is a federal crime – it is and has been 
since 1988
 – and added that she imagines it&#39;s &#34;very dangerous.&#34;
&#34;Should individuals who are aware of spiked trees, in terms of national forests, immediately inform law enforcement?&#34; Barrasso asked, to which Haaland replied that she imagines that &#34;anyone should inform law enforcement if it&#39;s a danger.&#34;
&#34;So I guess the question is, should individuals who plan or otherwise are involved in tree-spiking incidents and threaten physical safety of federal officials expect to be hired by the Department of the Interior?&#34; Barrasso continued.
&#34;Senator, I believe you’re referring to the nominee, Tracy Stone-Manning,&#34; Haaland responded. &#34;I also recognize that she was nominated by President Biden because he felt she could do the job and that she was qualified.&#34;
BIDEN NOMINEE CALLED FOR POPULATION CONTROL TO PROTECT ENVIRONMENT: ‘WE MUST BREED FEWER CONSUMING HUMANS’
Barrasso also pressed Haaland on Stone-Manning’s environmental views, asking the secretary whether she agreed with the statement &#34;‘Perhaps the solution to houses in the interface is to let them burn’&#34; – a direct quote from a 2018 article by Stone-Manning’s husband that the nominee referred to as a &#34;Clarion call&#34; in a 2020 tweet.
&#34;Well, I can&#39;t necessarily agree or disagree, but I think the wildfires are getting more intense because of climate change,&#34; Haaland responded. &#34;That’s why we need preventative measures and put resources toward protecting communities.&#34;
Haaland was also asked if she agreed with Stone-Manning’s husband’s statement that there is &#34;a rude and satisfying justice in burning down the house of someone who builds in the forest&#34; and if children are an &#34;environmental hazard&#34; – a direct quote from Stone-Manning’s graduate thesis – to both of which Haaland answered &#34;no.&#34;
&#34;You wouldn’t necessarily want to hire an employee in a land management position who agrees or puts forth these statements about ‘satisfying justice’ about letting houses burn or ‘children as environmental hazards’?&#34; Barrasso asked.
&#34;Senator, what I will say is that I, as secretary of the Interior, am not personally hiring anyone,&#34; Haaland responded. &#34;I believe that is a team effort and I know that the Senate plays a very large role in any of these positions as well.&#34;

Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, also 
unloaded
 
onto Haaland over the nomination, bringing up Stone-Manning&#39;s support of her husband’s call to let houses caught in forest fires burn.
&#34;I had not read any of that, senator, and, yes I am the secretary of the Interior, but she is the president’s nominee,&#34; Haaland said. &#34;I didn&#39;t nominate her. I am here to move the department forward on the president’s priorities, and that’s what I’m focused on at the moment.&#34;

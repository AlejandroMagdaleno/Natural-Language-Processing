A tense situation in 
Port-au-Prince
 occurred Tuesday when many deported Haitian 
migrants 
expressed anger and some even tried unsuccessfully to get back on a plane returning to the U.S. 
The Department of Homeland Security confirmed to Fox News Tuesday that three U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were injured after &#34;two separate disruptions&#34; by Haitian migrants when they deplaned on the tarmac at Port-au-Prince. The injuries were not life-threatening.
The expulsion flights back to Haiti started on Sunday and more than 500 Haitians have been removed from the country, according to Reuters. 
Filippo Grandi, the head of the U.N refugee agency, said the expulsions might violate international law by sending refugees back to life-threatening situations and Senate Majority Leader 
Chuck Schumer
 said the deportations &#34;defy common sense,&#34; Reuters reported. 
President Biden
 faced a backlash this week over the administration’s deportations of Haitian 
migrants 
camped along the U.S. border in 
Texas 
seeking asylum, according to reports.

The country has been destabilized in recent months by the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, a destructive earthquake and increasing gang violence, according to 
Reuters
. 
&#34;People want to stay home, they don&#39;t want to leave home, but they leave when they cannot satisfy their basic needs,&#34; Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters this week, adding that the U.S. needs to &#34;do a lot more&#34; to support Haitians. 
The Haitians are being deported through a 
coronavirus 
pandemic policy that allows the U.S. to deny migrants the opportunity to seek asylum.

Fox News contributor Joe Concha on critics blasting Vice President Kamala Harris for failing to visit the border.
Rep. 
Chuck Fleischmann
, R-Tenn., and six other 
GOP lawmakers
 are urging Vice President 
Kamala Harris
 to visit the U.S.-Mexico border as soon as possible.
Congress members note that President Biden on March 24 tapped Harris to 
lead
 &#34;efforts to stem migration across the U.S.-Mexico border.&#34;
&#34;There is no substitute for seeing overcrowded migrant facilities in person and speaking directly with our border agents and officers who are dealing with this crisis on the human level every day,&#34; Fleischmann, ranking member on the House Appropriations Committee&#39;s Homeland Security Subcommittee, wrote.

The Biden administration continues to grapple with what some lawmakers are describing as a &#34;crisis&#34; at the border.

While single adults make up the largest number of CBP encounters, the agency has seen a &#34;significant increase&#34; in unaccompanied minors traveling from Central America. CBP recorded nearly 19,000 unaccompanied minor encounters in March -- a 100% increase since February.
While unaccompanied minor encounters made up only 11% of total encounters in March, they make up the largest demographic group being held in 
overcrowded
 CPB facilities.

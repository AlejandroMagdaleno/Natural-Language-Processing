Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said this week she &#34;definitely&#34; plans to run for president again after bowing out of the 2020 race in August 2019 because she failed to meet the fundraising and polling threshold for the September debate. 
&#34;I definitely want to run for president again,&#34; Gillibrand told Politico in an interview. &#34;I learned so much on that campaign: about myself, about the country, about how to be successful as a politician. I became a much better speaker and became better at my job.&#34;
The New York Democrat said she feels more &#34;energized&#34; than ever to be a senator, coming after she joined forces with Republican Joni Ernst of Iowa to push a bill to overhaul military sex crimes. And after years of pressing for it, federal paid family leave is gaining traction in her party. Ernst and Gillibrand have reportedly developed a close friendship outside of the office.

Gillibrand has evolved with her party’s leftward lurch, appointed to fill Hillary Clinton’s seat as a pro-gun member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition and budding into a staunch progressive who launched into the limelight in the #MeToo movement. She’s known for being the first to call on Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., to resign amid multiple misconduct allegations, though many others quickly joined her, though some Democrats now feel calling for Franken’s resignation was a rush to judgment.

On the campaign trail, Gillibrand said that her stance had alienated donors and some voters in his neighboring, make-or-break Iowa.
Gillibrand made women&#39;s issues the central focus of her first campaign, homing in on curbing sexual harassment and promoting equal pay for women and family leave, coupled with a staunch defense of abortion rights.

told Politico.

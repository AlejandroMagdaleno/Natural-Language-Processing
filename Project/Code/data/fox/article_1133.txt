CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky details the status of coronavirus vaccine production and distribution on &#39;Fox News Sunday&#39;
The new head of the 
Center for Disease Control
 (CDC) said Sunday that the U.S. has to &#34;go faster&#34; than the 
Biden
 administration&#39;s current goal of 100 million 
coronavirus
 
vaccinations
 in 100 days.
Dr. 
Rochelle Walensky
 acknowledged that the administration faces certain constraints in its &#34;race&#34; against the virus.
&#34;The first is the supply, and we’re working closely with manufacturers so that does not become a constraint,&#34; Walensky told &#34;
Fox News Sunday
&#34; host Chris Wallace. &#34;We also need to sort of make sure that this, the supply, gets to pharmacies, that we have enough vaccinators, that we have enough places and outreach to do the vaccination.&#34;

Walensky stressed that the picture is optimistic, with the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine set to be approved in the weeks ahead, and that a fourth vaccine could be approved shortly after that.
Biden&#39;s nominee for Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, echoed the sentiment that the administration&#39;s vaccination goal is on the low side.
&#34;That’s a floor, that’s not a ceiling,&#34; Murthy told 
&#34;This Week&#34;
 host George Stephanopoulos on ABC. &#34;We&#39;ve got to increase supply, which we can do using the Defense Production Act, but we have to set up distribution channels like mobile units that can reach people.&#34;
CDC SAYS COVID-19 VACCINE DOSES CAN BE GIVEN 6 WEEKS APART, WARNS JABS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE
The need for vaccinations has increased as new variant strains of COVID-19 have appeared across the world: the U.K. strain of the virus has proven to be more contagious and 
possibly more virulent
.
The U.K. strain has appeared in almost two dozen states in the U.S. So far, no other strains have appeared, but some believe that it is only a matter of time.

When asked if the administration feels pressure to vaccinate more people as new strains appear in the U.S., Walensky said that the pressure has not changed.
&#34;I would say we’ve been a race all along,&#34; Walensky said. &#34;The more virus that is out there, the more virus that is replicating, the more likely that we are going to have mutations and variants.&#34;

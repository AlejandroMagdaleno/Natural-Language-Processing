Gaza Strip
 would not be used to restock Hamas’ 
military stockpiles
.
The official made the admission during a call ahead of Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s upcoming trip to the Middle East. Blinken is expected to push Israel, Hamas and other regional powers to ensure that a recently brokered cease-fire remains in place.

Fox News contributor Leo Terrell on the recall effort against California Gov. Gavin Newsom gaining over 2 million signatures and the coronavirus stimulus package.
California 
Gov. Gavin Newsom
 is trying to play &#34;racial politics&#34; amid the pressure of the 
recall
 effort that is gaining momentum, Fox News contributor Leo Terrell said on Wednesday.
&#34;I&#39;m so sick of the Democrats. Normally, they play the race card every four years. They&#39;re playing the race card every day, 24/7,&#34; Terrell told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
.&#34;
Terrell said Newsom’s claim that the recall effort being supported by extremist groups is a &#34;big lie.&#34;
&#34;Last year was the first time that I wanted to leave this state. Why? Because he basically locked it down for no reason. He didn&#39;t follow the science and he deserved to be recalled. But the lies about who supports this recall, it&#39;s everyone of all colors, shapes, sizes and all political parties.&#34;
NEWSOM SUGGESTS RECALL MOTIVES ARE RACIST
Newsom
 has suggested a racist motive behind the effort to recall him, saying the authors of the petition fear California is becoming less White under his leadership.
&#34;Look at the petition, look at the actual reasons they themselves listed. It has to do with immigration. The ‘Browning’ of California,&#34; Newsom said, using air quotes to emphasize &#34;Browning.&#34;
Newsom spoke to reporters Tuesday at an Alameda County, California, elementary school. The petition for his recall does not mention race. It states, among other reasons for his removal: &#34;Laws he endorsed favor foreign nationals, in our country illegally, over that of our own citizens.&#34;
The recall petition was prompted by Newsom’s strict handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but the governor said it was fueled by alt-right conspiracy theorists and Donald Trump supporters.

Terrell said that racial politics is the &#34;Democrats’ playbook.&#34; He also 
commented
 on Newsom&#39;s consideration of a Black senator to fill the spot of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
&#34;I think right now it&#39;s one of the most insulting aspects of racial politics the Democrats believe just because they&#39;re going to nominate a Black person, all Black folks are supposed to follow that,&#34; he said, adding that Black voters are increasingly rejecting the strategy
&#34;But the Democrats will play it 24/7. It’s their playbook and they&#39;re going to stick to it all the time.&#34;

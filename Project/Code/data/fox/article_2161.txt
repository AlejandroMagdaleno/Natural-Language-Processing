Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer discusses the movement to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom in California and whether he might challenge him in 2022.
&#34;Hundreds&#34; of 
violent and sexual threats
 have been made against 
California 
Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
, his wife, children and businesses, prompting 
law enforcement
 agencies to investigate, according to reports.
Many of the alleged phone, email and social media threats have come in to a number of wineries and businesses the governor started through the PlumpJack Group, a hospitality company he founded in 1992, the Sacramento Bee reported. 
&#34;The tone and the verbiage of some of these death threats are shocking,&#34; a PlumpJack representative, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons, told the newspaper. &#34;They are very black-and-white death threats to our employees, to Gavin, his children, his wife.&#34;
Some of the messages specifically contained violent sexual threats against the governor’s wife, according to a Bee reporter who listened to and read some of the threats.

The threats have come as Newsom faces a 
recall effort
 led by Republicans over his coronavirus stay-at-home orders and over criticism that he 
dined out at an expensive Napa restaurant
 while state residents were being urged to stay at home.

In one threat issued to a winery, the suspect claimed they wanted to burn down the building while patrons were inside.
A spokesman for Newsom’s Office of Emergency Services said it was aware of the threats and confirmed that several law enforcement agencies were investigating.

&#34;Any threats against elected officials, including public or private property, are taken seriously and closely monitored by the appropriate local, state or federal law enforcement,&#34; spokesman Brian Ferguson said.

A false rumor has also circulated online, claiming Newsom paid PlumpJack coronavirus aid money through state funds, the Bee reported. The company did receive close to $3 million in federal aid but none from California. Newsom also put his businesses in a blind trust to avoid the appearance of impropriety when he took office. 
Separately, a Napa County man was 
arrested
 and charged last Tuesday on a $5 million bond after 
FBI
 investigators found five &#34;fully operational&#34; pipe bombs and an illegal weapons stockpile at his home and business two weeks ago. He had allegeldy planned to blow up offices belonging to 
Newsom
, as well as 
Facebook
 and 
Twitter
, prosecutors say.  
Ian Benjamin Rogers, 44, from Napa, also had a sticker on his vehicle commonly used by so-called &#34;Three Percenters,&#34; and officers executing search warrants found a &#34;White Privilege Card&#34; and several weapons-related manuals including some from the U.S. Army, as well as &#34;The Anarchist Cookbook,&#34; a known how-to guide for creating explosives, FBI investigators said.

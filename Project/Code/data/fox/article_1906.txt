Secretary of State Antony Blinken discusses President Biden&#39;s foreign policy as he meets with allies and Vladimir Putin on the president&#39;s first foreign trip
Secretary of State
 Antony Blinken called the World Health Organization&#39;s first study on the 
coronavirus
 pandemic&#39;s origins &#34;highly deficient&#34; and said G-7 leaders will insist 
China
 cooperate with a second WHO study.
&#34;The WHO, you&#39;re right, the first study they put out was highly deficient,&#34; Blinken told &#34;
Fox News Sunday
&#34; host Chris Wallace. &#34;The leaders of the G-7 have come together insisting that China cooperate with the so-called phase two study by the WHO to really get to the  bottom of what happened. But that&#39;s not enough.
CHINA OFFICIAL INSISTS COVID LAB-LEAK THEORY &#39;ABSURD&#39; IN BLINKEN CALL
&#34;We need to get to the bottom of what happened. We need accountability, but we also need to understand what happened, why it happened, how it happened, if we&#39;re going to be able to put in place the necessary measures to prevent it from happening again, or at least be in a better place to mitigate the next pandemic if we can&#39;t fully prevent one,&#34; Blinken continued.
High-ranking Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi, head of Beijing’s Central Foreign Affairs Commission, 
told Blinken
 on Friday that the Wuhan lab leak theory is an &#34;absurd story,&#34; according to Chinese state media.

President Biden has tasked the intelligence community with getting to the bottom of the coronavirus pandemic&#39;s origin.
&#34;He ordered back in March that we try to determine for ourselves the origins of COVID-19,&#34; Blinken said. &#34;We came up with two plausible explanations: One is the so-called natural occurrence; ... the other is a lab leak. but we couldn&#39;t determine with any degree of certainty which one it was.&#34;
BIDEN STATE DEPARTMENT QUIETLY ENDED TEAM&#39;S WORK PROBING COVID ORIGIN
In May, Biden issued a public statement that said the U.S. intelligence community has &#34;coalesced around two likely scenarios&#34; for the origins of the pandemic, &#34;including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident,&#34; and asked for &#34;additional follow-up.&#34; 
The president asked the intelligence community to &#34;redouble their efforts to collect and analyze information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to me in 90 days,&#34; Biden said.
It&#39;s unclear what action the U.S. would take depending on the results of the investigation.
&#34;Would the president seek to punish China?&#34; Fox News’ Peter Doocy 
asked
 White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre in May. 
&#34;We&#39;re not going to go there just yet,&#34; Jean-Pierre said. &#34;We have to go through the 90-day review. And once we have the 90-day review, will we be able to reassess.&#34;

Doocy pressed again: &#34;If another nation either was responsible or knew more than they were letting on … what would the president do?&#34; 
&#34;I&#39;m just not going to pre-judge. I&#39;m not going to make a statement until … we know what happens after this 90-day review,&#34; Jean-Pierre said.

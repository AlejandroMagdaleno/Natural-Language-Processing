Louisiana Republican sounds off on the &#39;defund the police&#39; movement on &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight&#39;
Senate Judiciary Committee Member John Kennedy, R-La., said Democrats like Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 and 
President Biden
 are creating a dangerous environment for police, and that the Bronx lawmaker in particular is showing her &#34;contempt&#34; for both law enforcement and America as a nation.
Kennedy remarked he knew Biden was &#34;left of center&#34; but never envisioned the Delawarean to be &#34;left of [Soviet leader Vladimir] Lenin.&#34;
&#34;I’m disappointed in President Biden. He has encouraged this. I listened to him last night. He knows better,&#34; said Kennedy. &#34;No one can get to be his age with his experience and not know this is nonsense... It’s hurting America and it’s hurting people.&#34;
Regarding Ocasio-Cortez, Kennedy reacted to a social media video she posted saying that Derek Chauvin being found guilty &#34;isn&#39;t justice&#34; and that justice is &#34;a government that does not value military and armaments more than it values health care, education and housing.&#34;
&#34;Sandy Cortez of Boston University; defining &#39;Justice&#39; for America,&#34; remarked host 
Tucker Carlson
, and asking Kennedy for his reaction:
&#34;I’m listening to the congresswoman and I’m thinking, no disrespect, but how does anyone get to be her age and believe that drivel?&#34; he asked.
&#34;No fair-minded person believes that cops, many of whom are racial minorities, get up every day and go to work hoping for the opportunity to be able to hurt someone -- but the Wokeristas like the congresswoman, they really believe it. They really do hate cops just because they’re cops.&#34; 
Kennedy said the left wing&#39;s vision of a nation without police would result in the U.S. becoming &#34;a fantastic impression of Hell.&#34;

&#34;The Wokeristas really do believe that when a cop shoots a criminal, it is always, every single time the cops fall but when a criminal shoots a cop, it’s always, every single time, the gun’s fault,&#34; he added.
Regarding what he called the incompetence of that worldview, the Louisiana lawmaker remarked that &#34;Jellyfish have survived 650 million years without a brain, so there is hope for them.&#34;

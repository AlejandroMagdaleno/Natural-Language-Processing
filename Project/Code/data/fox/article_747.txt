Former HHS secretary Dr. Tom Price weighs in as US speeds up pace of COVID vaccinations on &#39;FOX Report&#39;
President Biden
 wants Americans to wear face masks to prevent the spread of 
coronavirus
 &#34;until everyone is, in fact, vaccinated,&#34; he said on Monday.
&#34;I urge all local docs and ministers and priests to talk about why, why it’s important to get that vaccine and even after that, until everyone is, in fact, vaccinated, to wear this mask,&#34; Biden said after giving an 
address
 on his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan.
BIDEN SAYS &#39;LOCAL PREACHERS&#39; BETTER THAN TRUMP FOR CONVINCING ‘MAGA FOLKS’ TO TAKE COVID-19 VACCINE
After his inauguration in Janury, Biden urged citizens to &#34;mask up&#34; for the next 100 days as federal and state governments work to make vaccines available.

The Biden administration set a goal of administering 100 million vaccine shots within the president’s first 100 days in office. As of Monday, more than 92 million doses were administered, according to CDC data.
Meanwhile, the CDC has also found that Americans&#39; hesitancy to get the vaccine is 
declining
 but not going away.
Biden 
said
 in February that the U.S. will have enough supply of the COVID-19 vaccine by the end of the summer to inoculate 300 million Americans. However, he has also said that Americans should expect to continue to wearing masks into 2022.

President Biden&#39;s
 tone on 
Afghanistan,
 particularly concerning nation-building, has drastically shifted over the years.
Before the U.S. withdrew all troops out of Afghanistan on Aug. 31, Biden spent years advocating for the likes of nation-building in the country, a stark contrast to his recent rhetoric.
&#34;Remember why we went to Afghanistan in the first place? Because we were attacked by Usama bin Laden and 
al Qaeda
 on Sept. 11, 2001,&#34; 
Biden said
 on Aug. 31 as he addressed the nation following the withdrawal. &#34;We delivered justice to bin Laden on May 2, 2011 – over a decade ago.&#34;
&#34;We had no vital interest in Afghanistan other than to prevent an attack on America&#39;s homeland and our friends,&#34; he continued.

But those remarks seem to contradict statements he made during his time as a senator.
&#34;Whatever we do in Afghanistan, whether it involves the commitment of military, political or humanitarian assets, must be geared toward a long-term solution,&#34; Biden said on Oct. 3, 2001. &#34;We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past. If we think only in the short-term, only of getting bin Laden and the Taliban, which we must do, we just are begging for greater trouble down the line.&#34;
In his recent address to the nation, Biden also said the U.S. was never in 
Afghanistan
 to nation-build – a complete departure from his past stance on efforts in the region.

&#34;We did not go to Afghanistan to nation-build,&#34; Biden said on Aug. 31. And during a 2019 Democratic debate, Biden said he had gotten in a &#34;big fight for a long time with the Pentagon&#34; because he strongly opposed the nation-building notion.
But on Jan. 31, 2008, Biden said: &#34;As every military expert that testified before our committee has noted, the battle against the Taliban is not going to be won with bullets and bombs alone. It&#39;s going to be won with roads, clinics and schools.&#34;
Similarly, Biden said later in 2001 that the U.S. must prove to the world that it is an agent of &#34;reconstruction.&#34;
Biden also said during his recent remarks that it&#39;s &#34;the responsibility of Afghan people alone to decide their future and how they want to run their country. Conversely, in 2008, Biden said the U.S. had to aim higher and deliver more after it had already invested more than $6 billion in Afghanistan.

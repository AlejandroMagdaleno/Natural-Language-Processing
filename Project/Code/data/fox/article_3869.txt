PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) – 
A former speaker of the 
Oregon
 House and current lobbyist in Salem has been accused by Portland Police of 
soliciting sex
 from an undercover officer. The charge was first reported by the Portland Tribune.
Democrat Dave Hunt lives in Milwaukie and represented parts of northern Clackamas County in the Legislature for a decade, The Oregonian/OregonLive

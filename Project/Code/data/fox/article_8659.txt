Investigative journalist Peter Chowka discusses the senators’ oppositions to President Biden’s nominee.
Sen. 
Susan Collins
, R-Maine, said Monday that she will not support 
President Biden&#39;s
 nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Neera Tanden, dealing another blow to the odds of confirmation.
&#34;Congress has to be able to trust the OMB director to make countless decisions in an impartial manner, carrying out the letter of the law and congressional intent,&#34; Collins said in a statement on Monday. &#34;Neera Tanden has neither the experience nor the temperament to lead this critical agency.&#34;
BIDEN OMB PICK TANDEN CALLED OUT DURING CONFIRMATION HEARING FOR ANTI-GOP TWEETS, SAYS &#39;I&#39;M SORRY&#39;
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said last week that he would 
oppose
 her nomination, partially because of her &#34;overly partisan&#34; statements and tweets. Collins also voiced concerns over Tanden&#39;s Twitter account.
&#34;Ms. Tanden&#39;s decision to delete more than a thousand tweets in the days before her nomination was announced raises concerns about her commitment to transparency,&#34; Collins said. &#34;Should Congress need to review documents or actions taken by OMB, we must have confidence that the Director will be forthcoming.&#34;

&#34;The OMB needs steady, experienced, responsive leadership. I will vote against confirming  Ms. Tanden,&#34; Collins concluded.
The White House is still standing behind Tanden.
&#34;Neera Tanden=accomplished policy expert, would be 1st Asian American woman to lead OMB, has lived experience having benefitted from a number of federal programs as a kid, looking ahead to the committee votes this week and continuing to work toward her confirmation,&#34; White House press secretary Jen Psaki wrote on 
Twitter
 after Collin&#39;s announcement.
On Friday, Biden 
said
 he will not pull the nomination of Neera Tanden to be head of the OMB despite her nomination being dealt a significant blow after Manchin said he would vote against her.
&#34;I think we are going to find the votes to get her confirmed,&#34; Biden said.
In her Senate confirmation hearing
, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said that even after Tanden deleted many of her tweets attacking Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, there were still nine pages of posts still up.
&#34;I wonder, specifically, how do you plan to mend fences and build relationships with members of Congress you have attacked through your public statements?&#34; Portman asked.
MANCHIN TO OPPOSE BIDEN OMB PICK NEERA TANDEN OVER CONTROVERSIAL TWITTER POSTS
Tanden apologized for the tweets, saying: &#34;I deeply regret and apologize for my language -- some of my past language.&#34; 
&#34;I recognize that this role is a bipartisan role, and I know I have to earn the trust of senators across the board. I will work very aggressively to meet that concern,&#34; she said.

CSIS Middle East program director Jon Alterman analyzes the conflict in Israel and the push to oust Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
California
 
Democratic
 Rep. Brad Sherman denounced Hamas&#39; rocket attacks, saying Monday that each of the 4,500 fired on 
Israel
 constituted a &#34;war crime.&#34;
&#34;Hamas has fired 4,500 rockets into Israel for the sole purpose of killing as many civilians as possible. Every one of these rockets was a war crime,&#34; Sherman told 
Secretary of State
 Antony Blinken.
Blinken was appearing before the House Foreign Affairs Committee to discuss his department&#39;s 2022 budget – just weeks after another flare up in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. During the hearing, Sherman emphasized the importance of Israel&#39;s missile defense system, the Iron Dome, and asked how the Biden administration would work to replenish it after it had intercepted thousands of rockets.
Sherman told Blinken that Israel&#39;s missile defense system &#34;saved countless Israeli civilian lives and also, countless Palestinian lives by helping bring this fight to a more speedy conclusion.&#34;

He added that &#34;unfortunately, we won&#39;t bring the criminals to international justice, but we can prevent those crimes in the future by replenishing [the] Iron Dome.&#34; 
Blinken told Sherman that the Biden administration was &#34;committed&#34; to &#34;the Iron Dome&#39;s replenishment.&#34;

Sherman&#39;s comments came as many Democrats, including fellow committee member 
Ilhan Omar
, D-Minn., 
criticized Israeli attacks
 on Hamas in Gaza. In May, she 
said
: &#34;It would be appalling for the Biden administration to go through with $735 million in precision-guided weaponry to Netanyahu without any strings attached in the wake of escalating violence and attacks on civilians.&#34;
In a tweet that month, she argued, &#34;Israeli air strikes killing civilians in Gaza is an act of terrorism. Palestinians deserve protection. Unlike Israel, missile defense programs, such as Iron Dome, don’t exist to protect Palestinian civilians.&#34;

The U.S. Capitol is in lockdown after a car crashed into the gate surrounding the building.
Senate leadership were among those who offered prayers and condolences after news broke that one Capitol Police officer was killed and another injured in a 
Good Friday attack
 at the Capitol.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., ordered all flags to be lowered to half staff Friday afternoon.
The attack began when a car rammed into two Capitol Police officers at a barricade outside the U.S. Capitol. The driver proceeded to get out of the vehicle brandishing a knife, before being shot by officers. Both Capitol Police officers and the driver were taken to the hospital, and one officer died, as did the suspect. 
Lawmakers were not at work at the Capitol complex Friday, since Congress is on spring recess, and many had returned home to their districts. 
&#34;I’m heartbroken for the officer killed today defending our Capitol and for his family. I’m praying for the officer injured and his family,&#34; Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, said in a statement. &#34;We&#39;re in their debt.&#34;
&#34;We thank the Capitol Police, National Guard, and first responders for all they do to protect the Capitol and those inside,&#34; he added. 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he was &#34;Praying for the United States Capitol Police officers who were attacked at the Capitol.&#34; 
&#34;We are still learning what’s taken place,&#34; he added. &#34;Grateful to all the USCP and first responders who are on the scene.&#34;
House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., also tweeted support for the officers.
&#34;Please join me in prayer for the two Capitol Police officers and their families,&#34; McCarthy tweeted. &#34;They reacted quickly and bravely, as did all the other first responders at the scene. The whole country is pulling for them right now.&#34;
The crash and shooting happened at a security checkpoint near the Capitol as Congress is on recess. It comes as the Washington region remains on edge nearly three months after a mob stormed the Capitol as Congress was voting to certify Joe Biden’s presidential win.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren mourned the loss of the officer. &#34;My heart goes out to the loved ones of the officer killed at the Capitol today, the officer who remains hospitalized, and to the entire @Capitol Police force who protect us every day,&#34; she tweeted.
&#34;This is another tragedy,&#34; she added. 
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., thanked all the officers who protect the Capitol. 
&#34;The brave men and women of the United States Capitol Police put their lives on the line every day to protect the heart of our democracy,&#34; Klobuchar said in a statement. &#34;We are hoping and praying for the recovery of those injured in the line of duty.&#34;
Washington, D.C. National Guard were deployed to the Capitol following the attack, officials confirmed for Fox News. National Guard soldiers and airmen arrived on the scene to assist Captiol Police officers. 
Georgia Democrat Sen. Raphael Warnock joined the incensed reactions on twitter saying, &#34;My heart is heavy following the death of another U.S. Capitol police officer, and my thoughts are with their loved ones. I’m thankful for the quick response at the scene, and pray for an urgent, active peace across our nation that brings an end to this senseless violence.&#34;
Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz and his wife extended their &#34;deepest condolences on the loss of one of the U.S. Capitol Police&#39;s finest.&#34;
&#34;We will continue to pray for the second officer in the hospital,&#34; he  said on Twitter. &#34;Thank you to all of the brave men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police.&#34;

Speaker of the House 
Nancy Pelosi
 called for the resignation of New York Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 Tuesday, following an explosive report by the state attorney general’s office that alleged he sexually harassed multiple women. 
&#34;Under Attorney General Letitia James, a comprehensive and independent investigation into the allegations against Governor Cuomo has been completed. As always, I commend the women who came forward to speak their truth,&#34; Pelosi said in a statement.

&#34;Recognizing his love of New York and the respect for the office he holds, I call upon the Governor to resign,&#34; she added. 
Pelosi is just the latest in a line of Democrats calling for Cuomo’s resignation Tuesday, including President Biden and New York&#39;s two U.S. senators. 
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kristen Gillibrand called the actions by the New York governor &#34;profoundly disturbing, inappropriate and completely unacceptable.&#34;
&#34;No elected official is above the law,&#34; the two said in a joint statement. &#34;The people of New York deserve better leadership in the governor’s office. We continue to believe that the Governor should resign.&#34;
The investigation led by the New York attorney general’s office found that Cuomo engaged in &#34;unwelcome and nonconsensual touching&#34; and made comments of a sexually &#34;suggestive&#34; nature.

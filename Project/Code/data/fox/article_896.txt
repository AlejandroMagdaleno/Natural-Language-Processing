The Fox News contributor says that President Biden is waging war on small businesses as inflation fears grow—but CNN doesn’t seem to notice
Forty-eight-year political veteran 
President Biden
 raised eyebrows on Wednesday when he claimed to have driven an 18-wheeler truck — a claim the 
White House
 struggled to defend.
Biden was visiting a Mack Truck facility in Pennsylvania when he made the claim to have driven the massive trucks before, which require a special kind of license.
&#34;I used to drive an 18-wheeler, man,&#34; Biden said on Wednesday in a video posted to Twitter. &#34;I got to.&#34;

There is scant evidence that Biden has ever driven an 18-wheeler truck.
When asked if the president had ever driven such a truck, a White House spokesperson pointed to a December 1973 
article
 
from the Wilmington Evening Journal that showed Biden rode in an 18-wheeler on a 536-mile haul to Ohio.
Fox News pressed the spokesperson about the president’s claim – noting that riding in a truck is not the same as driving one – at which point the president&#39;s spokesperson pointed to a United Federation of Teachers 
post
 
that touched on Biden driving a 
school bus
 in the past as a summer job.

The majority of school buses, on average, &#34;have two axles, with the bigger models having two wheels on the front axle and four wheels on the dual axle, for a total of six wheels,&#34; according to

.
Fox News pressed again about the president’s claim, pointing out that a school bus is not the same as an 18-wheeler truck, but did not receive a response by publishing time.

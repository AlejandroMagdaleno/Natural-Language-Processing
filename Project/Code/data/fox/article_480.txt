FOX News correspondent Gillian Turner joins &#39;Special Report&#39; with the details 
The top 
Democrat
 and top 
Republican
 on the House Armed Services Committee said they want to see 
National Guard
 troops protecting the U.S. Capitol &#34;return home to their families,&#34; as the cost of the extended mission grows.
In a statement released Thursday, Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., and Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., said &#34;the present security posture is not warranted at this time.&#34;
DEFENSE SECRETARY AUSTIN OVERRULED NATIONAL GUARD CHIEF ON KEEPING TROOPS AT CAPITOL: MEMO
&#34;As the U.S. Capitol Police continues to build its personnel capacity, there is no doubt that some level of support from the National Guard should remain in the National Capital Region to respond to credible threats against the Capitol,&#34; Smith and Rogers said. &#34;We appreciate our guardsmen answering the call to protect the Capitol, but it’s time for us to review what level of security is required, so they can return home to their families and communities.&#34;

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin 
overruled
 the chief of the National Guard Bureau with the decision to keep 2,280 National Guard troops at the U.S. Capitol, Fox News Channel reported exclusively on Thursday.
The costs of keeping the National Guard in the nation’s capital continue to skyrocket.
Spokesman Lt. Col. Robert Carver, in a statement, said the National Guard estimates the cost for the extension wil be $111 million.
&#34;After a review, we have revised our original January-to-March cost estimate of $482.8 million to $410 million due to under-execution,&#34; Carver siad. &#34;The new, projected cost estimate for the entire mission is $521 million.&#34;
PENTAGON CONSIDERS INVOLUNTARY ACTIVATION OF NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS FOR US CAPITOL SECURITY
That&#39;s more than Capitol Police&#39;s 2021 budget of 
$516 million
.
&#34;[W]e cannot ignore the financial costs associated with this prolonged deployment, nor can we turn a blind eye to the effects it will soon have on the National Guard’s overall readiness,&#34; Smith and Rogers said in their statement.
Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, laid out in a memo his assessment that the National Guard cannot and should not fulfill the Capitol Police&#39;s troop request at this time, making the case that the National Guard is already overstretched due to coronavirus constraints, civil disturbances and wildfires.

&#34;Efforts to date have not secured enough volunteers among supporting states to meet the USCP request of 2,280 soldiers, nor Option B of 1000 soldiers,&#34; the memo stated.

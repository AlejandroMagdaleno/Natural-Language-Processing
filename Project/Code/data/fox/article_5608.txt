Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., slams President Biden and his administration&#39;s &#39;naïve&#39; and &#39;weak&#39; response to the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack.
Sen. 
Lindsey Graham
, R-S.C., blasted the 
Biden
 administration for their &#34;unnerving&#34; response to the cyberattack that temporarily shut down the 
Colonial Pipeline
 and triggered gas shortages.
&#34;They&#39;re naïve, they&#39;re weak, and they don&#39;t show an understanding of the problem,&#34; Graham told &#34;
Fox News Primetime
&#34; Wednesday in response to comments made by President Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm.
Granholm told White House reporters Tuesday that if you drive an electric car, fuel shortages &#34;would not be affecting you, clearly.&#34;
&#34;That was the dumbest thing in the world,&#34; Graham told host 
Brian Kilmeade
. &#34;What if they take down the power company, the power unit you plug your car into? They&#39;re just disconnected. They don&#39;t understand prevention.&#34;
Graham also targeted President Biden&#39;s lack of a firm plan to avoid future 
cybersecurity
 attacks.
&#34;He should be saying we&#39;re going to prevent this in the future, we&#39;re going to have a national strategy to upgrade cybersecurity for critical infrastructure like financial services and energy,&#34; Graham said, suggesting incentives for companies who comply.
&#34;Reward them when they do by saying you can&#39;t be sued if you&#39;re attacked, if you&#39;re doing the right thing.&#34;
The 
FBI
 said Monday that ransomware gang &#34;Darkside&#34; was responsible for the attack, with President Biden remarking that evidence shows the hackers&#39; ransomware is in 
Russia

Graham called on the creation of a cyberterrorism law to give the U.S. authority to go against &#34;Darkside&#34; as if it were a terror organization.
&#34;Let&#39;s start holding Russia accountable for allowing this behavior to happen in their backyard with impunity,&#34; Graham said.

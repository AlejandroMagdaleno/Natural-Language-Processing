Embattled 
New York
 Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 told Fox News that former vaccine czar Larry Schwartz did a &#34;phenomenal job&#34; despite reports that Schwatz called county officials to gauge their loyalty to the scandal-plagued governor.
Cuomo was asked by Fox News’ Bryan Llenas on Monday about a Wall Street Journal report that the state Attorney General&#39;s Office is investigating Schwartz&#39;s alleged calls to three Democratic county executives. 
&#34;Larry Schwartz was a volunteer helping the vaccine effort on his own time,&#34; said Cuomo. &#34;And he did a phenomenal job. Former secretary to the governor. You look at all these sites, he and Kelly did all of it.&#34;
&#34;So he did a phenomenal job,&#34; the governor added. &#34;And I&#39;m totally confident in his performance.&#34;
CUOMO INVESTIGATION EXPANDED TO INCLUDE COVID VACCINE POLITICIZATION: REPORT
Schwartz was a volunteer adviser tasked with overseeing New York’s vaccine distribution efforts. He allegedly made calls on behalf of Cuomo questioning county executives on their &#34;loyalty&#34; to the embattled governor.
In the calls, Schwartz reportedly 
asked
 the county executives if they would be demanding Cuomo&#39;s resignation over sexual misconduct allegations. Schwartz has denied linking vaccine doses to political connections.

One of Cuomo’s accusers and a former staffer, Lindsey Boylan, accused Schwartz of engaging in a &#34;criminal abuse of power&#34; in a tweet on Monday.
&#34;Larry Schwartz is not a public servant,&#34; Boylan wrote. &#34;He is an enforcer who represents the worst of [Cuomo’s] corrupt administration. Linking life-saving vaccine access to political support for the governor is a criminal abuse of power.&#34;

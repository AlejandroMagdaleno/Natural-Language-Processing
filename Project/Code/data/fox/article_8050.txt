Vivek Ramaswamy, author of &#39;Woke In,&#39; warns that private companies like Facebook and Twitter can threaten liberty.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-
Vt.
, said Sunday &#34;there is a real danger&#34; congressional 
Democrats
 could fail to deliver on two major pieces of legislation furthering 
President Biden’s
 domestic agenda if moderates like Sen. Joe Manchin, D-
W.Va.
, cannot agree on the price tag.
Sanders has repeatedly said he would support progressive 
House
 Democrats who have vowed to block the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that passed in the 
Senate
 last month, if the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package that passed the House stalls in the Senate.
BIDEN DOUBLES DOWN ON $3.5 TRILLION PLAN THAT MANCHIN, MODERATE DEMS OPPOSE: &#39;NOT ABOUT SHORT-TERM STIMULUS&#39;
Asked by ABC&#39;s George Stephanopoulos whether Democrats could wind up with &#34;nothing,&#34; Sanders responded, &#34;That is a possibility and I think that would be a disaster for the American people.&#34;
&#34;There is a real danger that this bill will lose, that the infrastructure bill will lose in the House,&#34; the senator added.
Manchin of West Virginia said earlier Sunday on CNN’s &#34;State of the Union&#34; that he will not 
vote
 in favor of the budget reconciliation package, which is a central part of President Biden&#39;s Build Back Better agenda.
&#34;He will not have my vote on 3.5 and Chuck [Schumer] knows that,&#34; Manchin said, adding that it should be more like $1 trillion-$1.5 trillion. &#34;It’s not going to be three and a half I can assure you.&#34;
Manchin said there is &#34;no way&#34; the reconciliation bill will pass this month, and he said progressives are making a big mistake if they follow through on their threat to kill the infrastructure bill in retaliation.
&#34;They have to do what they have to do,&#34; he said. &#34;If they play politics with the needs of America, I can tell you America will recoil.&#34;
Sanders scoffed at Manchin’s $1.5 trillion price ceiling during an appearance on the same CNN show, saying most Democrats would have even supported his earlier suggestion of $6 trillion.
&#34;No. It’s absolutely not acceptable to me,&#34; he said. &#34;I don’t think it’s acceptable to the president, American people, or Democratic caucus.&#34; 
During a Sunday appearance on ABC&#39;s &#34;This Week,&#34; Manchin criticized Sanders for supporting the House Democrats who threatened to block the infrastructure bill.
&#34;I just respectfully disagree with Bernie,&#34; Manchin told Stephanopoulos. &#34;I’ve never seen this in legislation. I never thought the purposes of the progress we make in legislation was basically to hold one hostage over the other.&#34; 
Sanders fired back on the same ABC show, claiming that &#34;maybe the converse is true, and maybe Sen. Manchin is holding the reconciliation bill hostage.&#34;
Sanders added that &#34;the real question&#34; is whether it is &#34;appropriate for one person to destroy two pieces of legislation.&#34;

Sanders said that regardless of the party infighting, he expects both bills to eventually pass.
Budget reconciliation rules prevent Republicans from filibustering the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, so Democrats only need a simple majority to pass it. But with a 50-50 Senate, Democrats need every Democratic senator to vote yes, with Vice President Harris breaking the tie.

&#39;The Big Saturday Show&#39; panel weighs in on AOC&#39;s ineffectiveness while in Congress
U.S. Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y., met with one of 
New York City
’s leading 
Jewish
 groups last week for the first time since taking office in 2019 — putting an end to what some had called a snub. 
Ocasio-Cortez, now in her second term in Congress, told the head of the Jewish Community Relations Council, Michael Miller, she hadn’t yet met with city or statewide Jewish groups sooner because she has been &#34;focused on our backyard,&#34; the Jewish Telegraph Agency reported.
She said she has worked with smaller Jewish groups in the Bronx and Queens and the liberal nonprofit advocacy group J Street.

The Jewish Community Relations Council and the New York Board of Rabbis had expressed frustration that Ocasio-Cortez hadn’t met with the groups after she was first elected in 2018. She also pulled out of a memorial for assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin held by the Americans for Peace Now due to pressure by liberal groups, 
JTA 
reported. 
During the interview for the group&#39;s &#34;Congressional Conversations,&#34; the lawmaker told Miller she values the &#34;safety and the human rights&#34; of both Israelis and Palestinians and intimated that a two-state solution may be hampered by Israeli settlements.

Miller called the discussion with the New York congresswoman &#34;an opening&#34; and said the group would like to stay in contact with Ocasio-Cortez.

California congresswoman Katie Porter joins ‘America’s News HQ.’
Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif.,
 got called out on Monday after her office incorrrectly claimed she was the only single mother serving in 
Congress
.
The communications director for Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., who is also a single mom, flagged the claim in what appeared to be a fundraising email.
&#34;I am the only single working mother of young kids serving in Congress,&#34; the email read. &#34;I understand what it&#39;s like to have a million meetings in one day (that I&#39;m probably already late for) while also balancing childcare, school schedules, going to the grocery store, and so much more.&#34;

Mace&#39;s communications director, Natalie Johnson, tweeted a screenshot of the email. &#34;Fact check: 100% false,&#34; Johnson said. She signed the tweet as &#34;the employee of another single working mother of young kids serving in Congress.&#34;
Porter&#39;s office did not immediately respond to Fox News&#39; request for comment.
Mace has a 14-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter, according to the 
Washington Free Beacon

Texas
 Gov. Greg Abbott vetoed a portion of the state budget that funds the legislative branch on Friday, following through on a threat he made last month after Democratic lawmakers blocked a vote on a GOP-backed 
election bill
.
Abbott vetoed funding weeks after several Texas House Democrats 
walked off the floor
 and broke quorum before a planned vote on Senate Bill 7. As a result, lawmakers were unable to hold a vote on the election bill before the end of the legislative session.
&#34;Texans don’t run from a legislative fight, and they don’t walk away from unfinished business,&#34; Abbott said in a statement. &#34;Funding should not be provided for those who quit their job early, leaving their state with unfinished business and exposing taxpayers to higher costs for an additional legislative session. I therefore object to and disapprove of these appropriations.&#34;
Texas Democrats ripped Abbott when he first said he planned to veto funding, pointing out that the budget article also funds rank-and-file staffers such as clerical and maintenance workers.
House Democratic Caucus Chair Chris Turner told the 
Texas Tribune
 that the party &#34;is exploring every option, including immediate legal options, to fight back&#34; against Abbott’s decision.

&#34;Texas has a governor, not a dictator,&#34; Turner said in a statement to the outlet. &#34;The tyrannical veto of the legislative branch is the latest indication that [Abbott] is simply out of control.&#34;
Abbott has already indicated that he will convene a special session of the state legislature to vote on the election bill, which he has called a &#34;must-pass emergency item.&#34; Democrats have widely opposed the legislation.
If enacted, the bill would make sweeping changes to state elections by expanding the authority of partisan poll watchers, enacting bans on 24-hour and drive-thru voting, and increasing penalties for election workers who violate protocols.

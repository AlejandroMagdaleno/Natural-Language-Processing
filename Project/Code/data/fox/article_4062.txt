Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on the MLB moving the All-Star game to Colorado and the progressive backlash against his state’s election reform.
During an appearance on 
&#39;America Reports
&#39; Tuesday, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp ripped the 
Major League Baseball
 league for the &#34;discrepancy&#34; with respect to boycotting the Peach State over the election reform bill.
BRIAN KEMP: Yeah, I think they will. I mean, it&#39;s almost comical--just all of these hits that keep following: moving the All-Star game from a city that&#39;s, you know, a metro area that&#39;s 51 percent African-American to a metro area that&#39;s 10 percent African-American; that has less early voting days than Georgia has. They have 15. We have 17. They have a photo ID requirement for in-person voting as we do. 
...
I mean, it&#39;s insane...you compare where Major League Baseball is headquartered in New York, you know. I talked to that issue...about the discrepancies in how they&#39;re boycotting and pulling games out of a state like ours. Yet they&#39;re headquartered in a state that&#39;s more restrictive than we are. I mean, It just doesn&#39;t add up. And I will tell you, the people here and all over the country have figured this out. They are outraged and they are sick and tired of the cancel culture.

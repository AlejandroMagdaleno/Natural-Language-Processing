Rep. 
Ron Wright
, R-Texas, died Sunday at age 67 two weeks after being hospitalized with his wife Susan after testing positive for COVID-19, his office said Monday.
Wright, who had battled cancer for years, 
announced
 Jan. 21 that he was experiencing &#34;minor&#34; COVID-19 symptoms. He had been admitted to Baylor Hospital in Dallas.
He is survived by his wife Susan, his children Derek, Justin and Rachel, his brother Gary, and nine grandchildren, according to his office, which said he will be &#34;remembered as a constitutional conservative.&#34;
&#34;He was a statesman, not an ideologue,&#34; his office said. &#34;Ron and Susan dedicated their lives to fighting for individual freedom, Texas values, and above all, the lives of the unborn.&#34;

&#34;His wife Susan was by his side and he is now in the presence of their Lord and Savior,&#34; the Monday statement said.

Wright was hospitalized in September due to complications with his cancer treatments, which his office described as &#34;painful, sometimes debilitating.&#34; He was first diagnosed with lung cancer in 2018 and described it as a &#34;kick in the stomach&#34; to the 
Fort Worth Star-Telegram
.
&#34;As friends, family and many of his constituents will know, Ron maintained his quick wit and optimism until the very end,&#34; his office said. &#34;Despite years of painful, sometimes debilitating treatment for cancer, Ron never lacked the desire to get up and go to work, to motivate those around him, or to offer fatherly advice.&#34;
Wright had represented Texas&#39; 6th Congressional District since 2019. Wright found out he had been exposed to coronavirus shortly after the impeachment vote in the House and did not attend President Biden&#39;s inauguration on Jan. 20, the 
Texas Tribune
 reported.
Wright is the first sitting member to die after testing positive for coronavirus. Rep.-elect Luke Letlow, R-La., 
died
 in late December after contracting coronavirus at the age of 41.
Condolences for Wright&#39;s family poured in.

Theresa Sari, who lost mother in New York nursing home, joins &#39;Fox &amp;amp; Friends First.&#39; 
New York Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo
 fielded a question on why his family members received preferential treatment in getting tested for 
coronavirus
 in the early months of the pandemic, and gave a possible explanation as to why people like his brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, were able to get tested more easily than the general public.
During a Q&amp;A period following a budget briefing, WCBS 880’s Peter Haskell directly challenged the governor on the matter and asked what his role was.
CUOMO DIRECTED NY HEALTH OFFICIALS TO PRIORITIZE COVID-19 TESTING FOR HIS RELATIVES: REPORT
&#34;Was it appropriate for your family and friends to be tested for covid when others could not? Were you involved in this? Were you aware of it?&#34; Haskell asked.
Cuomo first responded by saying he did not wish to &#34;get ahead&#34; of the New York State Assembly’s investigation of the matter, but he then claimed that he &#34;was not involved in the testing program to that intimate level.&#34;

The governor did state, however, that his family members would have been tested if they met with him in his office.
&#34;People who I would meet with and I would be in exposure with, I was aware they were being tested,&#34; Cuomo said. &#34;So if you came to see me in my office you would be tested and that applied with my family also.&#34;

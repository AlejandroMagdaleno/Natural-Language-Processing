U.S. Senate candidate JD Vance says that Democrats massive spending bill is &#39;gasoline on the fire&#39; and won&#39;t solve any real problems. He also discusses the long-term impact of the crisis at the border and President Biden&#39;s performance in office.
Nearly seven in 10 parents with children under age 18 do not believe there should be a vaccine mandate for students, a new poll found. 
Asked if students in grades K-12 should be required to take the COVID-19 vaccine once eligible for the shot, 68% of respondents that have children under 18 said they do not believe the vaccine should be mandatory, according to a 
Quinnipiac University Poll
 released Wednesday.
Only 30% of respondents with children under 18 agreed that the shot should be mandatory, the poll found.

But the opinions of parents differed significantly from the overall population, with 52% of respondents overall saying the vaccine should not be mandatory for students once they are eligible, compared to 44% who said it should be a requirement.
The poll also showed that Americans now disapprove of 
President Biden&#39;s
 handling of the COVID-19 pandemic overall, with 48% of respondents saying they approve of the president&#39;s handling of the pandemic compared to 50% who say they disapprove.
The president&#39;s overall job approval rating was also underwater in the poll, with 38% saying they approve of the job the president has done compared to 53% who disapprove.
&#34;Battered on trust, doubted on leadership, and challenged on overall competency, President Biden is being hammered on all sides as his approval rating continues its downward slide to a number not seen since the tough scrutiny of the Trump administration,&#34; Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said of the numbers.

The discontent with Biden&#39;s job performance could also prove problematic for Democrats as the 2022 midterm elections approach, with Quinnipiac 
also showing
 that Republicans lead Democrats 47-44 in their latest generic 
congressional
 ballot poll.
&#34;Though the numbers are not overwhelming, they signal a potentially ominous trend for Democrats as a plurality of voters recommend tossing out the party that controls the House,&#34; Malloy said.

New York Post columnist Karol Markowitz on schools being closed during the coronavirus pandemic its impact on children.
New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz told &#34;
Fox &amp; Friends
&#34; on Wednesday that America is not following a &#34;sane&#34; strategy when it comes to children and the 
coronavirus
 pandemic, especially in regards to young children 
and mask-wearing
. In her 
new column
, Markowicz asked if &#34;COVID hysterics&#34; will ever let children live without masks and fully return to their pre-pandemic routines.
FAMILY KICKED OFF SPIRIT FLIGHT FOR TODDLER NOT WEARING MASK
KAROL MARKOWICZ: America is taking just the strictest [approach]. ... That&#39;s why every time you see footage of a toddler being dragged off a plane for not wearing a mask, that&#39;s happening in America. In Europe, they have to be sick to wear a mask on a plane. Now, six is still pretty young, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s crazy either. But you can reason with a six-year-old, it&#39;s pretty hard to reason with a two-year-old to wear a mask on a flight. 
...
We&#39;re just not doing the sane thing. And I think for smaller kids, especially for two-year-olds, three-year-olds; I have a two-year-old niece who has seen the world just masks throughout her whole life. 
...
It&#39;s very hard to get the cues and just pick up a language when everybody around you is masked when you yourself have to be masked at that age. So I think the sane path would be to get masks off kids right now. But for sure, once grown-ups start wearing masks and hopefully, we will soon, the kids follow. And just because they don&#39;t have a vaccine doesn&#39;t mean that they have to stay in masks for the rest of their lives.

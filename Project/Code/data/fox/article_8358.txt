Sen. James Risch, R-
Idaho
, claimed Tuesday that someone in the 
White House
 other than 
President Biden
 is &#34;calling the shots.&#34;
Risch made the comments during 
Secretary of State
 Antony Blinken’s hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations about the U.S. 
military
 withdrawal from 
Afghanistan
, which the senator called a &#34;dismal failure.&#34;
WHITE HOUSE ABRUPTLY CUTS FEED OF BIDEN MID-SENTENCE AS HE ASKS QUESTION AT WILDFIRES BRIEFING
&#34;One of the things we need to get to the bottom to is who is responsible for this? Who made the decisions?&#34; Risch said. &#34;[Biden] can’t even speak without someone in the White House censoring it or signing off on it.&#34;
The senator cited 
an instance Monday
 in which the White House abruptly ended the feed of Biden&#39;s briefing on wildfires with federal and state officials, cutting him off mid-sentence during a question to George Geissler of the National Association of State Foresters.
Risch said at Tuesday&#39;s hearing, &#34;This is a puppeteer act, if you would, and we need to know who’s in charge and who is making the decisions.&#34; 
BIDEN AGAIN SUGGESTS HE&#39;S NOT CALLING THE SHOTS: &#39;I&#39;M SUPPOSED TO STOP AND WALK OUT&#39;
&#34;There is not enough lipstick in the world to put on this pig to make it look any differently than what it actually is,&#34; he said later in the hearing, referring to the Afghanistan withdrawal. &#34;The American people want to know who is responsible for this?&#34;
&#34;Ultimately, the president makes the decisions,&#34; Blinken responded. &#34;As in every case, ultimately decisions that can only be decided by the president are decided by the president.&#34;
Risch again cited Monday’s incident in which Biden was cut off mid-sentence.
&#34;Somebody in the White House has authority to press the button and stop the president, cut off the president’s speaking ability and sound. Who is that person?&#34; the senator asked.
&#34;There is no such person,&#34; Blinken answered, adding that Biden &#34;speaks very clearly and very deliberately for himself. No one else does.&#34;
Questions have abounded over who Biden’s handlers are after multiple instances in which he implied he doesn’t set the rules for when and where he’s 
allowed to take questions
 from the press.

On Wednesday, 
he concluded remarks
 in honor of labor unions by saying he was &#34;supposed to stop and walk out of the room&#34; but decided to stick around anyway.
Biden 
has also said
, &#34;I’m not supposed to take any questions,&#34; admitted he was &#34;instructed&#34; to call on specific reporters, declared &#34;they gave me a list of people I’m going to call on,&#34; told reporters he would &#34;get in trouble&#34; if he didn’t follow orders and even said, &#34;I&#39;d be happy to take questions if that&#39;s what I&#39;m supposed to do.&#34;

&#39;Fox News Sunday&#39; host Chris Wallace discusses why Harris has not made the trip to the southern border.
&#34;
Fox News Sunday
&#34; host 
Chris Wallace
 joined 
Bill Hemmer
 and 
Dana Perino
 on 
&#39;America&#39;s Newsroom&#39;
 on Friday to discuss the 
Biden
 administration&#39;s response to the crisis at the 
border
.
WALLACE: Well, I don&#39;t know about priorities, but it doesn&#39;t seem that they have much of an answer to the crisis at the border, and maybe that&#39;s the reason that they&#39;re not they&#39;re not pushing it. 
...
And, you know, it&#39;s so interesting because when the president first said that he was putting 
Kamala Harris
, his vice president, in charge of the border, there was the sense was that he was putting her in charge of the border, the whole issue. And then a day or so later, the clarification came, well, no, she&#39;s not in charge of the border, she&#39;s in charge of diplomacy with 
Mexico
 and with the Northern Triangle countries to try to stem the flow to the border. And she&#39;s had a couple of phone calls with top officials in those countries, but she hasn&#39;t gone to the border and she hasn&#39;t gone to the Northern Triangle and she hasn&#39;t gone to Mexico, which kind of makes you wonder whether she knows this is a mess and doesn&#39;t want her fingerprints on it. 
...
I think we&#39;re way past the point where you can even pretend that this isn&#39;t a crisis at the border. It is. It&#39;s a humanitarian crisis. It&#39;s an 
immigration
 national sovereignty crisis. There&#39;s no two ways around it. The question is, what are you going to do about it?

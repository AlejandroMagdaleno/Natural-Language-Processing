Judge Curtis Evans joins &#39;America Reports&#39; to discuss the impact of illegal immigration on his community
Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
 has only tweeted about the situation at the border a handful of times since 
President Biden
 took office, compared to her dozens of tweets about the border -- including accusations that the GOP constructed &#34;mass concentration camps&#34; -- during the Trump administration.
&#34;This is not okay, never has been okay, never will be okay - no matter the administration or party,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez wrote on 
Twitter
 on Feb. 23 in response to a Washington Post story titled &#34;First migrant facility for children opens under Biden.&#34;
PSAKI USES ‘CRISIS&#39; TO DESCRIBE SITUATION AT THE BORDER, THEN WALKS IT BACK
&#34;It’s only 2 [months] into this admin [and] our fraught, unjust immigration system will not transform in that time. That’s why bold reimagination is so impt. DHS shouldn’t exist, agencies should be reorganized, ICE gotta go, ban for-profit detention, create climate refugee status [and] more,&#34; she 
continued

On the same day, Ocasio-Cortez responded to a Twitter user asking about how to deal with unaccompanied migrant children.
&#34;1 short term shift is requiring influx facilities w/ children to be licensed. Another issue is whether these services should be contracted out the way they are,&#34; she 
wrote
. &#34;And whether facilities w/ controversial records (ex. Homestead) should even be reopened.&#34;
During the Trump administration, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted about the terms &#34;cages,&#34; &#34;concentration camps&#34; and &#34;internment camps&#34; in relation to the border nearly two dozen times between February 2018 and July 2019.
&#34;The GOP has supported building mass concentration camps on the southern border. Kids &amp; families are dying. Now they want money for more - [with] ZERO negotiation on how $ is spent. We can’t do that. They‘ve shown that when they get more money, they build more camps.

,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez wrote on 
Twitter
 in June 2019, a year after former President Donald Trump signed an 
executive order
 ending the so-called family separation policy.
Ocasio-Cortez went viral in 2019 after 
previously unseen photos
 of her crying near a migrant detention center were released.

Migrant children are 
arriving
 at the U.S. 
southern border
 at rates faster than they can be processed and transferred to sponsor homes,  a senior Customs and Border Protection official told Fox News, all while the Biden administration has repeatedly denied that there is a &#34;crisis&#34; at the border,. 
Customs and Border Protection encountered 100,441 individuals in February, a 28% increase over January, the agency said. Of those, 19,246 individuals were in family units, 9,457 were unaccompanied children and 71,598 were single adults.

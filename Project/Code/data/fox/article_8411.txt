Representatives for Gab did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the situation. Twitter representatives said the platform did not take any enforcement action against Gab&#39;s account.
Gab describes itself as a &#34;social network that champions free speech, individual liberty and the free flow of information online.&#34; Critics have denounced the site as a haven for QAnon conspiracy theorists and other far-right extremists.
Google banned Gab from its Play Store in 2017, citing violations of its policy against hate speech. Apple blocked Gab from its App Store that same year.
Gab drew widespread scrutiny earlier this month after several outlets erroneously reported that former President Donald Trump had begun using the platform following his bans from Facebook, Twitter and other mainstream services. Gab CEO Andrew Torba later shot down the rumor in a blog post.

Torba recently said the site&#39;s 
user base surged
 after Trump&#39;s social media accounts were banned.
Tech platforms cracked down on content following reports that participants in the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol used online forums to coordinate their actions.

Several prominent conservative politicians, including Trump, have accused tech firms of censoring conservative voices.

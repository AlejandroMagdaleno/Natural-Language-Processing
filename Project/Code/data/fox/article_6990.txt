Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill with details after the vote to expel the highest-ranking GOP woman in U.S. government from her position.
House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi
 said she&#39;s feeling even more optimistic now about passing a &#34;big, bold&#34; spending bill this year after meeting with 
President Biden
 and congressional leadership at the 
White House
.
Pelosi, D-Calif., said Biden made a &#34;sincere&#34; commitment to finding a bipartisan agreement on legislation to rebuild the country&#39;s roads, bridges and more. While there are sticking points on how to pay for the investments and what should be defined as infrastructure, Pelosi said the &#34;positive&#34; meeting focused on finding common ground.
&#34;I felt optimistic about our ability to pass such a bill,&#34; Pelosi said Wednesday after the White House meeting. &#34;I&#39;m more optimistic now about being able to do so in a bipartisan way.&#34;

Pelosi highlighted two potential roadblocks. She doesn&#39;t agree with increasing user fees to fund the legislation, which Republicans want. (She backs Biden&#39;s proposal to increase taxes on the wealthy to fund improvements.) She noted that Democrats and Republicans disagreed on whether funding electric cars should be included in any package -- a further indication of the debates ahead on the scope of infrastructure spending.

Biden hosted the four bipartisan congressional leaders for the first time at the White House on Wednesday: Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. 
Biden proposed a $2.25 trillion phase-one infrastructure and tax plan, plus an additional $1.8 trillion spending plan on family infrastructure, such as free community college, universal preschool and a paid family and medical leave program.
Republicans, meanwhile, made a counteroffer of $568 billion in traditional infrastructure investments, though McConnell signaled he&#39;d be willing to 
spend up to $800 billion
. 
Biden proposes paying for the Phase 1 package by raising $2 trillion in taxes over 15 years on corporations so as not to drive up the national debt. The plan includes hiking the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, eliminating tax breaks for oil and gas companies and increasing the global minimum tax on U.S. corporations to 21% from 13%.
Republicans want to pay for their nearly $600 billion bill through user fees on electric vehicles and other items and repurposing unused coronavirus funds. 
The federal government ran an annual deficit of $3.1 trillion in the 2020 fiscal year, more than triple the deficit of the previous year, according to the 
Bipartisan Policy Center
. The cumulative national debt now sits at $28 trillion.
PROGRESSIVES THINK BIDEN&#39;S LATEST INFRASTRUCTURE FAMILIES PLAN ISN&#39;T BIG ENOUGH
Progressives want 
another massive spending plan
 and say the $4 trillion total that Biden proposed still falls short. Pelosi has a slim a seven-seat majority currently in the House and can only afford to lose three votes from her side if Democrats want to pass a bill without GOP support. But if Democrats open the door to a smaller package with Republicans, Pelosi risks losing some of her most liberal members, as well.

Pelosi summed up her strategy on the infrastructure bill, saying: &#34;Big, bold, as soon as we can [and] as bipartisan as possible.&#34;

McConnell and McCarthy also struck an optimistic tone about a bipartisan deal after leaving the White House as long as Democrats don&#39;t try to roll back the 2017 GOP tax cuts on corporations and wealthy individuals and narrow the scope of infrastructure spending to traditional physical structures.
&#34;We have to start with the definition of infrastructure,&#34; McCarthy said. &#34;... That’s roads, bridges, highways, airports, broadband – those are the places we can find common ground and work together.&#34;

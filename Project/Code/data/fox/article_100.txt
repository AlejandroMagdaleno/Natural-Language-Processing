House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. 
Adam Schiff
 said Sunday that 
President Trump
 should be barred from receiving intelligence briefings after he leaves office, an opportunity traditionally extended to former presidents.
&#34;There is no circumstance in which this president should get another intelligence briefing, not now, not in the future,&#34; Schiff told CBS&#39; &#34;Face the Nation.&#34; &#34;I don’t think he can be trusted with it now, and in the future he certainly can’t be trusted.&#34;
JAMES COMEY SAYS BIDEN SHOULD CONSIDER PARDONING TRUMP
Schiff claimed that U.S. intelligence partners withheld information because of Trump.

&#34;There were, I think, any number of intelligence partners of ours around the world who probably started withholding information from us because they didn&#39;t trust the president would safeguard that information and protect their sources and methods, and that makes us less safe,&#34; he said. &#34;We have seen this president politicize intelligence and that is another risk to the country.&#34;
Former FBI Director 
James Comey
, who was fired by Trump in 2017, echoed Schiff&#39;s sentiment during an appearance on ABC&#39;s &#34;The View&#34; on Friday.
The incoming director of national intelligence &#34;will have to take a very hard look at whether Donald Trump should be given information, including any information that might be sensitive to the security of the United States,&#34; Comey 
said
.
&#34;The guy&#39;s a lying demagogue who you can&#39;t trust,&#34; Comey said. &#34;You want to be very, very careful about what you give him.&#34;
JAMES COMEY ROASTED AFTER &#39;TODAY&#39; CONVERSATION: &#39;THIS IS SAD EVEN FOR NBC&#39;
&#34;I&#39;m hoping that he will have been stripped of the perks of a former president by being convicted by the U.S. Senate and barred from further participation in public office,&#34; he continued. &#34;Maybe that will be a reason for them to cut him off entirely.&#34;
Former principal deputy director of national intelligence Sue Gordon advocated barring Trump from post-presidency intelligence briefings in an op-ed in 
The Washington Post
 on Friday.
&#34;Every former president in the modern era has benefited from a unique national security perk after leaving the White House: routine intelligence briefings and access to classified information to support his continued involvement in advancing America’s interests. These briefings have been a matter of respectful convention and were granted by the new president to the old,&#34; Gordon wrote. &#34;My recommendation, as a 30-plus-year veteran of the intelligence community, is not to provide [Trump] any briefings after Jan. 20.&#34;

Gordon said Trump will be different from other former presidents because of his plans to stay highly involved in politics.
&#34;He leaves, unlike his predecessors who embraced the muted responsibilities of being a &#39;former,&#39; with a stated agenda to stay engaged in politics and policy. No departing president in the modern era has hinted at or planned on becoming a political actor immediately after leaving office,&#34; she wrote.

As 
coronavirus
 legislation hangs in limbo, the Democratic senator from the 
Mountain State
 is under intense pressure to back the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal pushed by the Democratic-held 
White House
 and lauded by his state&#39;s Republican governor. 
Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is a moderate with a reputation for working across party lines. And with little margin for error for Senate Democrats in a 50-50 chamber, he&#39;s being squeezed to vote with Democrats on an upcoming effort to pass coronavirus relief via budget reconciliation.
Last Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris pitched the White House&#39;s &#34;American Rescue Plan&#34; directly to West Virginians on 
WSAZ
, a station in the Huntingdon/Charleston, W.Va., market.
&#34;The American people deserve their leaders to step up and stand up for them,&#34; Harris said in the interview.

HOUSE STARTS WORK ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF TUESDAY AFTER PSAKI WARNS BIDEN WON&#39;T &#39;SLOW DOWN&#39; FOR REPUBLICANS 
But in a subsequent interview with 
WSAZ
, Manchin said he was left out of the conversation.
&#34;I saw [the interview]. I couldn’t believe it. No one called me [about it],&#34; he said. &#34;We’re going to try to find a bipartisan pathway forward, but we need to work together. That’s not a way of working together.&#34;
Then on Monday, Republican West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, who was previously a Democrat, echoed the vice president&#39;s call for a larger stimulus package in an interview with CNN.
&#34;Trying to be per se fiscally responsible at this point in time ... if we actually throw away some money right now, so what?&#34; he said. &#34;We have really got to move and get people taken care of.&#34;
The governor later doubled down in an interview on 
MSNBC
, calling on Congress to &#34;go big&#34; and continued his media tour with an interview with The 
Washington Post
. 
Manchin has been reluctant to sign on to President Joe Biden&#39;s proposal, saying stimulus payments must be more targeted.
&#34;Sending checks to people that basically already have a check and aren&#39;t going to be able to spend that or are not going to spend it, usually are putting it in their savings account right now, that&#39;s not who we are,&#34; he said in an interview with 
CNN
 last month. &#34;We have done an awful lot of that, it&#39;s time now to target where the money goes.&#34;

Meanwhile, a group of 10 moderate Senate Republicans is aiming to get Biden to bring down his $1.9 trillion ask and Monday put forward a plan that would cost just over $600 billion. Both the White House and the group of Republicans said a meeting on the proposal went well Monday. But White House press secretary Jen Psaki warned that Biden &#34;will not slow down work on this urgent crisis response, and will not settle for a package that fails to meet the moment.&#34;
Despite pressure mounting on the national and local levels – and from both sides of the aisle – on Manchin over how he&#39;ll vote if Democrats try to push through Biden&#39;s coronavirus relief proposal via budget reconciliation, he&#39;s so far not committed to doing so. 
Fox News asked Manchin&#39;s office Monday whether he would commit to backing Biden&#39;s plan if it&#39;s moved via reconciliation. 
&#34;Sen. Manchin is still committed to a bipartisan path forward,&#34; a spokesperson responded.

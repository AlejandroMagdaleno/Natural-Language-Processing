The Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence
 got called out Thursday after 
internet sleuths
 noticed some obvious photo editing on the cover of its latest demographic report.
What started off as a stock image showing a group of well-dressed professionals ultimately ended with a lady in a wheelchair and a blind man with a dog shoehorned in – supposedly signaling the department&#39;s diversity for its 2020 fiscal year report. 
The name of the primary stock photo: &#34;Portrait Of Multi-Cultural Office Staff Standing In Lobby.&#34; On Shutterstock, a stock photography company, the portrait can be 
downloaded for free
. 
Twitter users promptly spotted the edits. They seemed particularly suspect about the unbelievable shadow added to the blind man with a dog.

California,
 where the cost of a gallon of gasoline is more than $1 above the national average, increased its gas tax on Thursday. 
The increase is small - six-tenths of a cent - but brings the already highest-in-the-nation gas tax to 51.1 cents. 
The average cost of a gallon of gas is $4.28, compared to $3.10 across the U.S., according to AAA. 
The hike is part of a road repair bill the California legislature passed in 2017 that increases gas taxes and vehicle registration fees to pay for bridge and road repairs. The tax is increased based on the California Consumer Price Index.

When the bill took effect in November 2017, it raised the state’s gas tax by 12 cents. Prices went up another 5.6 cents in 2019 and 3.2 cents in 2020.

&#34;California already has the highest gas prices and highest gas tax in the nation, but Gavin Newsom and Sacramento Democrats didn’t think that was high enough,&#34; California GOP Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson said in a statement. &#34;Despite a budget surplus, Democrats ignored the calls for a Gas Tax Holiday, instead taking more from hard-working Californians who are simply trying to make their daily commute. Newsom’s California is oppressively unaffordable due to Democrat policies. We deserve a true leader who doesn’t think the answer to good governing is more taxes.&#34;

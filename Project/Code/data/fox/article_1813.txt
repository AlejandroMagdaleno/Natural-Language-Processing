The U.S.-Mexico border region in 
Arizona
 is becoming less secure since President 
Biden
 took office, a sheriff is alleging, according to a report.
&#34;We just built roads for the cartels,&#34; Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels said, according to the Washington Times.
Dannels explained that by halting work on the 
border wall
 championed by former President 
Donald Trump
, the Biden administration has left intact the high-speed roads that were built to help Border Patrol agents manage the region – but is failing to follow through with the barrier that was planned to keep 
illegal immigrants
 and smugglers of humans and drugs out of the U.S.

Cochise County covers 83 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, 
the report added

Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, told Fox News’ &#34;America’s Newsroom&#34; on Tuesday. &#34;The number of unaccompanied kids, the number of families that are coming in are just increasing every day. In my district, just a couple of days ago, 166 people [crossed the border. … So it’s not a crisis yet, but it’s going to get there very soon.&#34;

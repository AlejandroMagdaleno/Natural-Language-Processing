The

 super PAC American Bridge is encountering resistance in its attempt to punish AT&amp;T for financially supporting sponsors of the state&#39;s controversial

. 
The ad was advanced by the Corporate Accountability Project, a project of the super PAC and co-chaired by former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards. 
According to CNBC, the group&#39;s final ad submission included AT&amp;T&#39;s name. It read: &#34;AT&amp;T helped fund the anti-abortion politicians who wrote the dangerous law.&#34; It adds: &#34;Tell @ATT to get #Offthebanwagon.&#34;

It&#39;s a desperate move from the side losing the abortion debate in the court of public opinion.&#34;

Left-leaning activists have sounded alarm bells, warning that the high court&#39;s decision was a death knell for Roe.

&#34;It is deeply disappointing that AT&amp;T has taken such aggressive actions to silence its critics,&#34; said American Bridge vice president of strategic communications Julie McClain Downey.
&#34;For too long, companies have gotten away with lip service around empowering women, while simultaneously financing the anti-abortion extremists who wrote this bill, causing a reproductive health crisis in Texas. The public deserves to know about AT&amp;T’s hypocrisy and efforts to bury the truth.&#34;

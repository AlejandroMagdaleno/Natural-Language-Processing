Former US Secretary of Education, Dr. Bill Bennett says teachers unions have power over Biden and the Democrats. 
Former Secretary of 
Education
 Dr. Bill Bennet said Monday &#34;it is a scandal&#34; for many major public 
schools
 in the U.S. to continue to be shut down under President 
Joe Biden’s
 administration. 
&#34;It’s true now that a lot of kids may not see classrooms until September,&#34; Bennett said during an appearance on 
&#34;America’s Newsroom.&#34;
 &#34;This is a catastrophe for these kids, and there’s no beating around the bush on this.&#34; 
Bennett asserted that the U.S. could have a &#34;lost generation&#34; of children who will suffer academically, socially, and morally if a plan to return them to the classroom is not created soon.

He added that a loss of a year or more of schooling for American schoolchildren will continue to lead to a multitude of mental health conditions, including anxiety, alienation, and destructive behaviors, such as increased drug use. 
He also cautioned that teachers&#39; unions hold significant power over democratic policy and the Biden administration.
&#34;If Joe Biden calls up the head of the teachers’ union and says, &#39;I want you to do this,&#39; you know what they’ll say, &#39;we’ll think about it,&#39;&#34; Bennett said. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday said the adverse effects on children conducting virtual learning outstrip the threat of transmitting the virus during in-school learning, but the agency is not demanding that schools reopen.
&#34;There is more spread that is happening in the community when schools are not open than when schools are open,&#34; CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters, adding that if schools are closed there are lots of other risks such as lack of education, food insecurity, and missed milestones.

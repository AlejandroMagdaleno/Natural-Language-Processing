Youth climate activists on Monday descended upon House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi’s

Their final stop on their trek from Paradise, after visiting Senator Dianne Feinstein&#39;s, D-Calif., residence, was Pelosi’s mansion, where the protesters 
dumped ashes
 
from Butte County while leaving a mural with the words &#34;invest in us&#34; emblazoned on it, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.

Joy Lee, press secretary for Pelosi, told Fox News that the &#34;courage and resilience of the young climate activists marching for climate justice is an inspiration.&#34;
&#34;The climate crisis is the existential threat of our time and requires bold and immediate action, which is why House Democrats have presented the most ambitious, impactful and forward-looking climate response in Congressional history,&#34; Lee said.
Pelosi&#39;s spokesperson said the &#34;Democrats&#39; response includes passing historic bills&#34; targeting the reduction of pollution, investing in &#34;clean energy and lower global temperatures,&#34; and &#34;launching the Solving the Climate Crisis Action Plan, which is the boldest climate plan in history and called for the creation of the Civilian Climate Corps.&#34;
Lee added the climate crisis action plan will help with parks and conservation efforts as well as host &#34;global climate summits that put environmental justice front and center of the agenda&#34; around the globe.
BIDEN FALSELY CLAIMS $2T INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN WILL CREATE 16 MILLION JOBS
&#34;With 
President Biden
 in the 
White House
, 
Democrats’
 action will continue to accelerate – including as we work with the Administration to reach the goal of cutting carbon pollution in half by 2030 through the American Jobs Plan,&#34; Lee continued. &#34;Congressional Democrats support the goals of the Civilian Climate Corps and look forward to working with the Administration to enact it in the Jobs Plan.&#34;
&#34;They share the President’s commitment to robust workforce development and initiatives that connect workers to good-paying local jobs in industries focused on combating the climate crisis and protecting natural resources,&#34; she added. &#34;Environmental justice for all is a priority and a bedrock value for Democrats.&#34;
A spokesperson for Feinstein told Fox News the senator &#34;agrees with the views of the protestors that climate change is a critical threat to our world and that urgent action is needed to address it.&#34;
The Sunrise Movement did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta will launch the state&#39;s first Racial Justice Bureau, he announced 
Tuesday
.
The new division of the California&#39;s Department of Justice will be comprised of six attorneys and one supervising deputy attorney. 
California
 is not the first to create a unit of this kind — states including Vermont, Massachusetts, and Oregon already have racial justice branches.
SENATE PASSES ASIAN HATE CRIMES BILL WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT
Bonta says the impetus for the new bureau was the recent surge of anti-Asian hate crime. He will task the new team with addressing bias, hate organizations and hate crimes. 
But that&#39;s not all they&#39;ll do.
The bureau will assist California&#39;s Task Force to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans. They will help implement &#34;restorative justice&#34; in the classrooms and combat &#34;Campus Climate Issues&#34; to make school environments more &#34;equitable.&#34; 
The focus for now, however, will be the hate crime incidents. After all, hate crimes against Asian Americans went up 
150%
 in 2020 alone.
One of the bureau&#39;s goals is to train law enforcement to prevent, identify and report hate crimes. Bonta told the press Wednesday, however, that he&#39;s &#34;not hearing a lot of calls for more police to be on the street.&#34;
&#34;Communities are rising up saying, &#39;We can make ourselves safer&#39;,&#34; he said. 
SAN FRANCISCO MAN SUSPECTED IN MULTIPLE ATTACKS ON ASIAN VICTIMS TO BE CHARGED WITH HATE CRIMES: DA
When asked about specific solutions to allay the violence, Bonta suggested a &#34;senior escorting system&#34; in vulnerable areas like Chinatown.
This comes just one week after two Asian women were 
stabbed
 at a bus stop in San Francisco. And the same year as an elderly Asian resident was slammed to death in an Oakland driveway.
Other solutions Bonta presented include &#34;culturally competent services and more language access&#34;. 
This announcement comes only five days after Gov. Gavin Newsom&#39;s office was forced to reverse a directive to 
reduce California&#39;s driver’s license test 
by 25 languages, including Korean and Filipino, due to sharp criticism from the Asian American community.

State Senator David Min from Irvine pledged to formally request that Newsom undo this directive upon receiving word of it.
&#34;This is wrong, it’s unfair, it’s inequitable and it’s counterproductive,&#34; Min said.
Both the reversal of the DMV directive and the Racial Justice Bureau arrive amid a growing effort to 
recall
  Newsom over his mishandling of the coronavirus.  
Newsom&#39;s recall election is likely to be held this upcoming November.

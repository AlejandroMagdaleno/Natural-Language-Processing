Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., on Secretary Antony Blinken testifying on Afghanistan withdrawal.
A 
GOP
 
congressman erupted at 
Secretary of State
 Antony Blinken during his hearing in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, saying Congress does not &#34;need to hear lies.&#34;
Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., who lost both legs while serving in 
Afghanistan
, got into a heated exchange with Blinken as the congressman&#39;s allotted time to question the secretary of state drew to a close.
Mast slammed the administration&#39;s handling of the withdrawal, pointing to Biden&#39;s 
controversial leaked call
 with the former Afghan president, leading the Florida Republican to proclaim that he does not &#34;believe a word&#34; the secretary was saying. 
GOP REP. MCCAUL ASKS IF PUTIN THREATENED BIDEN, BLINKEN DODGES QUESTION
&#34;I don&#39;t want to hear from the secretary,&#34; Mast said. &#34;He lies to us when he appears before us.&#34;
&#34;I don’t want to hear the secretary,&#34; the congressman repeated himself. &#34;We don’t need to hear lies.&#34;
Mast also showed Blinken the pictures of the 13 U.S. service members killed in the Kabul suicide bombing while reading their names, ages and quotes from their families.
Republicans on the committee excoriated Blinken in his first of two hearings on the Biden administration&#39;s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. Multiple Republicans told Blinken 
he should resign
. 
Democrats, meanwhile, largely 
defended Blinken
 and the Biden administration during the hearing, with many Democrats blaming former President Trump instead.

Additionally, the secretary of state said that &#34;several thousands&#34; of green card holders remain in Afghanistan.

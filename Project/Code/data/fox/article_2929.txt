Radio Host Tony Katz and Former Biden Campaign Surrogate Kevin Walling discuss calls for NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo to resign and the impact of the governor&#39;s conduct on the Democratic Party.
A top aide to embattled New York 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo
 has resigned from her position following a damning report from the state&#39;s attorney general concluding that the governor had sexually harassed multiple women, according to multiple reports.
&#34;It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve the people of New York for the past 10 years,&#34; Melissa DeRosa said in a statement Sunday evening, adding that the past 2 years have been &#34;emotionally and mentally trying.&#34;
Earlier in the week, New York Attorney General Letitia James released an extensive report accusing Cuomo of sexual misconduct which prompted calls for the governor to resign including from President Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
DeRosa&#39;s departure was significant. 
She was seen as one of the governor&#39;s most competent and trusted top aides.
 The New York Times wrote that she stood by Cuomo &#34;for years even as his inner circle shrank in size and many of the top staffers who had helped first elect him in 2010 left the administration.&#34;
About two-thirds of state Assembly members have already said they favor an impeachment trial if he refuses to resign. Nearly all 63 members of the state Senate have called for Cuomo to step down or be removed.

More punishing news for the governor is expected Monday when an Assembly committee meets to discuss possible impeachment proceedings and &#34;CBS This Morning&#34; is scheduled to broadcast the first TV interview from an executive assistant who accused Cuomo of groping her breast.
Brittany Commisso, who was previously identified as &#34;executive assistant #1&#34; in the state attorney general’s report, is one of the 11 women who have accused Cuomo of sexual harassment.
&#34;I believe that he groped me, he touched me, not only once, but twice,&#34; she told &#34;CBS This Morning&#34; and the Albany-Times Union in a preview clip. &#34;And I don&#39;t think that that had happened to any of the other women. The touching, and I believe that because of what had happened to me, that that was the most inappropriate of the actions that he had done.&#34;

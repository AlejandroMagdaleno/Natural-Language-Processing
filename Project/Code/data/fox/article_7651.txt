North Carolina
 Congressman 
Madison Cawthorn
 joined a group of parents Thursday as they pushed back against the Buncombe County school board’s new mask mandate for children and what he called &#34;swampy backdoor tactics.&#34;
Cawthorn, who was born in in the county, spoke like any other citizen during the public comment portion – and he began by telling the board members that they would &#34;fit in&#34; in Washington, D.C.
&#34;Although that’s humorous, it is absolutely correct,&#34; he said. &#34;Because you have muzzled their voices just like you have muzzled our children.&#34;

Cawthorn accused the board of passing its new mask mandate without input from district parents who oppose such a rule.
&#34;You knew it would never withstand the scrutiny of the public,&#34; he said. &#34;I’ve witnessed swampy backdoor tactics from bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., but what you have done here today puts that all to shame.&#34;
He said the mask mandate amounted the board’s &#34;sacrifice&#34; of the emotional, social and psychologic development of district students &#34;on the altar of wokeness.&#34;
SCHOOL BOARD MEETING GETS HEATED AS PARENTS DEMAND MASK POLICY BE DROPPED
&#34;This school board has no right to rip personal responsibility away from the hands of its citizens,&#34; he said. &#34;The family should always come before the government. You do not know better than the parents in my district (North Carolina’s 11th Congressional District). You do not have a right to slam down mandates upon children of Buncombe County that fly in the face of scientific reasoning.&#34;
 He added that the greatest threat to schoolchildren today doesn’t come from the coronavirus.
&#34;It comes from woke government officials like you who think they are all-knowing and all-wise,&#34; he told the board, prompting applause from the audience.
Cawthorn said data shows few children are getting severe cases of COVID-19.

The board passed its new mask mandate in a 4-2 vote, according to the Asheville-based WLOS. 
&#34;Change is inevitable,&#34; Superintendent Dr. Tony Baldwin told the station. &#34;So, where we find ourselves today, certainly may not be where we find ourselves even 48 hours from now.&#34;
Of 33 speakers at the public comment session that followed, only one spoke up in favor of the mandate.
A full video of the board’s roughly three-hour meeting is available on its YouTube channel. Cawthorn begins speaking shortly before the 52-minute mark.

CNN sounded the alarm Monday over recent campaign blunders made by Democratic Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, suggesting his comments could jeopardize his already slim margins in the race against Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin. 
The POLITICO Playbook stated this week that Democrats have officially &#34;hit the panic button&#34; in Virginia’s gubernatorial race. 
&#34;This is the week Democrats officially hit the panic button in Virginia,&#34; Politico posted on Thursday. &#34;Biden won the state by 10 points in 2020, but Terry McAuliffe, the former popular governor looking to return to Richmond, leads Republican Glenn Youngkin by just 2.5 points (
48.1% to 45.5%
).&#34;
MCAULIFFE BOASTS HE&#39;LL &#39;BUILD EDUCATION&#39; IN WAKE OF SAYING PARENTS SHOULD HAVE LITTLE SAY
McAuliffe, a Democrat who was previously governor of Virginia from 2014 to 2018, led in the polls by as many as 9 points in early September 
according to Real Clear Politics
 but the gap has significantly tightened recently with polls showing him leading by just 1-3 points, within the margin of error.
McAuliffe and Youngkin have gone back and forth on several key issues including Critical Race Theory, which is a hot button issue in 
schools
 across Virginia. Youngkin has promised to remove the teaching, which promotes the idea the United States is fundamentally racist, from schools while McAuliffe has 
dismissed
 concerns about the curriculum as a &#34;racist dog whistle.&#34;

Lanhee Chen, fellow at the Hoover Institution joins &#39;Fox Report&#39;
Sen. 
Ben Sasse
, R-Neb., said the QAnon conspiracy theory is &#34;destroying the GOP from within&#34; and called out House Minority Leader 
Kevin McCarthy
 and newly elected Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in an op-ed Saturday.
&#34;Until last week, many party leaders and consultants thought they could preach the Constitution while winking at QAnon,&#34; Sasse wrote in 
The Atlantic
. &#34;They can&#39;t. The GOP must reject conspiracy theories or be consumed by them.&#34;
REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE VOWS TO FILE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST BIDEN
QAnon is a conspiracy theory centered on the baseless belief that President Trump is waging a secret campaign against enemies in the &#34;deep state&#34; and a child sex-trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals.

Sasse called Greene, of Georgia, &#34;cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs&#34; for supporting QAnon, although she&#39;s since 
rejected
 the movement. He criticized fellow Republican McCarthy for failing to &#34;disavow her campaign.&#34;
&#34;She 
once ranted
 that &#39;there’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out, and I think we have the president to do it,&#39;&#34; Sasse wrote. &#34;McCarthy failed the leadership test and sat on the sidelines.&#34;
TOM COTTON OPPOSED TO IMPEACHMENT TRIAL FOR TRUMP
The senator also criticized Greene&#39;s plan to 
file articles of impeachment
 against 
President-elect Joe Biden
 the day after the inauguration.
Greene responded to Sasse&#39;s op-ed during an interview with 11Alive on Sunday.
&#34;Your viewers are people in Georgia,&#34; Greene said. &#39;They don&#39;t care what Sen. Ben Sasse has to say. What they care about is their election integrity. They care about their votes not being stolen, and nobody gives a flip about Ben Sasse and what he has to say. He&#39;s a never Trumper, he&#39;s a turncoat Republican and our voters could care less about what he has to say about me or anyone else.&#34;
Sasse, who has been an outspoken Trump critic, drawing the president&#39;s wrath, did not say how he&#39;ll vote on impeachment.  The House voted to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6.
&#34;If and when the House sends its article of impeachment against Trump to the Senate, I will be a juror in his trial, and thus what I can say in advance is limited,&#34; Sasse wrote.  
 &#34;But no matter what happens in that trial, the Republican Party faces a separate reckoning. ... We can dedicate ourselves to defending the Constitution and perpetuating our best American institutions and traditions, or we can be a party of conspiracy theories, cable-news fantasies, and the ruin that comes with them.&#34;

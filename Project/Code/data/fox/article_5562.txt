Civil rights attorney tells &#39;Hannity&#39; the mayor appears &#39;on the side of criminals&#39;
Los Angeles
 civil rights attorney 
Leo Terrell
 joined 
&#34;Hannity&#34;
 and ripped Brooklyn Center, Minn., Mayor
 Mike Elliott&#39;s
 handling of the police-involved shooting death of a motorist earlier this week, claiming his actions make him seem like he&#39;s on the side of rioters ransacking the area the past few nights.
Terrell told  host 
Sean Hannity
 that Elliott&#39;s executive actions over the past 24 hours are irresponsible and have hurt the 
police department&#39;s
 ability to maintain civil order.
&#34;Sean, I saw this incompetent mayor basically tie the officers&#39; hands behind their back... That mayor is incompetent. Honestly, I felt he was working for the criminals because he basically is allowing his city to riot tonight. The police are basically defenseless.&#34;
&#34;What I&#39;ve seen in Minneapolis and Minnesota today is incompetence.&#34;
Elliott, the city&#39;s first Black mayor, who immigrated to the United States from Liberia as a child, took command authority of the Brooklyn Center Police Department upon a 3-2 city council vote, and saw the termination of City Manager 
Curt Boganey
 and resignation of Police Chief Tim Gannon. 
Boganey lost his job shortly after calling for &#34;due process&#34; for Kimberly Potter, the officer involved in the accidental shooting of Daunte Wright, 20, during an altercation in the midst of a traffic stop.
Elliott confirmed Tuesday
 that he ordered the removal of a pro-law-enforcement &#34;Thin Blue Line&#34; flag from outside the city&#39;s police precinct, calling the icon potentially inflammatory.
&#34;What I&#39;ve seen in Minneapolis and Minnesota today by that mayor&#39;s incompetence -- the chief of police quit and only because both the chief of police and the officer are both entitled to due process,&#34; Terrell fumed. 
During remarks Tuesday, Elliott advised that there are some cases in which officers do not need to be armed:
&#34;I dont believe officers need to necessarily have weapons every time they are making a traffic stop,&#34; 
he said.
On Monday night, anti-police rioters looted a Dollar Tree general store in Brooklyn Center, and all told 40 people were arrested, 
according to KTSP.
Elliott also asked Minnesota Democratic Gov. Timothy Walz to reassign Potter&#39;s investigation to the state&#39;s Democratic Attorney General Keith Ellison.
Walz himself 
drew criticism
 after reacting to Wright&#39;s death as, &#34;another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement.&#34;
Terrell added that Rep. 
Rashida Tlaib
, D-Mich., a liberal Democrat from Detroit, wrongfully called for the abolition of police and law enforcement earlier Tuesday -- in reaction to Wright&#39;s death.
Terrell said Tlaib is ignorant of the fact that only days ago, a 
Capitol Police officer was killed
 by a suspect in the line of duty.

&#34;What bothers me today not only about what she said is in the Capitol building, an officer gave his life to defend Tlaib, Congress, and America.&#34;
&#34;The Democrats don&#39;t want solutions, because if they had a solution they would lose this argument,&#34; he added.

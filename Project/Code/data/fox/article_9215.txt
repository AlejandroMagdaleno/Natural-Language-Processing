Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., provides insight into the Trump impeachment on ‘Fox News Sunday.’ 
Sen. 
Rand Paul
, R-Ky., described the looming 
impeachment
 trial of former President 
Donald Trump
 as a &#34;partisan farce&#34; and said that by Democrats&#39; logic, Senate Democratic Leader 
Chuck Schumer
 should face impeachment too.
&#34;If we&#39;re going to criminalize speech, and somehow impeach everybody who says, &#39;Go fight to hear your voices heard,&#39; I mean really we ought to impeach Chuck Schumer then,&#34; Paul told &#34;Fox News Sunday.&#34; &#34;He went to the Supreme Court, stood in front of the Supreme Court and said specifically, &#39;Hey Gorsuch, Hey Kavanaugh, you&#39;ve unleashed a whirlwind. And you&#39;re going to pay the price.&#39;&#34;
TRUMP WILL NOT TESTIFY IN &#39;UNCONSTITUTIONAL&#39; SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
&#34;This inflammatory wording, this violent rhetoric of Chuck Schumer was so bad that the chief justice, who rarely says anything publicly, immediately said this kind of language is dangerous as a mob tried to invade the Supreme Court,&#34; Paul continued.
Paul pointed out that he opposed the &#34;misguided notion of voting to overturn the election either with Congress or the vice president&#34; that Trump pushed. Still, he said that there is a &#34;zero&#34; chance that Trump will be convicted by the Senate.

&#34;People are going to have to judge for themselves ... are we going to potentially prosecute people for political speech?&#34; Paul said.
Paul also said that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts&#39; choosing not to preside over the Senate impeachment trial underscores its partisan nature. 
&#34;Justice Roberts said heck no, I&#39;m not coming across the street because you&#39;re not impeaching the president,&#34; Paul said. &#34;This was a strong signal to all of us that this was going to be a partisan hearing with a Democrat in the chair, who&#39;s already voted for impeachment.&#34;
Sen. Patrick Leahy, the president pro tempore of the Senate, is expected to preside over the trial instead.

&#34;The Constitution says the chief justice presides for a sitting president. So it was up to John Roberts whether he wanted to preside with a president who is no longer sitting, Trump, and he doesn&#39;t want to do it,&#34; Schumer 
said
 in January.

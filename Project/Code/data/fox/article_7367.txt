Former Hardee&#39;s executive offers analysis on &#39;The Story&#39;
White 
House
 
press secretary Jen Psaki was grilled Friday about 
President Biden’s
 poor polling numbers. 
Psaki placed at least some of the blame on Americans &#34;who&#39;ve decided not to get vaccinated.&#34; 
BIDEN DROPS TO 38% APPROVAL IN NEW NATIONAL POLL
&#34;I would say that this is a really tough time in our country,&#34; Psaki responded. &#34;We’re still battling COVID, and a lot of people thought we’d be through it, including us.&#34;
&#34;And because of the rise of the Delta variant, because of the fact that, even though it was a vaccine that was approved under a Republican administration, even though we now have full FDA approval, and even though it’s widely available across the country, we still have … 20% of the country who&#39;ve decided not to get vaccinated,&#34; she added.
&#34;No question that’s having an impact,&#34; Psaki said, before concluding, &#34;And of course, as the president has said, the buck stops with him.&#34;

President Biden addressed the report Friday and defended his record on the economy as &#34;progress&#34; as his approval rating teeters at 38%.
&#34;In total, the job creation in the first eight months of my administration is nearly five million jobs,&#34; Biden said. &#34;Jobs up, wages up, unemployment down. That&#39;s progress.&#34;

Republican U.S. Sen. 
Ben Sasse
 is facing more opposition in his home state of 
Nebraska
 for criticizing former 
President Trump
.
Last week the local Republican Party in the state&#39;s largest conservative county reportedly voted to help other counties in their bid to censure Sasse, 48, a Nebraska native who has served in the Senate since 2015.
Sarpy County Republicans voted 2-1 Thursday to join Scotts Bluff and Hitchcock counties to officially condemn Sasse for attacking Trump’s unsuccessful efforts to overturn the election results and for claiming Trump helped incite the Jan. 6 riot 
at the U.S. Capitol
, the Omaha World-Herald reported. 
Sasse, who easily won reelection in November, is a vocal critic of the former president and has been censured by his home state before.
Robert Anthony, a Sarpy County resident, voted for censure.
SASSE HITS BACK AT STATE GOP AMID CENSURE ATTEMPT: &#39;POLITICS ISN&#39;T ABOUT THE WEIRD WORSHIP OF ONE DUDE&#39; 
&#34;Sasse says he’s just here to defend the Constitution, but Sarpy Republicans feel like people are trampling on the Constitution all the time,&#34; Anthony said.

Anthony said he and other Nebraska Republicans believe Sasse opportunistically supported the then-president until Sasse won his Senate primary, then the senator went back to criticizing Trump.
Sarpy County&#39;s censure proposal focuses on what it called Sasse’s &#34;character attacks,&#34; according to the World-Herald.
SASSE SAYS THERE IS &#39;BROKENNESS&#39; IN TRUMP&#39;S SOUL
Sasse, undeterred by the threat, defended himself in a video that was released Thursday and addressed to members of the Republican State Central Committee. The committee will vote Feb. 13 on whether to censure him.
&#34;You are welcome to censure me again,&#34; Sasse says in the video, &#34;but let’s be clear about why this is happening. It’s because I still believe, as you used to, that politics isn&#39;t about the weird worship of one dude.&#34;
&#34;Let&#39;s be clear: The anger in this state party has never been about me violating principle or abandoning conservative policy ‒ I&#39;m one of the most conservative voters in the Senate ‒ the anger&#39;s always been simply about me not bending the knee to one guy,&#34; Sasse emphasized. &#34;Personality cults aren’t conservative. Conspiracy theories aren’t conservative. Lying that an election has been stolen is not conservative.&#34;

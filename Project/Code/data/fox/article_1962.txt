Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany explains why she thinks the Biden administration is denying the media access to migrant facilities at the border. 
Former White House press secretary 
Kayleigh McEnany
 slammed the 
Biden administration
 Tuesday for what she described as an &#34;unprecedented&#34; lack of 
media access
 to the 
border
. 
McEnany, a Fox News contributor, argued on &#34;
Outnumbered
&#34; that the administration is denying access to migrant holding facilities because &#34;what we’re hearing from the podium is very different from the pictures on the ground&#34; and the administration knows that the press and cameras &#34;would expose that.&#34;
Some members of the 
media
, including those from left-wing 
CNN,
 have called out the administration for seemingly hiding what many believe to be a crisis of the White House&#39;s own doing.
&#34;We are working on independent press coverage,&#34; current White House press secretary 
Jen Psaki
 told reporters Monday. &#34;We believe that that should happen and that should be the case.&#34;
MIGRANT SAYS HE CAME TO US BORDER BECAUSE BIDEN WAS ELECTED, WOULD NOT HAVE TRIED TO CROSS UNDER TRUMP
&#34;I don’t pull the levers here. I wish I was that all powerful, I am not, but I could just reiterate our commitment to transparency and I certainly hope to have an update for you very soon, but I can’t give you a deadline on that,&#34; she continued.
&#34;This administration is setting an unprecedented tone here in 
not allowing ride-alongs,
 not allowing press access,&#34; McEnany said Tuesday before discussing Psaki&#39;s claim that &#34;the vast majority&#34; of migrants coming to the border &#34;are turned away.&#34;
&#34;That is the message we will continue to covey and the president has also conveyed that directly, as has the secretary of Homeland Security,&#34; Psaki said. &#34;The border is not open, and the majority of people are turned away.&#34;
McEnany cited a recent 
Axios story 
 that reported &#34;in the last week, if their reporting is accurate, only 
13% 
of families were being turned away and the other 87% were going into the United States to have their cases adjudicated.&#34;

&#34;That is very different than what we’re hearing from the podium,&#34; McEnany stressed, adding that if the media was allowed access, people would see &#34;families being processed.&#34; 
&#34;There is a very different reality on the ground,&#34; McEnany said. &#34;Pictures are very powerful and that’s why they are banning the press.&#34;

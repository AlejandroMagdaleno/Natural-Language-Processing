 Karl Rove
 said Wednesday that 
President Joe Biden
’s inaugural address was a &#34;heartfelt appeal for unity.&#34;
Biden was sworn in as the 46th President of the United States and used his inaugural address to call on Americans of all stripes to unite.
Biden vowed to be a president to &#34;all Americans&#34; as he and Vice President
 Kamala Harris
, took the oath of office at the U.S. Capitol.

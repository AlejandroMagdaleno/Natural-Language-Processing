Fox News correspondent Casey Stegall has the latest on conference speakers on &#39;Special Report&#39;
Texas
 Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick vowed Friday to never let the state turn 
Democratic
, calling the state the &#34;last man standing&#34; electorally against future Democratic presidential candidates. 
&#34;There are a lot of conservative and red states around the country, but if we fall, America falls,&#34; Patrick told the audience on the opening night of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Dallas. &#34;The electoral votes of New York, California …combined together means we could never elect a conservative Republican to the White House ever again.&#34;
Texas has 38 electoral votes, the most of any reliably Republican state and the second-most of any state next to California, which is a reliably Democratic state with 55 electoral votes.
Texas last voted for a Democrat in a presidential election in 1976, when Jimmy Carter beat Gerald Ford.
TEXAS BATTLE OVER VOTING ACCESS BILL ENTERS ROUND TWO
But the gap has narrowed in recent elections: In November 2020, former 
President Trump
 beat Democrat 
Joe Biden
 by less than 6 percentage points, down from Trump&#39;s 9-point advantage over Hillary Clinton in 2016. The last four presidential elections before that in Texas were double-digit wins for the Republican candidates. 
Democrats spent millions of dollars in Texas last year in a failed attempt (once again) to flip the state, hoping that Latinos and suburban voters would cast ballots for Biden. But that never materialized. 
&#34;I can tell you that as the lieutenant governor of this great state that I’m blessed and honored to serve, we’re not ever going to let that happen,&#34; Patrick said. 
He said Texas stood &#34;ready to fight for everything you hold dear wherever you live in America&#34; and promised in 2024 that &#34;Trumpsim will rise again!&#34; 
Patrick praised Trump, who will speak at the conference Sunday afternoon. 
&#34;His policies will live on forever. He has taught America to stand up and fight for this nation,&#34; Patrick said.

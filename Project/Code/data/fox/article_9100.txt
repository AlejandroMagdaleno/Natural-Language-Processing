Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., discusses the sexual harassment allegations against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Republican 
Rep. Lee Zeldin 
of 
New York
 says he’s &#34;actively exploring&#34; a run for governor next year as embattled Democratic 
Gov. Andrew Cuomo
 faces multiple allegations of sexual harassment as well as a federal probe into the state’s handling of COVID deaths at nursing homes amid the 
coronavirus pandemic.
&#34;With his nursing home cover-up &amp; abuse coming more to light, it&#39;s clear 
#CuomosGottaGo
. As a NYer, I can&#39;t sit back as Cuomo attacks our freedoms, our wallets &amp; our safety. After many msgs of encouragement &amp; discussing w/ my fam, I’m actively exploring a 2022 run for Gov of NY,&#34; Zeldin – a four-term congressman who represents the eastern half of New York’s Long Island – tweeted on Tuesday.
FIRST ON FOX NEWS: ZELDIN ENCOURAGED TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR
 
In an interview with Fox News  couple of hours later, Zeldin reiterated that &#34;I am now actively exploring the race for governor.&#34;
&#34;I believe that Republicans will retake the House in 2022, so with the reality that if I run for governor I’m not going to be running for re-election to the House, I only want to make that run if it’s a run we can make and win,&#34; the congressman emphasized. 
&#34;If the calls go the way all these texts, emails and calls have gone in recent days and weeks of people reaching out, I’m only going to grow more encouraged and motivated that New Yorkers are ready for a change,&#34; he noted.
Zeldin said his next step will be to make &#34;phone calls all across the state to talk to Republican Party and Conservative Party leaders, elected officials, former elected officials, others who might be in leadership positions in law enforcement, veterans groups, other organizations, to get everyone’s thoughts and perspective on a candidacy.&#34;
He stressed that &#34;nothing motivates me about the idea of finishing in second. I enjoy what I do in the House. I’m in my fourth term. I’m moving up in seniority.&#34;
&#34;I only want to make that run if it’s a run we can make and win. If the calls go the way all these texts, emails and calls have gone in recent days and weeks of people reaching out, I’m only going to grow more encouraged and motivated that New Yorkers are ready for a change,&#34; he said.
Fox News was first to report two weeks ago that Zeldin was being encouraged by prominent Republican leaders and donors to launch a gubernatorial campaign.
Zeldin, an attorney and officer in the U.S. Army Reserve,  was first elected to the Suffolk County congressional district in 2014. He was a staunch ally and defender of President Trump during his four years in the White House.
LIVE UPDATES FROM FOX NEWS ON THE CUOMO CONTROVERSY
Zeldin said he&#39;s talked with Trump &#34;since he’s left the White House on a whole host of topics.&#34; 
Asked if he&#39;s seeking Trump&#39;s endorsement, Zeldin said &#34;I’m confident that if I ran I’d have his support, but I don’t want to speak for him.&#34;
While New York is a reliably blue state where Cuomo won reelection to a third term in 2018 by a massive 23-point margin, the governor has been politically wounded by the state’s current nursing home 
COVID crisis.
 Cuomo, who last year initially won national praise from Democrats and the media for his efforts battling the pandemic, suffered serious political fallout in recent weeks from revelations that his administration concealed the full extent of nursing home-related deaths during the COVID crisis.
And that was before allegations of sexual harassment in recent days from three younger women – including two former Cuomo aides, made national headlines. New York Attorney General Letitia James has opened a probe into sexual harassment accusations against Cuomo. On Monday, Democratic Rep. Kathleen Rice of New York called on the governor to resign.
GOP REP. REED SAYS HE&#39;S &#39;DEFINITELY LOOKING&#39; AT NY GUBERNATORIAL RUN
Zeldin isn’t the only Republican member of Congress from New York who’s mulling a gubernatorial bid. Rep. Tom Reed – who represents a district in the western edge of the state - told Fox News two weeks ago that he’s &#34;definitely looking&#34; at running for governor in 2022. And Reps. Elise Stefanik, a rising star in the party, has not ruled out a bid.

Fox Nation host Lawrence Jones reacts to the speakers and messages from the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida.
Conservatives appear energized and united at the annual 
Conservative Political Action Conference
 (CPAC) in Florida, 
Fox Nation
 host Lawrence Jones said on Friday, offering insight on what former President Donald Trump will say in his weekend address.
&#34;I thought that it was going to be a time of mourning and a time of regrouping, but I think there&#39;s a lot of energy here,&#34; Jones told &#34;
America’s Newsroom
,&#34; live from CPAC.
&#34;You&#39;ve got people that are from all across the country and, of course, because they had to limit the amount of people they were going to be here, but they&#39;re fired up. And I honestly thought before I got here, all this talk about there being a civil war? I really don&#39;t think there is a civil war,&#34; Jones said.
LIVE UPDATES: CPAC 2021 SPEAKERS TRUMP JR., TED CRUZ APPEAR IN FLORIDA AS CONFERENCE RAMPS UP
While attending CPAC, Jones said that there only seems to be a &#34;war&#34; between the leaders in the conservative movement. However, the people &#34;seem very unified on a message and are very frustrated with the loss from last year.&#34;
Jones went on to say, &#34;And they are willing to go on the line and say what values matter to them and they want their candidates to fall in line. So again, I think this civil war talk is among the leaders, but not with the people. They seem to be unified on a pretty concise message.&#34;

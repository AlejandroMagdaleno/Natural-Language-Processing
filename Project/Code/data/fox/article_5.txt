Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discusses the importance of electing officials who will ‘protect American interests’ amid fallout from the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.
A three-year-old boy from 
California
 is among the American citizens left behind amid the Biden administration&#39;s withdrawal from 
Afghanistan
 according to a report from ABC 7 San Francisco, as the 
State Department
 acknowledges as many as 200 Americans may have been abandoned when the final U.S. plane left Monday.
The report said the boy is a U.S. citizen born near Sacramento, but hid the identity of the child and his family who are stuck in the Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The child&#39;s family members are all U.S. permanent residents, according to the outlet. 
A veterans advocate told ABC 7 San Francisco that Rep. Jackie Spierer, D-Calif., wrote a letter asking for the family&#39;s safe passage to the Kabul airport but that the family was stopped by the Taliban on their way and beaten. Spierer&#39;s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News.

ABC 7 San Francisco also 
reported
 that as of Monday the boy&#39;s family had met with other Americans aiming to flee Afghanistan without the help of the U.S. government.
The White House did not directly address the situation of the boy and his family when reached by Fox News for comment. A spokesman referred to Secretary of State Anthony Blinken&#39;s speech Monday night.
&#34;We believe there are still a small number of Americans -- under 200 and likely closer to 100 -- who remain in Afghanistan and want to leave,&#34; Blinken said. &#34;We&#39;re trying to determine exactly how many… We will keep working to help them. Our commitment to them has no deadline.&#34;

The fact American forces left Afghanistan with some still stranded in the country Monday appears to mark a 
broken promise 
for President Biden. He told 
ABC News
 earlier this month that &#34;if there&#39;s American citizens left, we&#39;re gonna stay to get them all out.&#34;

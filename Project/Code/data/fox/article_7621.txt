Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, was fined $5,000 for bypassing the metal detectors that were 
installed
 following the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
Crenshaw reportedly refused to go through the detectors, which means the fine will be deducted from his paycheck, according to a Sept. 29 
press release
 from the House Committee on Ethics.
&#34;On September 27, 2021, the Committee received a notification from the Office of the Sergeant at Arms that Representative Dan Crenshaw has been fined pursuant to House Resolution 73.  Pursuant to Section 1(a)(3) of House Resolution 73, the Committee hereby publishes the fine notification,&#34; the committee said.
&#34;The Committee notes that the mandatory publication of a fine notification does not itself reflect any judgment on behalf of the Committee.&#34;

The metal detectors have been an ongoing 
source of contention

Crenshaw blasted the metal detectors and their related fines as a useless virtue signal at the time, saying, &#34;When you&#39;re a liberal there’s a propensity for action, even if that action is not effective. There’s a propensity for virtue-signaling even when that signaling is not effective.&#34;

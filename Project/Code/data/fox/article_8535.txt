The 
State Department
 responded to calls for impeachment Friday by reaffirming

Afghanistan
.
&#34;Blinken is focused on one thing and one thing only: the evacuation of American citizens and our allies and partners,&#34; spokesperson Ned Price said in a statement provided to Fox News.

Biden said
 Thursday night.

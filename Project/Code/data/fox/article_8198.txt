Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., argued pursuing impeachment of President Trump after he leaves office will &#39;further divide the country.&#39; 
Sen. 
Lindsey Graham
, R-S.C., argued on Sunday that pursuing the &#34;Scarlet Letter&#34; 
impeachment
 of 
President Trump
 after he leaves office will ruin the start of 
Joe Biden&#39;s
 presidency and urged the president-elect to &#34;stand down.&#34;
Speaking during an interview on &#34;
Sunday Morning Futures
,&#34; the South Carolina Republican senator pressed Biden to oppose the impeachment push.
&#34;You talk about 
unifying the country
, if you do not stand up against the impeachment of President Trump after he leaves office, you&#39;re an incredibly weak figure in American history,&#34; Graham said.
Graham stressed that he believes pursuing impeachment after Trump leaves office &#34;will further divide the country.&#34;
He went on to urge Biden to &#34;stand up to the radical left&#34; and tell Senate Minority Leader 
Chuck Schumer,
 D-N.Y., to dismiss what he believes is &#34;an unconstitutional attempt to impeach president Trump out of office.&#34;
On Sunday, Graham tweeted the letter he sent to Schumer saying, &#34;The Senate should vote to dismiss the article of impeachment once it is received in the Senate,&#34; stressing that &#34;we will be delaying indefinitely, if not forever, the healing of this great Nation if we do otherwise.&#34;
Graham told host 
Maria Bartiromo
 he has not yet heard back from the Democratic senator. Fox News did not immediately hear back from Schumer’s office.
Graham said impeaching a president after he leaves office is &#34;insane at every level&#34; and stressed that it &#34;will create further division in this country.&#34;
&#34;This is a Scarlet Letter impeachment where the Democrats are trying openly to disqualify President Trump from ever holding office again after he leaves office,&#34; Graham said. &#34;This has never been done in the history of our country.&#34;
He went on to say that he believes &#34;it is blatantly unconstitutional.&#34;
&#34;It’s being driven by the radical left and what is Joe Biden doing? He&#39;s sitting on the sidelines and doing nothing,&#34; Graham said. &#34;One phone call from President-elect Biden would stop this.&#34;
Graham added that &#34;Joe Biden is off to a lousy start,&#34; saying that &#34;it would be so easy for him in the name of healing this country to tell Schumer to stand down impeachment.&#34;
Graham went on to say that because Biden is not doing that he is &#34;really worried that he&#39;s [not] going to stand up to the radical left on anything.&#34;
&#34;I think we’re going to have in the first hundred days by the Biden administration the most aggressive socialized policy effort in the history of the country,&#34; he continued.
Ten House Republicans
, including 
Rep. Liz Cheney
 of Wyoming, joined 
Democrats
 to impeach President Trump on charges of &#34;incitement of an insurrection,&#34; making him the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice. 
Cheney, the No. 3 
House
 Republican, 
faced blowback
 from other GOP leaders for her high-profile condemnation of the president. 
On Sunday, Graham also had a message for his Republican colleagues in the Senate saying, &#34;If we embrace an unconstitutional impeachment of Donald Trump after he&#39;s out of office, it will destroy the party.&#34;
&#34;President Trump’s going to be the most important voice in the Republican Party for a long time to come,&#34; Graham said, adding that Trump will &#34;accept responsibility for his part on January the 6th.&#34;
He went on to say that impeaching Trump after he leaves office is &#34;not only unconstitutional,&#34; but it will &#34;destroy&#34; the Republican Party.
&#34;I hope the Republican senators know that because it is a reality and it will not help the country,&#34; Graham said, adding that impeaching Trump after he leaves office &#34;will be disastrous for this country and our party.&#34;
Graham did, however, acknowledge that the 
violence at the U.S. Capitol
 earlier this month &#34;was one of the low points in my time in office.&#34;
&#34;It was horrendous to see people come and take over the capitol, the House and the Senate, beat officers, defile the seat of government,&#34; Graham said, adding that Congress will &#34;get to the bottom&#34; of how that could have happened.
He then urged his Republican colleagues not to &#34;legitimize an unconstitutional effort to impeach President Trump&#34; because it will become &#34;the model for the future.&#34;
&#34;What you’ve done here is you impeached the president without one witness being called and not even having a lawyer,&#34; he added, noting that the &#34;bad, rushed [and] emotional&#34; move is &#34;dangerous to the presidency.&#34;
&#34;I hope every Republican will reject the second impeachment of President Trump,&#34; he stressed.
Graham also noted on Thursday that &#34;there are a lot of people 
urging the president to pardon folks
 who participated in defiling the Capitol.&#34;
&#34;I don&#39;t care if you went there and spread flowers on the floor, you breached the security of the Capitol, you interrupted a joint session of Congress, you tried to intimidate us all, you should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and to seek a pardon of these people would be wrong,&#34; Graham said, adding that he thinks &#34;it would destroy President Trump, and I hope we don&#39;t go down that road.&#34;
Among those requesting a pardon from President Trump before he leaves office this week is the attorney representing the so-called &#34;QAnon Shaman,&#34; who stormed the U.S. Capitol in a bizarre getup, 
The New York Post reported
.
Graham noted that rioters chose to storm the U.S. Capitol and that &#34;President Trump never said go into the Capitol and try to interrupt a joint session of Congress.&#34;

Graham stressed that &#34;that was the choice they made&#34; and now the rioters need to face the consequences.

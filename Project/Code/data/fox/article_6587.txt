CALIFORNIA&#39;S NEWSOM SNAPS IN INTERVIEW: ‘EVERYBODY OUTSIDE THIS STATE IS B----ING ABOUT THIS STATE’
Newsom slammed Elder in a fundraising email Thursday, saying that Elder and 
former President Donald Trump
 are one and the same. 
&#34;If this guy is governor during Delta it would lead to extraordinary suffering,&#34; Newsom claimed in a fundraising email that made the rounds on social media. &#34;His anti-science approach would move our planet backward in the race against a changing climate. He would be a disaster for California.&#34;
The email also referred to Elder as &#34;Larry Trump.&#34;
House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also attacked Elder, saying Wednesday that it would be &#34;a disaster&#34; if he wins. 
&#34;The recall in California is a GOP power grab. If it were to succeed, Larry Elder might become governor,&#34; Schiff wrote on Twitter. &#34;That would be a disaster: He’s anti-truth. Anti-science. Even anti-minimum wage.&#34;
&#34;And after Trump, what Californian would want another TV/radio personality running anything?&#34; Schiff added.
Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, another Democrat, also attacked Elder, comparing him serving as governor to the delta variant of COVID-19.

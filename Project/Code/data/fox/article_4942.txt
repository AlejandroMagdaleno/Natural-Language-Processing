George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley says there are good faith arguments to be made for post-service impeachments, but also notes there are significant countervailing costs.
George Washington University law professor
 Jonathan Turley
 argued on Monday that there is some value in a post-service 
impeachment trial 
in terms of dialogue and addressing the issues raised, but there are also &#34;very significant&#34; countervailing costs.
Turley went on to say that holding an impeachment trial after a president leaves office is &#34;a very difficult argument to make in my view given the language of the Constitution.&#34;
Turley made the points on &#34;
The Faulkner Focus
&#34; one day after his 
Fox News op-ed
 was published titled: &#34;Trump impeachment trial – why his best defense may be no defense.&#34; 
JONATHAN TURLEY: TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL-WHY HIS BEST DEFENSE MAY BE NO DEFENSE
&#34;It is the future of the Constitution, not 
Donald Trump
, that most concerns me as the 
Senate 
is about to try to remove a president who has already left office,&#34; Turley wrote. 
&#34;On its face, the planned impeachment trial is at odds with the language of the 
Constitution,
 which expressly states that removal of a president is the primary purpose of such a trial,&#34; he continued.
 &#34;At the time, Trump will be neither a president nor in office. He will be a citizen and would be best served legally to forgo the trial entirely as extraconstitutional and invalid.&#34;
Some Republicans are 
arguing
 that the Senate cannot hold an impeachment trial once a president leaves office. Trump, his legal team, or Trump-aligned senators may even try to have a court declare that to be the case. But it&#39;s unlikely that the courts will weigh in on such a heavy constitutional question that is so intertwined with checks and balances provided to another branch.
Chuck Schumer
, the soon-to-be Senate majority leader, has made clear there will be a trial.
&#34;There are good-faith arguments to be made for a retroactive impeachment or post-service impeachment,&#34; Turley noted on Monday, stressing that it is an &#34;unresolved issue.&#34;

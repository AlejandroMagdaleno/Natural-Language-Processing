The 
Senate
 Judiciary Committee on Thursday advanced 
President Biden&#39;s 
nominee to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms
 (ATF) on a party-line vote, setting the table for an uncertain confirmation effort on the Senate floor. 
Republicans, all of whom voted against David Chipman in the 10-10 Judiciary Committee vote, have raised alarms about Chipman&#39;s alleged hostility toward guns – citing his past comments and his previous work with gun control groups like Giffords and Everytown. It&#39;s likely all 50 Republicans will vote against the nominee on the Senate floor. 
&#34;After meeting with Mr. Chipman, listening to Mainers, and reviewing his record, I have decided to vote against Mr. Chipman’s nomination to serve as the ATF Director,&#34; Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in a statement earlier this week. &#34;In recent years, Mr. Chipman has been an outspoken critic of the firearms industry and has made statements that demean law-abiding gun owners.&#34;
Collins is one of the most moderate Republican senators and has been willing to vote for the president&#39;s executive nominees for a number of other positions. She also called Chipman &#34;an unusually divisive pick.&#34; Other Republicans were not so measured in their criticism.

SUSAN COLLINS: BIDEN ATF NOMINEE CHIPMAN ‘UNUSUALLY DIVISIVE,’ WILL VOTE AGAINST CONFIRMATION
Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., Thursday accused Chipman of having an &#34;agenda… to take away Second Amendment rights from law-abiding citizens while violent criminals are loose on our streets.&#34;
Regarding a Reddit post in which Chipman apparently advocated for the arrest of people who try to buy guns but fail background checks as a way to prevent future crime, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said Thursday that Chipman has a &#34;lack of respect for the most fundamental notions of due process.&#34; 
&#34;We don&#39;t arrest people before they commit crimes. That&#39;s the sort of thing that&#39;s reserved for bad post-apocalyptic dystopian novels and movies,&#34; Lee said. 
Most Democrats, meanwhile, say they respect Chipman&#39;s previous service as a street agent with the ATF and say he will help reduce crime at a time when shootings are up in many places around the United States. 
&#34;He&#39;s the leader that ATF needs,&#34; Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said. &#34;Mr. Chipman&#39;s support for the enforcement of common-sense gun restrictions, his dedication to ensuring that the ATF fulfills its mission of protecting our country, make him the candidate we need in this role at this time… He&#39;s a former ATF agent, he knows what it&#39;s like on the streets.&#34;

Most Democrats are expected to back the Biden&#39;s nominee, as they have for nearly all of his other picks, including the controversial new director of the Office of Personnel Management, Kiran Ahuja, who was confirmed 51-50 just this week with Vice President Harris breaking a tie. 
But at least one prominent moderate – Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. — has not taken a public stance on the Chipman nomination. He said that he is &#34;undecided&#34; on Chipman, according to 
Politico
. 
If Manchin eventually opposes Chipman, he will be the second Biden nominee to fall victim to the red-state Democratic senator after he opposed Biden Office of Management and Budget nominee Neera Tanden earlier this year over her caustic tweets about other senators.

A new 
head-scratching photo
 of 
President Biden
 and first lady Jill Biden posing with former President 
Jimmy Carter
 and former first lady Rosalynn Carter has social media abuzz over the camera angle where the Bidens look like giants towering over the former first couple. 
The Carter Center released the photo of the Bidens visiting the Carters last week at their home in 
Georgia
, where the two couples posed maskless and all smiles. 
JOE BIDEN GETS INTO &#39;TROUBLE,&#39; SPENDS 30 SECONDS LOOKING FOR HIS MASK
&#34;We’re pleased to share this wonderful photo from the 
@POTUS
 and 
@FLOTUS
 visit to see the Carters in Plains, Ga.!&#34; the Carter Center tweeted late Monday night. &#34;Thank you President and Mrs. Biden!&#34;
The photo drew plenty of eyebrows online as a kneeling Joe Biden appears to dwarf Rosalynn Carter, 93. Meanwhile, Jill Biden is holding the hand of a seated Jimmy Carter, 96, but also looks much bigger than the former president who once stood 5-feet-10-inches tall. 
BIDEN HECKLED IN GEORGIA OVER PRIVATE DETENTION CENTERS
&#34;What is going on here? Is it a bad Photoshop job? Are Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter just very small people living in a human dollhouse? Is Biden larger than we thought?&#34;

&#34;In which we learn that Joe and Jill Biden could both play center in the NBA,&#34; conservative commenter 
Ben Shapiro
 wrote. 
Other users compared Biden to holding a ventriloquist doll. 
The whole picture setup, from the artwork to the sizing, seemed to baffle social media. The post from the Carter Center had thousands of comments and retweets by midday Tuesday.

The Bidens traveled to Georgia on April 29 to mark the president&#39;s 100th day in office. The Bidens stopped by the Carters&#39; home to say hello since the former president could not attend the inauguration on Jan. 20. The couples visited for less than an hour before the Bidens departed for a car rally.

&#39;Ingraham Angle&#39; host slams White House chief medical adviser for dispensing COVID guidance &#39;not driven by science&#39;
Florida&#39;s experience of the 
coronavirus
 pandemic has confirmed &#34;the lockdown approach is a failed approach,&#34; Republican Gov. 
Ron DeSantis
 told &#34;
The Ingraham Angle
&#34; Thursday.
&#34;Not only has it been absolutely destructive to those societies [that implemented it],&#34; DeSantis told host Laura Ingraham, &#34;the COVID results per capita have been worse in places like New York and New Jersey and Pennsylvania.&#34;
The governor recently met with 
authors of the Great Barrington Declaration
, a small consortium of epidemiologists who prescribed a &#34;
focused protection
&#34; strategy to combat the virus, which often contradicted the edicts of Democratic governors and some federal health authorities.
&#34;These are some of the top experts in the world [that have] been able to validate that Florida&#39;s approach was the proper approach,&#34; the governor explained. 
DESANTIS CONDEMNS CRITICAL RACE THEORY, SAYS IT WON&#39;T BE TAUGHT IN FLORIDA CLASSROOMS
DeSantis added that his administration has overseen the vaccination of 70% of the state&#39;s senior citizen population, far more than many other states per capita.
&#34;In Florida, we followed a strategy of focused protection on elderly and vulnerable people, having the economy open, having schools open,&#34; DeSantis said. &#34;The result is our unemployment is significantly less than the national average. Our COVID mortality per capita is less than the national average.&#34;
In that regard, Ingraham noted that even DeSantis&#39; local critics have been complementary of his handling of the outbreak.
In a recent interview, Miami Mayor Francis X. Suarez criticized Tallahassee for barring local authorities from enforcing mask mandates  with fines and other punishments.
However, Suarez added, &#34;I have to commend [DeSantis] because he did take some decisions that were courageous, and the fact of the matter is the economy is relatively open and booming.&#34;

DeSantis responded by saying that he does believe local governments should have control over some aspects of health policy, but he believes such directives should be &#34;advisory&#34; in nature.
Miami-Dade County, Broward County, Palm Beach County, as well as Monroe County all have local mask mandates.

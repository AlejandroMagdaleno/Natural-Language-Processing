Secretary of State 
Antony Blinken
 was slammed by Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., for electing to testify virtually, rather than in person, in front of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the Biden administration’s botched withdrawal from 
Afghanistan
.
Perry blasted Blinken for not being at the hearing Monday over the troop withdrawal that saw 13 American service members die in a suicide bombing in Kabul.
Blinken revealed that he was seated in the annals of the State Department, blocks away from the first of two back-to-back Capitol Hill hearings to which he was summoned. Blinken testified roughly three miles away from where the hearing took place.

&#34;Mr. Blinken, assuming it isn’t classified, can you tell us where you are today?&#34; Perry asked.
&#34;Yes, I&#39;m at the State Department,&#34; Blinken replied.
&#34;Oh, couldn&#39;t be bothered to come down here and see Congress?&#34; Perry quipped back. &#34;Alright, that&#39;s great.&#34;
Blinken replied that his &#34;understanding&#34; was that the House of Representatives was &#34;not in session&#34; before being interrupted by the Pennsylvania congressman.

&#34;I’m right here, Mr. Secretary, so is the chairman and ranking member,&#34; Perry responded over Blinken. &#34;We’re here!&#34;
After Perry’s time to question Blinken ran out, House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., said the hearing was a &#34;hybrid hearing&#34; and that while some attendees elected to be at the hearing, others, such as Blinken, chose to &#34;be other places.&#34;

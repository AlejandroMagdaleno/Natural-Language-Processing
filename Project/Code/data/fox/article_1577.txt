Judicial Crisis Network President Carrie Severino and Pastor Robert Jeffress discuss upcoming case on &#39;Fox News @ Night&#39;
A former aide to failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called for packing the 
Supreme Court
 and said 
President Biden’s
 commission to explore that possibility is &#34;doomed from the start.&#34;
Biden’s Supreme Court commission, which has its first meeting Wednesday, will eventually produce a report on possible changes to the court, including expanding the number of seats. 
But Brian Fallon, the executive director of 
liberal dark money group
 Demand Justice, says he isn&#39;t holding his breath about what the commission will say. 
LIBERALS RAMP UP CALLS FOR SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BREYER TO RETIRE
&#34;It&#39;s not even on my calendar, because I don&#39;t care,&#34; Fallon, a former Clinton aide, told 
Politico
 on Monday.
Fallon, who also served in the Obama administration as a spokesman at the Department of Justice, added that there wasn’t a thing the commission would do that was &#34;going to impress&#34; him and added that he believes the &#34;whole thing is doomed from the start.&#34;
&#34;We oughta have a Black woman on the damn court to hear a case like this,&#34; Fallon also said, in reference to the Mississippi abortion case taken up by the Supreme Court on Monday.
BIDEN&#39;S SUPREME COURT COMMISSION TO MEET WITH KEY ABORTION CASE LOOMING
Demand Justice
 is a liberal advocacy group that is pushing to add four new justices to the Supreme Court, claiming on their website the court &#34;has been hijacked&#34; and that the justices appointed under former President Trump have &#34;fought to restrict women’s access to reproductive health services and deny equal treatment to LGBTQ Americans.&#34;
Fallon and fellow critics have blasted Biden’s court-packing commission for including members opposed to expanding the Supreme Court and producing a report rather than recommendations on whether to pack the court.

Biden’s commission is set to meet on Wednesday after the Supreme Court took up the major abortion case on Monday. The commission’s report will be due by mid-November, likely when the case is heard.
The case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization, concerns a Mississippi law that bans abortion procedures after 15 weeks. Lower courts blocked the law but Mississippi, like other right-leaning states in recent years, appealed the rulings to the Supreme Court in hopes that the new 6-3 Republican-appointed majority might expand the scope of allowable state regulations or bans on abortion.

WSJ Editorial page deputy editor Dan Henninger tells &#39;The Story&#39; his prediction of how Biden will respond: &#39;Ideally, we would hear some admission of error.&#39;
American military forces are &#34;conceding&#34; as evacuation efforts continue in 
Afghanistan
, a former special forces flight surgeon told Fox News on Thursday.
Lt. Col. Omar Hamada, M.D., warned Fox News on Thursday that the Taliban would &#34;own the entire country by Sunday.&#34;
&#34;It&#39;s pretty devastating,&#34; Hamada told Fox News regarding the ongoing events in Afghanistan. &#34;All American forces are currently being moved out and Kabul airport is being evacuated as we speak. We&#39;re conceding.&#34;
Hamada, an active emergency medical doctor, also said he believes the U.S. will be completely evacuated out of Afghanistan prior to the Aug. 31 deadline.
&#34;The Taliban will own the entire country by Sunday,&#34; Hamada predicted. &#34;We are probably going to be out of there before the deadline of the 31st and in doing so, we will be leaving many Americans and allies in country.&#34;

Fox News also asked Hamada about a 
report
 circulating that claims officials in 
President Biden
&#39;s administration had provided particular names of Americans in Afghanistan to the Taliban, asking the Taliban to allow them access to the airport.
&#34;What logical government gives their enemy a list of people who are loyal to them?&#34; Hamada asked rhetorically. &#34;I mean, it&#39;s a target list. It&#39;s not in any way I think gonna be used to evacuate Americans. … That&#39;s treachery and treasonous.&#34;
Hamada also slammed the decision to abandon American military vehicles and equipment behind as the evacuation continues.
According to Hamada, &#34;leaving hundreds of vehicles with top-secret, classified technology, including encryption technology&#34; for others to investigate after the fact is &#34;foolish and just as treasonous and treacherous.&#34;
&#34;Who does that?&#34; Hamada said regarding the left-behind &#34;small arms and equipment.&#34;
Hamada also took aim at Biden specifically, saying his &#34;taking orders from the Taliban and complying with them&#34; is &#34;alienating our friends and emboldening every enemy the US has ever had.&#34;

&#34;Congress sits by and does practically nothing except argue over a $3.5 trillion infrastructure bill of which probably 10 percent or less is going to infrastructure and the rest of it to special interests,&#34; Hamada told Fox News. &#34;I just don&#39;t understand what&#39;s happening to our country, not just the presidency and not just this administration, but Congress as well.&#34;
&#34;Legislators are sitting by, empowering and enabling it,&#34; he added.

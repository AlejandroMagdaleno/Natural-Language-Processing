The House GOP Israel Caucus co-chairman reacts to Ilhan Omar’s latest backtrack from comments made criticizing Israel and Jews
The office of &#34;
Squad
&#34; member Rep. 
Ilhan Omar
, D-Minn., accused the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) of placing the congresswoman’s &#34;life at risk&#34; with their latest ad campaign.
Omar spokesperson Jeremy Slevin posted the accusation Wednesday on Twitter, claiming the pro-Israel political committee&#39;s attack ads against Omar were endangering her. 
&#34;The language AIPAC uses in paid ads to smear and vilify [Omar] is virtually identical to the language used in death threats she gets,&#34; Slevin claimed on Twitter.
ILHAN OMAR SAYS AMERICA, LIKE HAMAS AND THE TALIBAN, HAS COMMITTED ‘UNTHINKABLE ATROCITIES’
&#34;Make no mistake: AIPAC is putting Rep. Omar&#39;s life at risk with repeated Islamophobic attack ads,&#34; he continued.
Slevin posted a screenshot of an AIPAC ad referencing Omar&#39;s infamous June comments where she compared 
Israel
 and America to terrorist groups Hamas and the Taliban as well as a screenshot of a different tweet by Omar about a death threat she received.
&#34;We have seen unthinkable atrocities committed by the U.S., Hamas, Israel, Afghanistan, and the Taliban,&#34; Omar wrote in June. &#34;I asked [Secretary of State Antony Blinken] where people are supposed to go for justice.&#34;

The 
Minnesota
 Democrat eventually 
walked back
 her comments, following outrage from both sides of the aisle, but then later said she 
didn&#39;t regret
 making the comparison. 
An AIPAC spokesperson told Fox News in an email statement that the ad puts a spotlight on her statements comparing America and Israel to terrorist organizations.
&#34;The ad concerning Representative Omar is completely fair and accurate,&#34; the spokesperson said. &#34;It is not a personal attack and highlights her outrageous statement putting the United States and Israel on the same level as the Taliban and Hamas.&#34;

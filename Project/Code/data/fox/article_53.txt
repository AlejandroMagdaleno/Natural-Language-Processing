Liberal media slams botched Kabul drone strike
New York Times Magazine reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones, who authored the 
1619 Project
, has been named to 
TIME
&#39;s list of the &#34;100 most influential people&#34; in 2021.
According to TIME&#39;s announcement regarding Hannah-Jones&#39; selection, American film director Barry Jenkins said &#34;Hannah-Jones is larger than life,&#34; referring to The 1619 Project as &#34;Nikole’s greatest work.&#34;
The New York Times&#39; 1619 Project is a long-form collaboration that seeks to &#34;reframe the country&#39;s history&#34; by bringing slavery and racism to the forefront of the national narrative. It was led by Hannah-Jones, who won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary last year for the project.

&#34;This may be the sum effect of Nikole’s greatest work—The 1619 Project, an analysis of the legacy of slavery in the U.S.—but it is certainly not the sum of her,&#34; Jenkins stated in his writing on Hannah-Jones for TIME. &#34;The journalist from Waterloo, Iowa, contains multitudes. She is the most emphatic laugh, the consummate ally, the staunchest critic.&#34;
Jenkins went on to claim that the &#34;light Nikole wields is titanic, a blinding beam that illuminates and scorches.&#34;
&#34;In her light, the wounds of America’s original and subsequent sins are laid bare,&#34; Jenkins added. &#34;With her light, the serrated flesh of this country’s past is both subject and predicate, a light wielded to both identify wounds and cauterize flesh.&#34;
Hannah-Jones has received immense criticism over her work, specifically the 1619 Project, which critics claim is historically inaccurate in some ways. Five academic historians even signed a 
letter
 claiming the 1619 Project got several elements of history wrong, including a claim that the Revolutionary War was fought to preserve slavery.

&#34;We write as historians to express our strong reservations about important aspects of The 1619 Project,&#34; the historians wrote in the letter, published in a December 2019 issue of The New York Times Magazine. &#34;The project is intended to offer a new version of American history in which slavery and white supremacy become the dominant organizing themes.&#34;
While applauding &#34;efforts to address the enduring centrality of slavery and racism to our history,&#34; the historians stated they were &#34;dismayed at some of the factual errors in the project and the closed process behind it.&#34;
Earlier this year, Hannah-Jones 
claimed
 that opposition to the 1619 Project is not about the &#34;accurate rendering of history.&#34;

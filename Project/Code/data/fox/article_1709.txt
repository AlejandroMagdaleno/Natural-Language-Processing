After 
President Biden
 said Monday he is praying the jury comes to the &#34;right verdict&#34; in the Derek Chauvin trial, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden doesn’t see that as &#34;weighing in.&#34; Political and legal experts think otherwise. 
&#34;I don&#39;t think he would see it as weighing in on the verdict,&#34; Psaki said. 
On Monday, the president said: &#34;I’m praying the verdict is the right verdict. Which is – I think it’s overwhelming in my view.&#34;
Some were shocked to hear a sitting president weigh in before a verdict is announced.
&#34;This is a remarkable statement from a sitting president on a criminal trial currently underway,&#34; CNN anchor Jim Sciutto wrote on Twitter. 
&#34;I&#39;m saying this as someone who thinks Chauvin should be convicted for manslaughter &amp; 3rd degree murder: this is highly irresponsible of Biden to say,&#34; wrote Washington Examiner commentary writer Tiana Lowe. &#34;Elected officials should not be weighing into an ongoing trial, especially one where the &#34;wrong&#34; verdict will result in mass chaos.&#34;
PRESIDENT OFFERED SUPPORT IN MONDAY CALL WITH GEORGE FLOYD&#39;S FAMILY
Psaki reiterated that Biden chose to spoke out after the jury had been sequestered, and is currently deliberating a verdict. Biden too had said that he wouldn’t make the remarks if the jury wasn’t sequestered. 
Speaking with reporters at 
the White House
, the president discussed his call on Monday with the family of 
George Floyd
, the Black man in Minnesota who died after he was seen on video – handcuffed – saying &#34;I can&#39;t breathe&#34; as Chauvin kneeled on Floyd&#39;s neck. His death sparked nationwide protests last spring and summer over police brutality against minorities and systemic racism.
BIDEN &#39;PRAYING&#39; CHAUVIN JURY REACHES &#39;RIGHT VERDICT 
Chauvin was charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd&#39;s death. He pleaded not guilty to all three charges.
Psaki said the president &#34;certainly is not looking to influence, but he has been touched by the impact on the family. Hence, he called the family yesterday and had that discussion. I expect he will weigh in further once there is a verdict.&#34;
On Monday, 
the judge in the Chauvin trial
 said that he wished elected officials would stop referencing the case &#34;especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law&#34; so as to let the judicial process play out as intended.
Judge Peter Cahill was referring to controversial comments over the weekend by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, who 
urged protesters
 in Minnesota to &#34;stay in the street&#34; and &#34;get more confrontational&#34; if Chauvin is not found guilty.

Psaki declined to weigh in on Waters’ comments, adding that the California Democrat had &#34;provided further clarification of her own remarks.&#34; Waters, in comments to 
The Grio
, said she is a &#34;non-violent person&#34; and she&#39;s not worried about Republicans trying to &#34;distort&#34; her words.

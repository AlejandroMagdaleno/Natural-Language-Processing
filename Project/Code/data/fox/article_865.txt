Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., slams Biden’s immigration policy amid migrant surge.
On Tuesday, Rep. 
Andy Biggs
 R-Ariz., claimed that the 
Biden
 administration is &#34;basically letting everybody in&#34; at the 
border
 and said that they are &#34;encouraging&#34; more people to come as 
immigration
 continues to surge in the United States.
On 
&#34;The Faulkner Focus,&#34;
 Biggs said that immigration numbers are already nearly at the same level of the 2019 surge under President Trump, the highest level of apprehension that ever took place, and claimed that the Biden administration anticipated the influx of immigrants and opened up the border and migrant

Despite turning away some immigrants at the border under Title 42, Biggs said that the federal government is not doing anything to slow down or deport illegal immigrants under their updated catch-and-release policies.

That’s why they opened up additional facilities. I’ve seen some of those facilities when there was nobody in them, those are now full and they’re going to keep getting more and more full. Just think about this, we’re already almost at the same level, the highest level of apprehension we ever did when the 2019 surge took place. That’s where we are now and we’re not doing anything to slow it down. In fact, they actually are continuing to encourage people to come across.&#34;

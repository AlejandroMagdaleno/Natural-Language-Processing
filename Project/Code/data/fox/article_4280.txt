Fox News correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest from Washington on &#39;America Reports&#39;
Two Republican senators turned racism charges against the filibuster by Democrats against them, asking why Senate Democrats previously used the measure to block Sen. Tim Scott&#39;s, R-S.C., police reform bill.
Democrat calls to end the use of the filibuster have 
grown 
since they have taken control of the majority in Congress, with the aim of pushing through a liberal legislative agenda.
Some progressives have attempted to label the procedural measure as 
racist
, but are finding opposition both in the Republican Party and from some 
Democrats
.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., responded to the racism charges in floor speeches on Tuesday, pointing out that the Democrats had used the filibuster to 
kill 
Scott’s police reform bill, the 
Justice Act
.
TIM SCOTT ON SENATE DEMS BLOCKING POLICE REFORM BILL: ‘PURE RACE POLITICS AT ITS WORST’
McConnell slammed the Democrats for the &#34;fake history&#34; they have been pushing in regards to the filibuster, and slammed the party for using &#34;the filibuster to kill Sen. Tim Scott’s police reform and anti-lynching bill.&#34;
&#34;If our Democratic colleagues really believe what they’re saying, did they themselves use a racist tool against Sen. Scott’s police reform bill last year?&#34; said McConnell. &#34;Did they use a racist relic when they delayed the CARES Act or blocked legislation to protect unborn babies who can feel pain?&#34;
&#34;Or is our colleagues’ story that the filibuster was not an offensive relic as recently as last summer, but magically became an offensive relic the instant Democrats came to have a majority?&#34; added the Republican Leader.
Sasse also took a dig at the Democrats for their racism charges against the filibuster during his speech on the Senate floor, pointing out they called the filibuster &#34;an essential American institution that forced compromise.&#34;
DEMOCRATS HATE FILIBUSTER NOW BUT USED IT TO BLOCK GOP LEGISLATION UNDER TRUMP
&#34;But now that it can be occasionally used to resist a 51-50, strict majoritarian exercise in power, it’s supposedly exclusively a relic of slavery and a tool of Jim Crow,&#34; Sasse said. &#34;It’s nonsense, and the people saying it know that it’s nonsense.&#34;
Sasse pointed out that the Democrats had used the filibuster last year and &#34;weren’t racist&#34; when they used it. He then called the racism charges used in calls to end the filibuster &#34;BS that’s been focus-grouped.&#34;
The Nebraska senator also gave a grave warning that ending the filibuster would &#34;be the end of the Senate.&#34;
&#34;They used the same rule last year, and you weren’t racist when you used the rule last year,&#34; said Sasse. &#34;This is BS that’s been focus-grouped and particular bills are being used as an excuse to grab power that won’t just be for this bill – it’ll be forever.&#34;
SEN. DURBIN ADDRESSES CONFLICTING REMARKS REGARDING THE FILIBUSTER
&#34;It’ll be the end of the Senate,&#34; warned Sasse.
Sasse then ripped the Democrats for the racism charge against the filibuster, asking them if the filibuster was &#34;really a tool of Jim Crow when it was used against Tim Scott last year?&#34;
&#34;I don’t think so, and I don’t think any of you think so,&#34; Sasse blasted Senate Democrats. &#34;If somebody wants to come to the floor and repent of their racism for having used the filibuster last year, please do.&#34;
&#34;But it isn’t what was happening, so stop with the nonsense rhetoric that’s just for an MSNBC soundbite tonight,&#34; added Sasse.
MANCHIN: ‘I’M SUPPORTING THE FILIBUSTER’ BUT ‘IT SHOULD BE PAINFUL’ TO USE
Scott, who is Black, 
described 
the blocking of the Justice Act last year as &#34;race politics at its worst.&#34;
The South Carolina senator said last year that the Democrats didn’t believe that the GOP &#34;would produce a quality product.&#34;
&#34;What actually happened was that the Democrats did not believe that we would produce a quality product. Once we produced it and then president put icing on the cake [and] came up with executive order that even the liberal commentators said this was a real, meaningful executive order, I think they took a leap back because they don&#39;t want [former President Donald Trump] to have a victory on another serious issue confronting the minority communities,&#34; Scott commented.
&#34;This is pure, pure race politics at its worst,&#34; he added.

Last week, progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., claimed the filibuster was 
racist 
in an interview with Axios.
&#34;The filibuster has deep roots in racism, and it should not be permitted to serve that function, or to create a veto for the minority,&#34; Warren said. &#34;In a democracy, it&#39;s majority rules.&#34;
Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., 
attacked 
the filibuster last week, flipping on his previous position, and 
said 
on Monday that he was posing &#34;a challenge to senators in both political parties&#34; to prove that &#34;under the current rules, with the filibuster requiring 60 votes, that we can actually produce something.&#34;

Ben Domenech discusses COVID mandates and government control on &#39;Fox News Primetime.&#39;
A majority of Americans oppose requiring proof of vaccination to enable people to dine at restaurants.
Asked in what situations proof of 
vaccination
 should be required, 59% of those polled said that restaurants should not require proof of vaccinations status, compared to 37% who support the idea, according to the results of a 
Quinnipiac University poll
 released Thursday.
But Americans were more split on whether proof of vaccination should be required in other places. Asked if travelers should be required to show proof of vaccination on airlines, 52% supported that mandate compared to 45% who opposed it. More respondents also felt that attendees of large sporting or entertaining events should show proof of vaccination, with 49% supporting the idea compared to 47% who opposed it.
&#34;There are varying opinions on who should be required to prove they have had the vaccine. Yes on proof of vaccination for those who fly, a toss-up for people attending large events, and a no for people going to restaurants,&#34; Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said of the results.

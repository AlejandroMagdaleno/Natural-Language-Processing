Rep. Lee. Zeldin, R-N.Y., announced Saturday he is in &#34;complete remission&#34; after receiving treatment from being diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) last November.
&#34;Through early detection, last November, I was diagnosed with early stage chronic myeloid leukemia. I then began treatment with an immediately positive response and no side effects,&#34; Zeldin said in a statement. &#34;Over the last 9 months, I have achieved complete remission, am expected to live a normal life, and my doctor says I currently have no evidence of this disease in my system. My health is phenomenal and I continue to operate at 110%.&#34;

I have also not missed any Army Reserve Duty as a result of this diagnosis.&#34;

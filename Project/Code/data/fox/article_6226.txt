Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, weighs in on President Trump&#39;s upcoming impeachment trial.
Sen. 
Mike Lee
, R-Utah, speculated that while former President 
Donald Trump
 will undergo a &#34;lengthy&#34; impeachment trial in the 
Senate,
 he will ultimately be acquitted of inciting an insurrection against the government.
During an appearance on 
&#34;America&#39;s Newsroom&#34;,
 Lee indicated the text surrounding whether a former president can be impeached isn&#39;t clear and that U.S. senators should operate under an &#34;abundance of caution&#34; in order to avoid future abuse of constitutional law for partisan purposes. 
Trump&#39;s lawyers are expected to argue that point, while House impeachment managers are prepped to refute it, in an effort that critics argue is intended to prevent a rumored 2024 Trump campaign.
TRUMP&#39;S IMPEACHMENT TRIAL: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
MIKE LEE: &#34;It begins with a lengthy diatribe against the former president and I think it ends in his acquittal. Look, one of the things that we&#39;ll be beginning with today is talking about the fact that there is a constitutional jurisdictional question in front of us. The constitutional text itself is ambiguous. It could be read one way or the other. I think it should be read in an abundance of caution to make sure that it’s not abused for partisan political purposes in future congresses with future presidents and future ex-officials ...
If we start saying right now that there is no time limit on the appropriate time frame for impeaching a president, you can impeach a former president. I think it will take us to a place that&#39;s not good for the country. What we need right now is unity and this doesn&#39;t help.

The fact that he was still president while he was impeached ignores a couple of facts. First of all, they didn&#39;t actually send the articles of impeachment over to the Senate, thus the trial couldn&#39;t even begin until after he had left office. If they had really wanted to make sure this continued they should have sent them over immediately. They didn&#39;t do that. Moreover, the interpretation that they&#39;re using, one that says it doesn&#39;t matter when we try the president ... the Constitution doesn&#39;t make any meaningful distinction between someone who has just left office and someone out who has been out of office for a year or two years or much longer.&#34;

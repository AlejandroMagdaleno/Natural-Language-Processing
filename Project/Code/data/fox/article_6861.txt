Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blasts critical race theory opponents as uninterested in combating racism during a CNN interview.
Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
, D-N.Y., said she wants to &#34;abolish&#34; the U.S. carceral system during a campaign event for Ohio congressional candidate 
Nina Turner
 on Saturday.
&#34;I want to abolish our carceral system that&#39;s designed to trap Black and Brown men,&#34; the democratic socialist told a rally of Turner supporters in Cleveland. &#34;I want justice. I want peace, and I want prosperity. That’s what I want.&#34;
OCASIO-CORTEZ DEFENDS TWEET PROMOTING IDEA OF ‘PRISON ABOLITION,&#39; PUSHES ‘JUST ALTERNATIVES’ TO INCARCERATION
Ocasio-Cortez 
was in Cleveland
 for a canvassing event supporting Turner, a progressive former state senator and co-chair of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign. 
Turner is looking to represent Ohio’s 11th Congressional District – a seat vacated by former U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge when she became secretary of Housing and Urban Development in March.
Ocasio-Cortez on Saturday characterized Turner&#39;s fight as one between grassroots and corporate politics.
 &#34;This isn&#39;t about Nina versus any opponent; this is about the people versus big money,&#34; the congresswoman said, WJW reported.
&#34;This is a deep blue seat. It&#39;s a deep blue seat,&#34; she reportedly said. &#34;Districts like Ohio’s 11th should be leading the country on issues. They are opportunities, they are very rare opportunities, very rare districts like this one that can take and be visionary.&#34;

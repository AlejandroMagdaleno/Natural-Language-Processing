Indiana Republican joins &#39;Your World&#39; with reflections on life of Limbaugh, who died Wednesday at age 70
The death of conservative 
radio talk show
 host Rush Limbaugh leaves &#34;a big void,&#34; former Vice President Dan Quayle told &#34;
Your World
&#34; Wednesday. 
&#34;I knew that Rush was ill. I knew it was terminal. But the day is here,&#34; said Quayle, who who served as President George H.W. Bush&#39;s vice president from 1989 to 1993.
The former Republican senator from 
Indiana
 remembered Limbaugh, who died earlier in the day at age 70 after a battle with lung cancer, as more than a guy who sat behind a golden microphone for three hours and discussed politics.
Quayle recalled that the longtime host spent countless hours outside his Palm Beach, Fla. studios studying news and &#34;getting the fact straight&#34; before coming on the air.
&#34;He was an unbelievable communicator,&#34; Quayle told host Neil Cavuto. &#34;Beyond that, Neil, he was a very smart philosophical person. We see him and hear him in his studio. But he did a lot of work outside that studio. He worked late at night. He was tireless ... He would communicate with the men and women on the street.&#34;
Host Neil Cavuto recalled how Limbaugh had defended Quayle when Bush selected him as his running mate in 1988: &#34;He welcomed your youth and what you could bring to the ticket.&#34;
&#34;I think that&#39;s one of the reasons that George Bush selected, me among others is that I was the first of my generation to be on the national ticket, the first of my generation to be elected president or vice president,&#34; Quayle agreed.

&#34;He would communicate with presidents, vice presidents, Speakers of the House, all sorts of folks. He was just a tremendous person [who] loved people, loved life,&#34; he said.
&#34;We know him as an entertainer and a commentator. But he loved life. It was a real joy to know him. It&#39;s with [a] heavy heart that Marilyn and I express our best wishes and condolences to his family.&#34;

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott rips the progressive backlash against the Georgia election reform bill.

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT DECLINES TO THROW FIRST PITCH OVER MLB STANCE ON GEORGIA VOTING LAW
GREG ABBOTT: I could not associate myself with Major League Baseball, that had gone out and done something that was absolutely ridiculous. It was taking positions with regard to these voter and election laws in the state of Georgia, where clearly Major League Baseball had not read or not studied it and did not know what those laws provided.

And I refuse to associate with an organization that is taking political positions when they need to be focusing on baseball and on opening day for the Texas Rangers.

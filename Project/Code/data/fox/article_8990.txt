Tim Scott tells &#39;Fox News Primetime&#39; Democrats &#39;on prowl&#39; for liberal takeover and want to stoke &#39;fear&#39;. 
Sen. 
Tim Scott
, R-S.C., ripped 
President Biden
 and congressional Democrats Friday for changing their view of the Senate filibuster rule, telling 
&#34;Fox News Primetime&#34;
 that they are invoking racism in order to scare Republicans.
Scott told host Brian Kilmeade it was both &#34;frustrating and irritating&#34; to see Democrats use the filibuster last year to block a police reform bill he proposed and claimed would have disproportionately helped the Black community.
&#34;Here&#39;s what we know about the Democrats,&#34; Scott said. &#34;They were for the filibuster before they were against the filibuster. I keep asking myself, &#39;Will the real Chuck Schumer please stand up?&#39; Is it the one who was for the filibuster or is it the new one who is now against filibuster?&#34;
Scott added that Democrats &#34;use the word &#39;racist&#39; whenever they are trying to scare people into their corner. It has nothing to do with race. But they don&#39;t care. Winning at all costs means losing at some point.&#34;
KEMP INSISTS CONTROVERSIAL GEORGIA ELECTION REFORM BILL &#39;EXPANDING THE RIGHT TO VOTE&#39;
Turning to House Democrats&#39; massive election reform bill, the For The People Act, Scott said &#34;every single part&#34; of the measure &#34;is designed to maintain power at all costs ... even if they have to do things that are unethical.&#34;
&#34;[H.R. 1] eliminates all voter ID laws. They are going to allow for ballot harvesting to become the law of the land,&#34; he said. &#34;Legalized ballot harvesting, taxpayer-funded campaigns and prohibition of state voter ID laws should be a big, loud &#39;fraud alert.&#39;&#34;
If the legislative filibuster is nixed, Democrats can pass H.R. 1 as long as they have no defections. 
Vice President Kamala Harris
 could break a 50-50 tie in Democrats&#39; favor; assuming no Republican sides with the majority.

Scott also argued that Biden was wrong to call the new 
Georgia election law
 racist, remarking that in North Carolina, a voter ID law actually increased Black participation in recent elections.
&#34;So if you want to look at whether or not things have an impact, let&#39;s study the numbers. They are not studying the numbers,&#34; he said. &#34;They are literally on the prowl for a liberal takeover of everything and then codifying it permanently by bringing in new states that have the overwhelming Democrat approach to governing.&#34;

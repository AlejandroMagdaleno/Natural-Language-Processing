President Trump
 left a note for 
incoming President Joe Biden
 before departing 
the White House
, Trump spokesperson Judd Deere confirmed.
Deere said the contents of the note are just between Trump and Biden, and that it was left for Biden in the Resolute desk in the Oval Office. It&#39;s traditional for outgoing presidents to leave a note for their successor.
LIVE UPDATES FROM FOX NEWS OF THE BIDEN INAUGURATION
While Trump is breaking a century and a half tradition of every outgoing president attending the 
inauguration
 of their successor, he is keeping with the now 32-year tradition of the departing commander in chief writing a note to the incoming president.
As he left the White House in January 1989 after two terms in office, President Ronald Reagan started the tradition -- leaving a note for his successor, George H.W. Bush, who also happened to be his vice president.
Four years later, despite losing to then-Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas in a bitterly contested election, outgoing President Bush left Clinton a note in the Oval Office. The tradition has carried on to this day.

Outgoing Trump White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany also tweeted a picture of notes she left for Biden communications staffers.

Senate Judiciary Committee member advocates for voting transparency on &#39;Tucker Carlson Tonight.&#39;
The 
Nevada
 
state legislature is looking to permanently codify emergency 
voting
 
procedures implemented during the 
COVID-19
 pandemic, such as ballot harvesting, while also eyeing the addition of straight-ticket voting to state law.
On Wednesday, the Democrat-controlled Nevada General Assembly passed Assembly Bill 321, a measure that legally codifies ballot harvesting and expanded mail-in voting measures initially implemented as the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with the 2020 election cycle.
Additionally, the state Senate is considering Senate Bill 292, which would implement straight-ticket voting in the state. This means voters could check a single box at the top of the ticket to vote for all the candidates of a particular party.
Republicans say they are concerned that the two bills could undermine voters&#39; trust in elections.
CRUZ VOWS TO ‘LEAD THE FIGHT’ AGAINST DEMOCRATS’ ELECTION BILL, WHICH HE CALLS THE ‘CORRUPT POLITICIANS ACT’
Former Nevada Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison said in a statement on Thursday that the &#34;pandemic-inspired changes&#34; from 2020 have eroded &#34;the faith many Nevadans had in the electoral process.&#34;
&#34;Democrats and Gov. Sisolak promised mailing unsolicited ballots and allowing paid partisan staffers to go door-to-door collecting strangers&#39; ballots would only be for emergencies, and less than a year later they are going back on their word,&#34; Hutchison said.
&#34;But those dangerous reforms aren&#39;t enough for some Nevada Democrats. While red and blue states eliminate laws that allow for straight-ticket voting, our state is moving in the opposite direction and pushing to bring this failed practice here in the Silver State,&#34; the former lieutenant governor said.
&#34;This will increase extreme politics and partisan divide in Nevada and further erode the trust Nevadans have in their elections,&#34; he added.
NORTH LAS VEGAS MAYOR, A DEMOCRAT TURNED REPUBLICAN, LAUNCHES GUBERNATORIAL RUN IN NEVADA
Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman Ronna McDaniel spoke out against the legislation in a Twitter thread, saying the GOP in the state was &#34;fighting back.&#34;
&#34;Codifying these practices is a recipe for disaster,&#34; McDaniel wrote. &#34;It is reported that in 2020, 20% of mail ballots in Clark County were sent to outdated addresses, leading to hundreds of thousands of unclaimed live ballots statewide.&#34;
&#34;Both Democrat and Republican states have pushed to remove a box for straight party ticket voting,&#34; she continued. &#34;It reduces civic engagement, and when combined with partisan ballot harvesting, it will allow partisan activists to harvest straight-ticket ballots.&#34;
AB 321 passed the Nevada lower house on Wednesday and was sent to the state Senate on 
Thursday

Several states
 from across the political spectrum have moved recently to abolish straight-ticket voting from their states.

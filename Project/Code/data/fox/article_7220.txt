Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joins ‘Sunday Morning Futures’ to discuss the investigation into the origin of the coronavirus. 
Current evidence still suggests that the 
coronavirus
 originated from a lab in 
Wuhan, China
, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday, warning that the risk of bioweapons and bioterror arising from the region is &#34;very real.&#34;
Pompeo suggested to &#34;
Sunday Morning Futures
&#34; anchor Maria Bartiromo that the Chinese Communist Party &#34;covered up&#34; the origins of COVID-19 and that evidence continues to mount despite their efforts to deny access to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the doctors who worked there and original materials from the lab.

&#34;We worked to get every bit of evidence that we could, we tried to deliver this to the CDC, tried to work with the Chinese. They covered it up terribly,&#34; Pompeo said.
He said the combination of circumstantial evidence and China&#39;s intense effort to deny any information relating to the lab suggests to him that the virus originated in that lab.
&#34;I haven’t seen a shred of evidence to suggest anything to the contrary,&#34; Pompeo said.
The former secretary of state also warned that similar scenarios could happen in the future, pointing to the possibility of biological warfare.

&#34;The risk that something like this happens again from that laboratory or another Chinese laboratory is very real,&#34; Pompeo said. &#34;They [China] are operating and conducting activities that are inconsistent with their capacity to secure those facilities. And the risk of bioweapons and bioterror emanating from this region is very real.&#34; 
It remains unclear where the virus originated as Biden administration officials express concerns over Chinese interference in investigative efforts.

President Biden
 spoke with Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu
 on Wednesday, Netanyahu’s office confirmed to Fox News.
Netanyahu’s office characterized the call as &#34;warm and friendly&#34; and said that it lasted for roughly an hour.

Among the topics that were said to be discussed were promoting peace agreements, challenges in the region – including the Iranian threat – and the COVID-19 crisis.

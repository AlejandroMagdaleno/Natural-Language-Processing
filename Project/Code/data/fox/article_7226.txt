Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discusses President Biden&#39;s role in the unrest in the Middle East.
Former 
Secretary of State
 Mike Pompeo is planning a trip to 
Israel
 this week, a visit that could coincide with the Biden administration’s efforts to solidify a cease-fire agreement between the key US ally and Hamas militants.
Pompeo is slated to travel to Israel in a private capacity to celebrate the retirement of Yossi Cohen, the head of Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, a source close to the former secretary of state confirmed.

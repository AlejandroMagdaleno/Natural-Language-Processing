Democrat California Rep. Brad Sherman reacts to election results, says it&#39;s encouraging for Virginia&#39;s governors race in November
President Biden
 released a statement Wednesday lauding 
California
 Gov. 
Gavin Newsom
’s recall election victory, calling it a &#34;win&#34; for &#34;strong vaccine requirements.&#34;
&#34;Congratulations to Governor Gavin Newsom on defeating the recall vote,&#34; Biden’s statement said. &#34;This vote is a resounding win for the approach that he and I share to beating the pandemic: strong vaccine requirements, strong steps to reopen schools safely, and strong plans to distribute real medicines—not fake treatments—to help those who get sick.&#34;
DAVID MARCUS: NEWSOM WON THE CALIFORNIA RECALL BUT WE TAKE AWAY THESE VALUABLE LESSONS
Biden added, &#34;The fact that voters in both traditionally Democratic and traditionally Republican parts of the state rejected the recall shows that Americans are unifying behind taking these steps to get the pandemic behind us.&#34;
California residents voted Tuesday night to keep Gov. Newsom in office after a recall effort – largely influenced by the governor’s strict coronavirus restrictions – gathered over 1.5 million signatures and made it on the ballot.
In order to oust Newsom, more than 50% of voters needed to vote to remove him, at which point he would have been replaced by the challenger with the highest vote total. Less than 40% of voters voted to recall Newsom and almost 64% voted to keep him in power.

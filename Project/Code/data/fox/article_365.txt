The
 
New York
 Democrat also said that she was a &#34;Planned Parenthood&#34; baby, as her mother relied on prenatal services offered by Planned Parenthood before her birth. 
&#34;If we want to talk about Planned Parenthood let’s talk about how many lives Planned Parenthood has saved. And how many babies have been born because of the prenatal care provided by Planned Parenthood,&#34; Ocasio-Cortez said.

She spoke during a House committee hearing titled

&#34;If we’re concerned about life we don’t get to talk about anyone else … when we are upholding policies that kill people,&#34; she continued.

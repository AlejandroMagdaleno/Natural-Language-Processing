Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., examines the details of Biden&#39;s infrastructure spending and the border crisis
Sen. John Thune, R-
S.D.
, said that he is not &#34;afraid of a fight&#34; if former President 
Donald Trump
 campaigns against him in 2022 after being labeled a &#34;weak and inneffective RINO&#34; by him earlier in the year.
&#34;I&#39;ve been through wars in South Dakota, political wars, with my own party when I ran the first time, with the Democrats in a couple of hotly contested Senate races, so being afraid of a fight or somebody coming after me is not something that&#39;s going to influence that decision,&#34; Thune told &#34;Fox News Sunday.&#34;
TRUMP GOES AFTER MCCONNELL, FAUCI IN OFF-SCRIPT MAR-A-LAGO SPEECH
Thune has yet to officially announced that he&#39;s running for re-election, but said he will provide an update on this in due time.
&#34;I will announce something on my re-election plan, as I typically do, later in the year,&#34; he said on Sunday. &#34;I think these campaigns are way too long, cost way too much, and I think the American people -- I know people in South Dakota -- get weary of it, so I&#39;m going to focus on doing the job, which I think is the best way to run for re-election in any election cycle. Who gets in against me is not going to be a factor in that decision.&#34;

As Senate Minority Whip, Thune is Senate Minority Leader 
Mitch McConnell&#39;s
 second-in-command. Trump, who&#39;s been critical of Thune and other members of Republican leadership, 
blasted
 McConnell as a &#34;dumb son of a b----&#34; at a gathering of Republian donors at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night.
&#34;I think a lot of that rhetoric is, you know, it&#39;s part of the style and tone that comes with the former president, but I think he and Mitch McConnell have a common goal, and that is getting the majority back in 2022,&#34; Thune said. &#34;Hopefully that&#39;ll be the thing that unites us because if we want to defeat and succeed against the Democrats and get that majority back, that&#39;s the best way to do it.&#34;

Trump previously 
called for
 South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to challenge Thune in 2022, calling Thune a &#34;RINO,&#34; or &#34;Republican In Name Only.&#34; Thune drew Trump’s ire recently after he criticized Trump’s bid to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election.
Trump also referred to Thune as &#34;Mitch’s boy,&#34; in a reference to McConnell, and warned that Thune would be &#34;primaried in 2022, political career over.&#34;

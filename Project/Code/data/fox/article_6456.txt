The 
Libertarian
 Party of 
New Hampshire
 ignited a social media firestorm this week when it called for the legalization of child labor.
MASSIE: CDC&#39;S ENTIRE LEADERSHIP MUST BE FIRED OVER CORONAVIRUS &#39;LIES&#39;
&#34;Legalize child labor. Children will learn more on a job site than in public school,&#34; the New Hampshire Libertarian Party wrote on 
Twitter
 on Monday. &#34;At the very least, the minimum age to work is a states&#39; rights issue. Federal minimum work ages are unconstitutional.&#34;
&#34;Child labor laws don&#39;t prevent 4-year-olds from working in the coal mines, they prevent 14-year-olds from working in flower shops,&#34; the post 
continued
.
New Hampshire Libertarian Party chair Jilletta Jarvis told Fox News in a statement on Wednesday that many of the state&#39;s child labor provisions make no sense.
&#34;Our proposal is that the minimum age requirement be lowered to 16 without school superintendent approval, if a child is homeschooled, this option is difficult for them,&#34; Jarvis said. &#34;We also propose that if a minor has graduated high school or obtained a GED, they have already proven themselves and should not be required to obtain permission to be employed. The law in [New Hampshire] currently prohibits these individuals from seeking employment without a signed written document from a parent on file.&#34;
The New Hampshire Libertarian Party faced immediate backlash for Monday&#39;s message.

&#34;I&#39;m sorry, but no. This isn&#39;t what libertarianism means to millions of Americans - pushing a disturbing and out of touch stance on child labor is entirely detached from what people need in America today. This does not advance liberty, or help change people&#39;s opinions,&#34; former Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson 
responded
.
&#34;Gary Johnson has every right to voice his opinion on this issue and I, personally, am glad that he did so. Many times candidates that do not win disappear and Gary has not done this. He is an active member of the Libertarian Party and has held up his promises. I, personally, have a great deal of respect for him,&#34; Jarvis told Fox News. &#34;I know that there was an emotional reaction to his criticism and we are working internally on that issue.&#34;
Others responded to the call to legalize child labor with mockery.
&#34;C&#39;MON, WE ALREADY LET THEM BUILD THEIR OWN BEARS,&#34; writer Jill Twiss wrote on 
Twitter

&#34;I am once again calling for outlawing the Libertarian Party,&#34; Pedro Gonzalez of Chronicles Magazine wrote on 
Twitter
.
The New Hampshire Libertarian Party doubled down on its message.
&#34;It&#39;s obvious that socialists are triggered by the idea of children working because they know any thirteen year-old capable of holding a job is more reliable and capable than they are at 45,&#34; the group wrote on 
Twitter
 on Tuesday.
Every state has its own laws governing child labor, but the baseline federal laws are the Fair Labor Standards Act enacted in 1938. The laws &#34;were enacted to ensure that when young people work, the work is safe and does not jeopardize their health, well-being or educational opportunities,&#34; according to the 
Department of Labor

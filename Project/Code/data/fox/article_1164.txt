&#34;What [the U.S. is] doing right now is releasing every single one of them as fast as we possibly can into the interior United States,&#34; Morgan said. &#34;That’s the goal of this [Biden] administration: Not to protect our borders, not to enforce our laws, but absolutely to exploit them, abuse them and let people illegally in the United States … And then prevent ICE from lawfully apprehending them and deporting them.&#34;

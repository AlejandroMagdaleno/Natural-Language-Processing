The audio is of a July 2019 phone call between Giuliani, US diplomat Kurt Volker, and Andriy Yermak, a senior adviser to 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky
. The call was a precursor to 
Trump's infamous call 
with Zelensky, and both conversations later became a central part of Trump's first 
impeachment
.
During the roughly 40-minute call, Giuliani repeatedly told Yermak that Zelensky should publicly announce investigations into 
possible corruption by Biden 
in Ukraine, and into 
claims
 that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election to hurt Trump. These separate claims are both untrue.
Giuliani did not respond to CNN's requests to comment about the new audiotape. In the past, he has said he didn't do anything wrong in Ukraine and was merely pursuing his client's best interests. He was Trump's personal lawyer at the time.

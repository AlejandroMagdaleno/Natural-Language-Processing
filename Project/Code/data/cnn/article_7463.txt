"I wouldn't want to estimate or underestimate Donald Trump as an opponent if he chooses to run," Klain told Mike Allen in an interview on "Axios on HBO" slated to air Sunday, adding, "My experience, Mike, is that incumbent presidents are judged on their record."
"President Trump had a bad record in 2020. Joe Biden is hopefully assembling a powerful record to run on if he runs for reelection in 2024," Klain said.
Biden told reporters 
during a news conference
 in March that he was planning to run again in 2024.
"That's my expectation," he said, before adding, "I'm a great respecter of fate. I've never been able to plan four-and-a-half, three-and-a-half years ahead for certain."
Trump has yet to acknowledge the results of 
the 2020 election
 as legitimate, but told 
The Daily Wire
 last week that "people are going to be very, very happy when I make a certain announcement."

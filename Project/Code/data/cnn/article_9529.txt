The new figures are evidence of the 
nation's changing demographics
, showing how states in the South and West are growing in population size, while their Upper Midwest and Northeast counterparts shrink in size. 
The state population totals will be used in the redistricting process that comes every ten years, when some states gain new congressional seats while others lose some. This time around, Texas, Florida, Colorado, Montana and others will gain seats. California and 
New York are among those losing seats.

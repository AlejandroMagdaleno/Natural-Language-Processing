"After careful consideration, we decided to review this matter further," the Commerce Department's Office of Inspector General wrote in a Friday letter to Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono, who requested the investigation along with fellow Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, Elizabeth Warren, Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal.
The New York Times 
first reported 
the investigation.
The Washington Post 
reported
 earlier this month that the White House Office of Science and Technology had reassigned Trump appointees David Legates and Ryan Maue, both senior officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who had been with OSTP since November, after it was discovered they posted the controversial documents on nongovernment websites. 
The papers used the imprint of the Executive Office of the President and noted they were copyrighted by OSTP even though the OSTP director never approved, The Post reported. 
Legates, the main author on the series of papers, according to the Post, is a longtime climate change skeptic who 
was originally appointed
 by the Trump administration to help run NOAA and soon after became the head of the US Global Change Research Program, which coordinates climate change research.

The ballot features two questions. The first question asks voters whether or not to recall Newsom. The second gives voters a choice between more than 40 candidates about who should replace him, if he is recalled.
While many have already voted early by mail or in person -- ballots arrived in the mailboxes of every registered California voter last month -- others will cast their ballots Tuesday.

At the core of the law is the empowerment of private citizens to bring lawsuits against people who assist someone in getting an abortion after the state's six-week window. It also provides 
monetary rewards of up to $10,000
 for those who bring the suits.
People really don't like either of those provisions, according to 
new national polling from Monmouth University
.
Fully 
70%
 of Americans disagree with the idea of allowing private citizens to bring lawsuits against abortion providers. That numbers includes 9 in 10 Democrats, yes, but also more than 4 in 10 Republicans.
Opposition to paying off these complainants is even higher in the poll, with 
81%
 disapproving of the idea -- including 2 in 3 (67%) of self-identified Republicans.
Those sorts of overwhelming majorities -- particularly on an issue as divisive as abortion rights -- are essentially unheard of, but speak to a bipartisan sense in the public that Texas Republicans went too far.
Remarkably, in spite of those numbers, at least 
seven other Republican-controlled states
 have expressed interest in following Texas' lead on its abortion law.
And in Missouri, 
a federal judge is expected to rule on Tuesday
 as to whether a 2019 law that effectively bans abortion after eight weeks can begin to be implemented.
The Point
: At minimum, the Texas law will serve as a base-motivating tool for Democrats who are in search of energy in advance of the critical 2022 midterms. At most, the law -- and other potential copycats around the country -- could jeopardize the GOP's ability to win over swing voters.

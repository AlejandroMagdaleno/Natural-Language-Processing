With the exception of SALT-I, he played major and minor roles in each of the most consequential arms treaties between the two nuclear powers over the past 50 years. He previously met with Russian President Vladimir Putin when Biden was vice president and Putin was prime minister.
This time, however, Biden met with Putin as an equal rather than as another president's envoy. This week was the first major test of how well Biden's extensive background serves him at a particularly 
low point
 in US-Russia relations amid 
cyberattacks emanating from Russia
 and the 
treatment of opposition leader Alexey Navalny
. 
What do Biden's previous years of Russian experience tell us about his approach today? As both a senator and vice president, he was frequently dispatched to Russia as a diplomatic closer. While not always successful, he has played a leading role in shaping US foreign policy, especially with the expansion of NATO and the negotiation and ratification of arms treaties.

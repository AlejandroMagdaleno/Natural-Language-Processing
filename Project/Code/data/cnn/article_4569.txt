"The Newsoms were concerned to see unvaccinated children unmasked indoors at a camp their children began attending yesterday and after seeing this, removed the kids from the camp," his spokesperson Erin Mellon said in a statement Wednesday. 
Newsom, a Democrat, 
faces a recall election
 later this year that was motivated in large part by his Covid-19 measures. The camp issue was raised after a group opposed to California's pandemic preventative measures for K-12 schools had drawn attention to his children's attendance at the camp.
"This is in clear violation of his own mask mandates. Why can his kid be maskless, but not ours?" the group, Reopen California Schools, posted on 
Twitter
 earlier this week.
Mellon said the Newsom family "reviewed communication from the camp and realized that an email was missed saying the camp would not enforce masking guidance."
"Their kids will no longer be attending this camp," she added. 
Face coverings are required indoors for K-12 schools, childcare and other youth settings, according to guidance from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).
CNN has requested more information from the CDPH. It is not immediately clear if the camp would be found in violation of state guidelines.
Newsom had to 
apologize
 last year for flouting his state-imposed Covid-19 restrictions at the time by dining at a restaurant in close quarters with other households. 
In April, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had 
recommended that everyone at summer camps 
should wear masks and socially distance and that camp activities should be outdoors as much as possible, given that vaccines are not yet authorized for children of all ages.
Several recent outbreaks of Covid-19 infections have been at summer camps -- including in 
Texas
, 
New York
 and
 Illinois 
-- among unvaccinated children and staffers.

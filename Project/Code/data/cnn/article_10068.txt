Here are key things to know:
Ghost guns are self-assembled firearms, often put together with parts sold online
They don't have serial numbers
Purchases of kits or individual parts do not require a background check, meaning they can essentially be bought by anyone
Some ghost guns can be fabricated in as little as 30 minutes using kits and parts purchased online
The use of ghost guns is on the rise in major cities, like 
Baltimore
 and 
Philadelphia
. And in 
2019, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said
 that nearly a third of the guns now recovered by agents in California are unserialized.
Biden is directing the Justice Department to issue a proposed rule to "stop the proliferation" of those weapons, though a senior administration official previewing the action on Wednesday declined to elaborate on how specifically the rule -- due in 30 days -- might work.
The move is in line with recommendations from gun safety advocacy groups who are consulting with the White House, including 
Everytown for Gun Safety
 and 
Giffords: Courage to Fight Gun Violence
.
Biden's actions come amid mounting pressure to act in the wake of a series of mass shootings around the country. 
While campaigning, Biden said he would task his attorney general with instituting better enforcement of existing gun laws as a means of slowing gun violence. He also made a campaign pledge to send $900 million for community programs meant to combat violence, something the administration is sorting out how to fulfill.
Gun safety advocates say that the Biden administration can take action almost immediately to address a number of issues Biden brought up on the campaign trail.

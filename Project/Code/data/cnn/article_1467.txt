"I recently tested positive for #COVID19, and am grateful to only have mild symptoms, which I credit to the vaccine," Soto said. "I am currently self-isolating and working remotely. I encourage everyone to #GetVaccinated to save lives!" 
Soto is the 
sixth member of the House
 to have had a breakthrough Covid-19 diagnosis since early August. 
Four senators have also contracted 
the virus after being vaccinated.
Soto says he's also receiving monoclonal antibody treatment, but stresses that it is "not a substitutive for the COVID-19 vaccine."
"This morning I also received monoclonal antibody treatment to further reduce potential symptoms. This treatment is helpful but not a substitute for the COVID-19 vaccine. I encourage everyone to get vaccinated as soon as possible: Vaccines.gov."

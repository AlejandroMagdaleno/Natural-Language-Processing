Democrats are protecting what is effectively a four-seat margin in the chamber. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also said last week that it had broken its own record, but its total -- $36.5 million -- for the quarter is about $9 million short of its Republican counterpart. 
The NRCC said it had $55 million on hand, the highest ever at this point in the election cycle, compared with the DCCC's $44 million. Both political organizations said they were not in debt.
Republican Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the NRCC chairman, praised his House GOP colleagues and "tens of thousands of generous donors" for the massive haul. 
House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy 
of California transferred $6.6 million to the NRCC in the second quarter and House GOP Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana sent in $4.5 million.
"Voters are doing everything they can to help House Republicans retake the House," Emmer told CNN. "They want to stop the Democrats' socialist agenda and, once and for all, they want to fire Nancy Pelosi. They've had enough." 
Last week, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, the DCCC chairman, said its fundraising was "strong" and that "American voters are rejecting Republican extremism and know just how critical a Democratic House majority is to protecting our democracy and delivering for American families."
This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.

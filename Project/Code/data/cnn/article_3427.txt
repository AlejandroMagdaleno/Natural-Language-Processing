A sizable 62% of Americans support the $1.2 trillion measure,
 according to a new Fox News poll
.
Breaking down the numbers, and to little surprise, Democrats overwhelmingly support it (87%), followed by a majority of independents (63%) and some Republicans (37%).
And despite efforts to push through the 
$3.5 trillion budget reconciliation package
 on a party-line vote, the poll also finds a majority of Americans (56%) say they support the additional infrastructure items in the House-bound bill with spending to address climate change, health care and child care.
The bulk of that support comes from Democrats (88%) and independents (60%) -- and significantly drops among Republicans, to 24%.
The Point
: The hard-fought bipartisan infrastructure bill still 
faces hurdles in the House
, but polling finds good news for 
proponents
: Most Americans are on board with the effort.

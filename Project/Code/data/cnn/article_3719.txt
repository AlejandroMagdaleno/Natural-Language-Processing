Khan, who 
endorsed Biden 
in 2020, said in 2016 that Trump "sacrificed nothing and no one," before raising a copy of the US Constitution, asking if Trump had ever read it. Khan's son, Army Capt. Humayun Khan, died in Baghdad in 2004.
The White House on Friday recognized Khan, a founder of the Constitution Literacy and National Unity Project, as "an advocate for religious freedom as a core element of human dignity." The announcement said that Khan "devotes a substantial amount of his time to providing legal services to veterans, men and women serving in uniform, and their families."
It continued: "Today's announcement underscores the President's commitment to build an Administration that looks like America and reflects people of all faiths."
In addition to Khan, the White House nominated Rashad Hussain to serve as the first Muslim Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom and Deborah Lipstadt to serve as the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism.

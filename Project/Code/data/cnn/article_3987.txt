"What I want to do is I'mÂ trying to bring the countryÂ together, and I don't want the debate toÂ only be about whether or not weÂ have a filibuster or exceptionsÂ to the filibuster or going backÂ to the way the filibuster had toÂ be used before," Biden told CNN's Don Lemon at a CNN town hall in Cincinnati. 
The President said: "There's no reason to protectÂ it other than you're going toÂ throw the entire Congress intoÂ chaos and nothing will get done. Nothing at all will get done.Â And there's a lot at stake.Â The most important one is the rightÂ to vote, that's the single most importantÂ one."

He again slammed Republicans who are attempting to curb voting rights across the country, calling it "Jim Crow on steroids." RepublicansÂ at the state level have moved since the 2020 election to 
roll back easy access toÂ votingÂ 
or install new obstacles in the way ofÂ voters. 
Biden called on Congress
 to pass the For the People Act and the John LewisÂ Voting Rights AdvancementÂ Act to block the nationwide assault on voting rights.
"Never before has there been anÂ attempt by state legislatures toÂ take over the ability toÂ determine who won.Â Not count the votes, determineÂ who won," he said. 
The President said: "This is Jim Crow on steroids,Â what we're talking about."
Biden said he wants to "make sure we bring along notÂ just all the Democrats, we bringÂ along Republicans who I knowÂ know better.Â They know better than this."
But there is currently no Republican support in the US Senate for voting rights legislation and Democrats do not have the votes to overcome the 60-vote filibuster. As a result, some Democrats are pushing the President to back changing the Senate filibuster rules. But some Democrats, including 
Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia
 and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, say weakening the filibuster rules is something they will not support. 
Biden has faced increasing pressure from Black leaders to take a strong stance on Congress eliminating the filibuster in order to pass federal legislation to protect voters.
The President delivered a 
high-profile speech earlier this month
 on protecting voting rights but did not mention the filibuster. Some Black civil rights leaders praised him for taking a strong stance against voter suppression in his speech but said he fell short of meeting their demand to discuss the filibuster. 
"I've been saying for a long,Â long time the abuse of theÂ filibuster is prettyÂ overwhelming," Biden said Wednesday night. He said that when he had first joined the Senate there were fewer filibusters because it was a talking filibuster, which required a senator who wants to block legislation to hold the floor without taking a break.

Consider this:
* Congress passed -- and Biden signed into law -- the 
$1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan
.Â 
* The Senate passed -- and the House is debating -- a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal that would fund much-needed repairs and updates on roads and bridges (and the like).
* Senate and House Democrats are considering a budget bill that is likely to total somewhere between $1.5 trillion and $3.5 trillion -- probably closer to the lower number, if I had to make an educated guess -- in additional spending.
Add it up and, on the conservative end, you get almost
 $4.5 trillion
 in additional government spending in the first year of Biden's first term, to be disbursed over a decade.
And it will add massive sums to the federal budget deficit. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bipartisan infrastructure bill 
will add more than $250 billion
 to the deficit. In March alone, the 
federal government spent $660 billion more than it took in
 -- largely due to provisions of the American Rescue Plan.
Here's some context for those massive sums: In October 1981, after two centuries of deficit spending, 
the national debt hit $1 trillion
. The current national debt is more than 
$28 trillion
.
Biden and his allies will insist that this massive outlay of federal spending is necessary as the country seeks to get back on its collective feet following almost two years of shutdowns and slowdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic.
And that may be true! But it doesn't change the fact that if Biden gets anything close to what he wants out of the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the budget package, he will have remade the role government plays in the lives of its citizens.
The Point
: Biden campaigned as a return to normal business in the 2020 election. But his expansive domestic agenda -- and its mighty price tag -- is anything but vanilla.

And Trump, we were told, 
had learned his lesson
 from his incitement of a violent riot -- and wouldn't do anything like that again.Â 
Except that when 
Trump actually spoke publicly for the first time since the riot last Wednesday
, he was neither remorseful nor reflective. He was who he has always been: a grievance-driven egotist who is quick to cast blame even while never accepting any for himself.
"So if you read my speech -- and many people have done it, and I've seen it both in the papers and in the media, on television -- it's been analyzed, and people thought that what I said was totally appropriate," Trump said Tuesday before leaving for a visit to the Texas border. (This is, of course, wholly inaccurate.)
Then he added: "They've analyzed my speech and words and my final paragraph, my final sentence, and everybody, to the 'T', thought it was totally appropriate."
(Side note: Who the heck is this "they?")
Trump also veered into his favorite subject -- how he was right. In this case about his de-platforming by Twitter and Facebook. "They're dividing and divisive, and they're showing something that I've been predicting for a long time," he said. "I've been predicting it for a long time, and people didn't act on it."
Trump's comments should function as your now almost daily reminder that there is absolutely no bottom when it comes to this President and how low he will go.
His final days in the White House have functioned as proof-positive of this fact. He is not remorseful. He is not sorry. He is not anything other than convinced he is right and everyone else in the world is wrong.
The Point
: There. Is. No. Bottom. Never has been.

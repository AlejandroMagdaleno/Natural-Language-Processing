Trump, the only child of the President and his second wife, Marla Maples, was primarily raised by Maples in California. She graduated from Georgetown Law School in May 2020, and though she's largely kept a low profile over the last four years compared to her older siblings, she stepped into the political spotlight over the summer when she 
spoke
 at the Republican National Convention. 
"Our generation is unified in facing the future in uncertain times -- and many of us are considering what kind of country we want to live in. As a recent graduate, I can relate to so many of you who might be looking for a job. My father built a thriving economy once, and believe me, he will do it again," she said at the time, urging Americans to vote "based on results and not rhetoric." 
Trump also made multiple stops as a campaign surrogate in the weeks before the election. 
Trump, 27, and Boulos, 23, have been spotted together at multiple events with the first family, from holidays at Mar-a-Lago to the State of the Union address. 
The couple's plans after the Trump presidency were not immediately clear.

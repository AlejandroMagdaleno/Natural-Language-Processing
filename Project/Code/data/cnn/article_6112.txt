The 28 total laws in 17 states mark a new record for restrictive voting laws since 2011, when the Brennan Center 
recorded 19 laws enacted in 14 state legislatures
. 
More than half of these new laws make it harder to vote absentee and by mail, after a record number of Americans voted by mail in November.
The legislative push is part of a national 
Republican effort to restrict access
 to the ballot box following record turnout in the 2020 election. Republicans currently 
control both chambers of 30 state legislatures
.
State lawmakers are expected to attempt enacting additional laws this year.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has announced he will 
convene a special session
 of the state legislature on July 8. The Republican governor has promised to revive a slew of new voting restrictions effectively killed by Democrats during the regular legislative session, 
tweeting late last month
 that he would be adding "election integrity" to a list of topics lawmakers will address.

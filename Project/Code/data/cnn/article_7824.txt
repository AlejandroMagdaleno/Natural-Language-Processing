The comments, made in a 
since-deleted Facebook live from summer 2019 
that was saved by CNN's KFile, were in response to remarks made by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York in which she 
compared migrant detention facilities
 to concentration camps.   
"She should be shamed by everyone. That she's actually using those terms and making that comparison," Greene said. "And I think it's an embarrassment to our country, that we actually have a congresswoman that would do such a thing. And I'm calling her out big time.  
"I think everyone should call her out. She should never ever make that comparison. It's insulting, extremely insulting to the families who have family members that were murdered or survived concentration camps. And that just shows you a lot about who she is as a person. And then also anyone that agrees with her and the Democrat party."
Greene's office did not return a request for comment from CNN.
In a podcast interview last week, Greene compared House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's 
decision to continue to require members
 of the House to wear masks on the chamber floor to steps the Nazis took to control the Jewish population during the Holocaust.  
On Tuesday, House Republican leaders condemned those inflammatory remarks from Greene. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy called her comments "appalling."  
Greene again defended 
her comments on Tuesday
, saying in a series of tweets that "attempts to shame, ostracize, and brand Americans who choose not to get vaccinated or wear a mask are reminiscent of the great tyrants of history who did the same to those who would not comply."

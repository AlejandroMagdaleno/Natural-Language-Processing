The soldiers drank a substance during a field training exercise "thinking they were drinking an alcoholic beverage," the statement read, noting alcohol is banned on such exercises. Subsequent toxicology tests revealed the presence of ethylene glycol. Nine other soldiers are also being treated at the hospital in a non-critical care unit as part of the incident.
"The circumstances of how the Soldiers ingested the substance are under investigation by the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (USACIDC). There is no reason to believe there is any threat to the greater Fort Bliss community," the statement read.
Located in El Paso, Texas, Fort Bliss is home to the 1st Armored Division, "America's Tank Division."
The unit was undergoing a field training exercise Thursday when the incident happened. 
"We took immediate action to treat everyone involved with the best medical care available," Maj. Gen. Sean C. Bernabe, senior mission commander of the 1st Armored Division and Fort Bliss, said in the statement.

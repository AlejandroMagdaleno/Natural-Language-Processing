The town hall comes as the White House grapples with a new surge in Covid-19 cases, which has led to increasing rates of hospitalizations and deaths. The 
Delta variant
, which causes more severe illness than Covid-19, is spreading in areas of the nation with low vaccination rates. 
More than 161 million Americans are now fully vaccinated against Covid-19, but many are still refusing to get the shot. The White House has ramped up efforts to conduct more targeted outreach, particularly to young people, and to combat misinformation about the vaccines. 
The town hall comes as the administration faces a number of congressional hurdles, including on immigration, police reform and infrastructure. 
The one-hour long event is expected to focus on a wide range of issues facing theÂ nation, including Covid-19 and the economy.

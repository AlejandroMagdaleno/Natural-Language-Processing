But even as the new Congress begins, its roster will likely remain unsettled for months. 
There will be two vacancies in the House: New York's 22nd District will not have representation as legal challenges in the race continue, and Louisiana's 5th District will not have representation due to the 
death of Republican Rep.-elect Luke Letlow
. In the Senate, one of Georgia's Senate seats will be vacant as Republican Sen. David Perdue battles in a runoff for the seat on January 5.
Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler is also running in Georgia's dual runoff elections Tuesday. Perdue's term finished at the end of the 116th Congress, so he is not included in the new Congress' numbers. Loeffler's term will continue unless she is defeated Tuesday, so she is counted. 
In other changes to congressional rosters in the coming weeks, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be stepping down from her Senate seat to be 
replaced
 by California Secretary of State Alex Padilla. 
And in the House, three Democratic members are expected to leave office to take on 
roles in the new Biden administration
: Rep. 
Cedric Richmond
 of Louisiana (2nd Congressional District) to be White House senior adviser and director of the Office of Public Engagement; Rep.
 Deb Haaland
 of New Mexico (1st Congressional District) to be Secretary of the Interior; and Rep.
 Marcia Fudge
 of Ohio (11th Congressional District) to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

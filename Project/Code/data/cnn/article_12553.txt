The "CNN Presidential Town Hall with Joe Biden" will be moderated by Anderson Cooper and will air live at 9 p.m. ET. 
The town hall comes as the 
Biden administration
 continues its push to vaccinate every American, contain the coronavirus pandemic, jump-start a troubled economy and reopen schools. 
With the conclusion of former President Donald Trump's 
second impeachment trial
, the Democratic-controlled Senate can now turn to working on 
Biden's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package
 and confirming the rest of Biden's Cabinet nominees.
Senators on Saturday voted that Trump was not guilty of inciting the deadly January 6 riot at the US Capitol, but the verdict still amounted to a bipartisan rebuke of the former President, with seven Republicans finding him guilty.

The suspect, whose name has not been released, died after being transported to a hospital, the FBI said in a statement Tuesday. Additional details were not provided.
The suspect initially drove up to the CIA's gates late Monday morning and made statements suggesting there was a bomb in their vehicle, according to a law enforcement official and another source familiar with the incident, touching off an hours-long standoff.

With coronavirus cases again surging among unvaccinated Americans and America's vaccination rate now lagging behind countries like Canada and the UK, the people who haven't yet gotten vaccinated are rightfully getting a lot of focus. But it's also worth pulling back briefly to note that, in a span of less than a year, the vast majority of adults across the country have participated in the Covid-19 vaccine campaign.
In a diverse, often culturally fractured society, it's not that easy to get 70% of Americans to hear about, agree with or do almost anything. Having been vaccinated, in fact, has rapidly become among the most common shared experiences of people across the country. If adults who've gotten a Covid-19 shot were an electoral bloc, they'd be well into landslide popular vote territory.
As a bit of extra context, here's a list of some things American adults are less likely to have in common than being vaccinated, according to polls:
53% planned to watch this year's Super Bowl (

Most adults in the US who wanted a vaccine have already gotten one, and convincing or compelling the remaining unvaccinated to follow suit will be an increasingly uphill struggle.
 But if the vaccination rate continues to tick upward, we're only a few points from making getting a Covid shot as commonplace an American experience as putting up a Christmas tree or flying a kite.

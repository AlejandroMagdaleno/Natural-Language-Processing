Gen. Jay Raymond, commander of the US Space Force, announced the new uniforms during his speech at the Air Force Association's Air, Space and Cyber conference. 
The new dress uniform prototype is a navy-blue uniform. It has a series of silver buttons with the US Space Force symbol on them running diagonally from the right shoulder down the front of the wearer's chest. The name pin is on the left side of the uniform's front under the wearer's left shoulder. A light blue collar is slightly visible below the uniform.
The US Space Force also announced physical training uniform prototypes. The physical training uniform is more casual. It includes a T-shirt with the US Space Force symbol on the right side of the shirt's front and Space Force written in capital white letters across the back. The shorts and sweatshirt are black, and both include the US Space Force symbol on them.
Second Lt. Mahala Norris models the physical training uniform prototype in a short promotional video that the US Space Force tweeted from its account.
The US Space Force called the dress uniforms "modern, distinctive," and "professional" in a tweet.

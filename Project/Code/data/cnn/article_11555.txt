"So, as you know, it's pretty windy outside, it's very windy. I almost fell coming up the steps myself," she said while briefings reporters on the plane on the way to Atlanta. "He is doing 100% fine."
Jean-Pierre wouldn't say if he hurt the foot that was recently broken.
"He's doing great. All I can tell you is he's doing fine. He's preparing for the trip today and he is doing just great," she said in response to a question.
She repeated that he's doing just fine when asked if Biden got checked out by a doctor.

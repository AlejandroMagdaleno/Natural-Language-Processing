"I don't know all the circumstances that were considered, but it seems to me, under the guidelines, that seems to be appropriate," Biden said in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon. However, he also said he hadn't heard anything about the news until press relayed it when they entered the room. 
Chauvin was sentenced to 22-and-a-half years for the second-degree unintentional murder of Floyd.  
Chauvin had been found guilty 
on that charge in April, as well as third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Sentences for the lesser charges were not handed down on Friday.
The President 
notably broke his careful silence 
about the eventual outcome of the Chauvin trial this spring, saying he was "praying the verdict is the right verdict," and suggested there was ample evidence for the jury to consider as it determined whether the former officer was guilty of murdering Floyd.
"It's overwhelming, in my view," Biden said at the time. "I wouldn't say that unless the jury was sequestered."
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris met with Floyd's family in May on the anniversary of his death at the hands of police, which sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality.
Federal policing measures that were proposed following the demonstrations remain in negotiations in Congress. Congressional negotiators working on
 legislation aimed at overhauling the nation's policing laws 
said on Thursday that they've "reached agreement on a framework" for the package but that talks will continue over the next few weeks.

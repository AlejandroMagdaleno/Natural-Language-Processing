Some members of 
President Biden's
 
Supreme Court
 commission Friday railed against the framing of wide-ranging discussion materials it released Thursday night on 
court-packing
, alleging that it focused too much on partisan politics rather than institutional confidence, as others alleged it's "biased" against court-packing.
"This entire discussion is framed in the context of partisan politics. And I actually think that is a disservice to the exploration of this issue," NAACP Legal Defense Fund President Sherrilyn Ifill said about the chapter on court-packing. She said that many of those who favor court-packing have "genuine concerns" about rule of law and other issues.Â 
"There are many reasons why one might support the idea of expanding the court that don't have to do with your being beholden to a particular partisan agenda," she added. "You've basically allowed people to check out from the arguments that actually relate to the legitimacy of the Supreme Court."
"Although my guess that Commissioner Ifill and I probably disagree on the merits of court expansion, I couldn't agree more with her comment about the way the issue is framed," replied former D.C. Circuit Judge Thomas Griffith, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush and opposes court-packing.

"It's framed in this partisan way of looking at this as Democrats vs. Republicans ... too much of this discussion draft reinforces the assumptions of many that the justices are partisans just looking for ways to advance the policy agendas of the president who appointed them," he continued. "It's inaccurateâ¦ The Supreme Court has played well its vital role. It has repeatedly demonstrated a commitment to the rule of lawâ¦ This is the time to build confidence in this report. Too frequently elements of this draft report do just the opposite."
Other liberal commissioners, including Harvard Law Professor Andrew Crespo, said that they simply think the draft materials were unfairly biased against court-packing. He alleged that the discussion materials' framing "distorts" the debate because it does not seriously consider "the most salient and most viable intervention on the table" in court-packing.Â 
Crespo alleged that Republicans packed the Supreme Court "twice" in recent years with political hardball tactics, despite the fact the widely-accepted definition of court-packing is Congress adding justices to the court out of dissatisfaction with unfavorable rulings to the party in power. Duke Law School Professor David Levi responded to this point later in the discussion, saying that it is unfair to call leaving a seat open ahead of a presidential election â as Republicans did in 2016 â court packing. He noted that ahead of an election it is normal for a Senate of the opposite party of the president to decline to confirm nominees for lower courts, and that is not considered court-packing.Â 
Former U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, meanwhile, alleged that the Supreme Court is "enabling" Republicans to "secure a tactical advantage" in elections with state-level election laws.
The discussion materials presented a mixed view on court-packing, which ahead of the meeting drew backlash from some progressives who believe Biden and Democrats in Congress should pack the court with multiple liberal justices after Republicans confirmed three justices during former President Donald Trump's tenure.Â 
Co-Chairman Bob Bauer, who a former White House Counsel under former President Barack Obama, opened the Friday meeting by pushing back on the 
criticism of the discussion materials.

PROGRESSIVES FUME AS BIDEN SUPREME COURT COMMISSION SEEMS TO REJECT COURT-PACKING
"The commission has not edited the material and the material should not be understood to represent the commission's views or those of any particular commissioner," Bauer said. "To this point and particularly in light of some confusion and uncertainty since the posting of these materials, we refer you to the front page of each of the drafts that have been publicly posted that clearly set forth these points."
Bauer added that the materials are "not the commission's drafts nor a draft report of the commission."
The meeting opened at 10 a.m. with discussion of the reason many are calling for court reform. Most of the substantive discussion on court-packing happened from 11:10 a.m. and 12:50 p.m. as the commissioners deliberated "Membership and Size of the Court," according to the public agenda of the meeting.Â 
"It turns out that a vocal minority of commissioners arenât willing to let court-packing go," Cato Institute Vice President Ilya Shapiro told Fox News in response to the discussion. "Larry Tribe evocatively called it a âbreak the glassâ moment, where we effectively need to break norms to remedy alleged broken norms. The final report will thus likely reflect less of an anti-court-packing lean."
Shapiro added: "Adam Whiteâs description of a âhecklerâs veto theory of legitimacyâ is evocative: so much of the current call for reform is driven by upset (and even outrage) over the direction of political and legal developments."

Later in the day the commission will also debate potential reforms related to term limits for justices, potential rotation of justices, case selection and the Supreme Court's broader role within the Untied States' system of government.Â

Several 
congressmen
, including members of both political parties, were denied access to 
Afghan
 refugees at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, Republican California Rep. Darrell Issa told Fox News.Â 
Issa told Fox News in a Thursday phone call that he is "frustrated that the administration decided to deny us oversight of the remaining refugees here or any real access to these centers."Â 
Issa's office said they began outreach to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) and the U.S. Embassy in Qatar for the trip back in September, but only found out this week that they would be denied access to the refugees.Â 
"Nobody said that there would be a problem with DOD until after we were here and then they started talking about how they were in the final stages and didn't have the resources, basically they didn't want us to meet with refugees and hear their stories," Issa said.Â 
STATE DEPT TRYING TO STEAL CREDIT FOR RESCUE OF 4 AMERICANS FROM AFGHANISTAN, ORGANIZER SAYS: âTOTAL LIEâÂ 
The congressman said his fellow Californian, Democratic Rep. Lou Correa, was among those in attendance.Â 
"There are tens of thousands of Afghans brought in this country, that the administration flew here, and they have no idea who they are. Now, they are holding refugee camp on an American military base, and they don't want us to know who they are," an Issa staffer told Fox News.Â

Republicans have raised serious concerns in recent weeks about the 
Biden administration's
 vetting of Afghan refugees. Those concerns have only intensified after 
two Afghan men were arrested
, one for sex crimes with a minor and the other for domestic abuse.Â 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas revealed last month that 
only 3%
 of the over 60,000 Afghan evacuees brought to the United States following the end of the war in Afghanistan have been special immigrant visa recipients.
"Approximately 6 percent have been lawful permanent residents. Approximately 3 percent have been individuals who are in receipt of the special immigrant visas," Mayorkas said during congressional testimony at the time.
A CENTCOM spokesman didn't return Fox News' request for comment by press time.Â

Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels says 10,000 pounds of fentanyl have been seized at the border this fiscal year. He says 'willful neglect' from the Biden administration is causing the crisis.
The 
Department of Homeland Security
 says it is ready to reinstate the Trump-era "Remain in Mexico" policy by mid-November in response to a court order upheld by the 
Supreme Court
 â even as it works to abolish the program by a different method.
A federal judge on Friday ordered the Biden administration to "enforce and implement" what is formally called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) in response to a 
lawsuit
 from Texas and Missouri, which claimed that the administrationâs attempt to terminate the policy was illegal and harmful. The Supreme Court upheld the ruling.
ARIZONA AG CALLS FOR DOJ TO PROBE FACEBOOK AFTER IT SAYS USERS CAN SHARE INFO ON HOW TO ENTER US ILLEGALLY
MPP was established and 
expanded in 2019
 by the Trump administration and involved sending migrants back to Mexico, rather than being released into the U.S., as their immigration proceedings were heard. The Biden administration began unraveling it earlier this year, even amid soaring migrant numbers, and formally ended it in June before the court ruling ordered a reversal.
Proponents described the policy as incredibly effective, by weeding out bogus or insufficient asylum claims without letting people into the country, and one that helped end the process of "catch and release." Amid the ongoing border crisis, which has seen hundreds of thousands of migrants hit the border in recent months, with tens of thousands being released into the U.S., Republicans and border officials have urged the Biden administration to re-implement the policy.

However, critics called the process inhumane and one that left migrants open to violence and exploitation on the Mexican side of the border by cartels and other criminals, where migrants gathered in de facto camps.
In a 
filing on Thursday
, the Biden administration said it had made "substantial progress" in re-implementing MPP, even as it says it is seeking alternative ways to end the program.
The filing said it had engaged in talks with Mexico, finalized operational plans and has also issued a task order to rebuild the soft-sided facilities (which were commonly referred to as "court tents") in Laredo and Brownsville, Texas to the tune of $14.1 million -- with a predicted $10.5 million a month in operational costs.

"As a result of this progress, DHS anticipates being in a position to re-implement MPP by mid-November dependent on decisions made by Mexico."
Missouri, who along with Texas, sued DHS over the ending of MPP, accused the administration of having "slow-walked" compliance with the order.
"In April, we sued the Biden Administration over their cancellation of the âRemain in Mexicoâ policy and won at the district court, 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, and at the United States Supreme Court, requiring the Biden Administration to reimplement the policy," Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement. "Despite multiple courts ordering the Biden Administration to reimplement the policy, they have repeatedly slow-walked that reimplementation."Â 
"The âRemain in Mexicoâ Policy should be implemented today, especially as the crisis at the border continues to worsen every single day. We have taken concrete action to secure the border, it's time for the Biden Administration to do the same," he said.
The DHS filing on Thursday emphasized that "DHS cannot implement MPP without Mexicoâs independent decision to accept individuals that the United States seeks to send to Mexico" and will need its concurrence on how many entries will be permitted and who will be accepted for return.
They say Mexico has identified a number of changes it would like to see made to MPP, including better coordination and an assurance that cases are generally adjudicated within six months of enrollment.

In a statement DHS said it is taking "necessary steps" to comply with the order, despite its appeal and efforts to end the policy.
"As announced previously, DHS also will be issuing a memorandum terminating MPP," a spokeperson said, adding that it would not take effect until the injunction is lifted.

"Despite multiple courts ordering the Biden Administration to reimplement the policy, they have repeatedly slow-walked that reimplementation."Â 
"The âRemain in Mexicoâ Policy should be implemented today, especially as the crisis at the border continues to worsen every single day. We have taken concrete action to secure the border, it's time for the Biden Administration to do the same," he said.
The DHS filing on Thursday emphasized that "DHS cannot implement MPP without Mexicoâs independent decision to accept individuals that the United States seeks to send to Mexico" and will need its concurrence on how many entries will be permitted and who will be accepted for return.
They say Mexico has identified a number of changes it would like to see made to MPP, including better coordination and an assurance that cases are generally adjudicated within six months of enrollment.

In a statement DHS said it is taking "necessary steps" to comply with the order, despite its appeal and efforts to end the policy.

Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels says 10,000 pounds of fentanyl have been seized at the border this fiscal year. He says 'willful neglect' from the Biden administration is causing the crisis.
The 
Department of Homeland Security
 says it is ready to reinstate the Trump-era "Remain in Mexico" policy by mid-November in response to a court order upheld by the 
Supreme Court
 â even as it works to abolish the program by a different method.
A federal judge on Friday ordered the Biden administration to "enforce and implement" what is formally called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) in response to a 
lawsuit
 from Texas and Missouri, which claimed that the administrationâs attempt to terminate the policy was illegal and harmful. The Supreme Court upheld the ruling.

MPP was established and 
expanded in 2019
 by the Trump administration and involved sending migrants back to Mexico, rather than being released into the U.S., as their immigration proceedings were heard. The Biden administration began unraveling it earlier this year, even amid soaring migrant numbers, and formally ended it in June before the court ruling ordered a reversal.
Proponents described the policy as incredibly effective, by weeding out bogus or insufficient asylum claims without letting people into the country, and one that helped end the process of "catch and release." Amid the ongoing border crisis, which has seen hundreds of thousands of migrants hit the border in recent months, with tens of thousands being released into the U.S., Republicans and border officials have urged the Biden administration to re-implement the policy.

However, critics called the process inhumane and one that left migrants open to violence and exploitation on the Mexican side of the border by cartels and other criminals, where migrants gathered in de facto camps.
In a 
filing on Thursday
, the Biden administration said it had made "substantial progress" in re-implementing MPP, even as it says it is seeking alternative ways to end the program.
The filing said it had engaged in talks with Mexico, finalized operational plans and has also issued a task order to rebuild the soft-sided facilities (which were commonly referred to as "court tents") in Laredo and Brownsville, Texas to the tune of $14.1 million -- with a predicted $10.5 million a month in operational costs.

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) â 
The Biden administration said Friday it will turn next to the U.S. Supreme Court in another attempt to halt a 
Texas
 law that has banned most 
abortions
 since September.Â 
It comes as the Texas clinics are running out of avenues to stop the GOP-engineered law that bans abortions once cardiac activity is detected, which is usually around six weeks. It amounts to the nation's biggest curb to abortion in nearly 50 years.
The latest defeat for clinics came Thursday night when a federal appeals panel in New Orleans, in a 2-1 decision, allowed the restrictions to remain in place for a third time in the last several weeks alone.Â 
Justice Department
 spokesman Anthony Coley said the federal government will now ask the Supreme Court to reverse that decision but did not say how quickly.
5TH CIRCUIT COURT GRANTS A STAY, ALLOWS TEXAS ABORTION BILL TO GO INTO EFFECT
The Biden administration was under pressure from abortion rights supporters to go to the Supreme Court even before the announcement. The court already once allowed the restrictions to take effect, but did so without ruling on the law's constitutionality.Â

Since the law took effect Sept. 1, Texas women have sought out abortion clinics in neighboring states, some driving hours through the middle of the night and including patients as young as 12 years old. The law makes no exception for cases of rape or incest.
The Texas Attorney General's Office called the decision Thursday night by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals a "testament that we are on the right side of the law and life."Â 
A 1992 decision by the Supreme Court prevented states from banning abortion before viability, the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb, around 24 weeks of pregnancy. But Texas' version has outmaneuvered courts so far due to the fact that it offloads enforcement to private citizens. Anyone who brings a successful lawsuit against an abortion provider for violating the law is entitled to claim at least $10,000 in damages, which the Biden administration says amounts to a bounty.
Only once has a court moved to put the restrictions on hold â and that order only stood for 48 hours.
SEN. JOSH HAWLEY TELLS RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES NATION NEEDS A âBAPTISM OF COURAGEâ
During that brief window, some Texas clinics rushed to perform abortions on patients past six weeks, but many more appointments were canceled after the 5th Circuit moved to swiftly reinstate the law last week.
Texas had roughly two dozen abortion clinics before the law took effect, and operators have said some may be forced to close if the restrictions stay in place for much longer.
Already the stakes are high in the coming months over the future of abortion rights in the U.S. In December, the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court will hear Mississippi's bid to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that guarantees a woman's right to an abortion.
Texas Right to Life, the state's largest anti-abortion group, set up a tip line to receive allegations against abortion providers but has not filed any lawsuits. Kimberlyn Schwartz, a spokeswoman, said Thursday the group expected the Biden administration to go to the Supreme Court next and was "confident Texas will ultimately defeat these attacks on our life-saving efforts."

On Wednesday, 18 state attorneys generals from mostly GOP-controlled states threw new support behind the Texas law, urging the court to let the restrictions stand while accusing the federal government of overstepping in bringing the challenge in the first place. Last month, more than 20 other states, mostly run by Democrats, had urged the lower court to throw out the law.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has called the law "clearly unconstitutional" and warned that it could become a model elsewhere in the country unless it's struck down.

Some members of 
President Biden's
 
Supreme Court
 commission Friday railed against the framing of wide-ranging discussion materials it released Thursday night on 
court-packing
, alleging that it focused too much on partisan politics rather than institutional confidence, as others alleged it's "biased" against court-packing.
"This entire discussion is framed in the context of partisan politics. And I actually think that is a disservice to the exploration of this issue," NAACP Legal Defense Fund President Sherrilyn Ifill said about the chapter on court-packing. She said that many of those who favor court-packing have "genuine concerns" about rule of law and other issues.Â 
"There are many reasons why one might support the idea of expanding the court that don't have to do with your being beholden to a particular partisan agenda," she added. "You've basically allowed people to check out from the arguments that actually relate to the legitimacy of the Supreme Court."
"Although my guess that Commissioner Ifill and I probably disagree on the merits of court expansion, I couldn't agree more with her comment about the way the issue is framed," replied former D.C. Circuit Judge Thomas Griffith, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush and opposes court-packing.

BOSTON BOMBER: BARRETT ASKS DOJ LAWYER WHY BIDEN ADMIN WANTS TO REINSTATE DEATH SENTENCE AMID EXECUTION PAUSE
"It's framed in this partisan way of looking at this as Democrats vs. Republicans ... too much of this discussion draft reinforces the assumptions of many that the justices are partisans just looking for ways to advance the policy agendas of the president who appointed them," he continued. "It's inaccurateâ¦ The Supreme Court has played well its vital role. It has repeatedly demonstrated a commitment to the rule of lawâ¦ This is the time to build confidence in this report. Too frequently elements of this draft report do just the opposite."
Other liberal commissioners, including Harvard Law Professor Andrew Crespo, said that they simply think the draft materials were unfairly biased against court-packing. He alleged that the discussion materials' framing "distorts" the debate because it does not seriously consider "the most salient and most viable intervention on the table" in court-packing.Â 
Crespo alleged that Republicans packed the Supreme Court "twice" in recent years with political hardball tactics, despite the fact the widely-accepted definition of court-packing is Congress adding justices to the court out of dissatisfaction with unfavorable rulings to the party in power. Duke Law School Professor David Levi responded to this point later in the discussion, saying that it is unfair to call leaving a seat open ahead of a presidential election â as Republicans did in 2016 â court packing. He noted that ahead of an election it is normal for a Senate of the opposite party of the president to decline to confirm nominees for lower courts, and that is not considered court-packing.Â 
Former U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, meanwhile, alleged that the Supreme Court is "enabling" Republicans to "secure a tactical advantage" in elections with state-level election laws.
The discussion materials presented a mixed view on court-packing, which ahead of the meeting drew backlash from some progressives who believe Biden and Democrats in Congress should pack the court with multiple liberal justices after Republicans confirmed three justices during former President Donald Trump's tenure.Â 
Co-Chairman Bob Bauer, who a former White House Counsel under former President Barack Obama, opened the Friday meeting by pushing back on the 
criticism of the discussion materials.

PROGRESSIVES FUME AS BIDEN SUPREME COURT COMMISSION SEEMS TO REJECT COURT-PACKING
"The commission has not edited the material and the material should not be understood to represent the commission's views or those of any particular commissioner," Bauer said. "To this point and particularly in light of some confusion and uncertainty since the posting of these materials, we refer you to the front page of each of the drafts that have been publicly posted that clearly set forth these points."
Bauer added that the materials are "not the commission's drafts nor a draft report of the commission."
The meeting opened at 10 a.m. with discussion of the reason many are calling for court reform. Most of the substantive discussion on court-packing happened from 11:10 a.m. and 12:50 p.m. as the commissioners deliberated "Membership and Size of the Court," according to the public agenda of the meeting.Â 
"It turns out that a vocal minority of commissioners arenât willing to let court-packing go," Cato Institute Vice President Ilya Shapiro told Fox News in response to the discussion. "Larry Tribe evocatively called it a âbreak the glassâ moment, where we effectively need to break norms to remedy alleged broken norms. The final report will thus likely reflect less of an anti-court-packing lean."
Shapiro added: "Adam Whiteâs description of a âhecklerâs veto theory of legitimacyâ is evocative: so much of the current call for reform is driven by upset (and even outrage) over the direction of political and legal developments."

Later in the day the commission will also debate potential reforms related to term limits for justices, potential rotation of justices, case selection and the Supreme Court's broader role within the Untied States' system of government.Â

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) â 
The Biden administration said Friday it will turn next to the U.S. Supreme Court in another attempt to halt a 
Texas
 law that has banned most 
abortions
 since September.Â 
It comes as the Texas clinics are running out of avenues to stop the GOP-engineered law that bans abortions once cardiac activity is detected, which is usually around six weeks. It amounts to the nation's biggest curb to abortion in nearly 50 years.
The latest defeat for clinics came Thursday night when a federal appeals panel in New Orleans, in a 2-1 decision, allowed the restrictions to remain in place for a third time in the last several weeks alone.Â 
Justice Department
 spokesman Anthony Coley said the federal government will now ask the Supreme Court to reverse that decision but did not say how quickly.
5TH CIRCUIT COURT GRANTS A STAY, ALLOWS TEXAS ABORTION BILL TO GO INTO EFFECT
The Biden administration was under pressure from abortion rights supporters to go to the Supreme Court even before the announcement. The court already once allowed the restrictions to take effect, but did so without ruling on the law's constitutionality.Â

Since the law took effect Sept. 1, Texas women have sought out abortion clinics in neighboring states, some driving hours through the middle of the night and including patients as young as 12 years old. The law makes no exception for cases of rape or incest.
The Texas Attorney General's Office called the decision Thursday night by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals a "testament that we are on the right side of the law and life."Â 
A 1992 decision by the Supreme Court prevented states from banning abortion before viability, the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb, around 24 weeks of pregnancy. But Texas' version has outmaneuvered courts so far due to the fact that it offloads enforcement to private citizens. Anyone who brings a successful lawsuit against an abortion provider for violating the law is entitled to claim at least $10,000 in damages, which the Biden administration says amounts to a bounty.
Only once has a court moved to put the restrictions on hold â and that order only stood for 48 hours.
SEN. JOSH HAWLEY TELLS RELIGIOUS CONSERVATIVES NATION NEEDS A âBAPTISM OF COURAGEâ
During that brief window, some Texas clinics rushed to perform abortions on patients past six weeks, but many more appointments were canceled after the 5th Circuit moved to swiftly reinstate the law last week.
Texas had roughly two dozen abortion clinics before the law took effect, and operators have said some may be forced to close if the restrictions stay in place for much longer.
Already the stakes are high in the coming months over the future of abortion rights in the U.S. In December, the new conservative majority on the Supreme Court will hear Mississippi's bid to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that guarantees a woman's right to an abortion.
Texas Right to Life, the state's largest anti-abortion group, set up a tip line to receive allegations against abortion providers but has not filed any lawsuits. Kimberlyn Schwartz, a spokeswoman, said Thursday the group expected the Biden administration to go to the Supreme Court next and was "confident Texas will ultimately defeat these attacks on our life-saving efforts."

On Wednesday, 18 state attorneys generals from mostly GOP-controlled states threw new support behind the Texas law, urging the court to let the restrictions stand while accusing the federal government of overstepping in bringing the challenge in the first place. Last month, more than 20 other states, mostly run by Democrats, had urged the lower court to throw out the law.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has called the law "clearly unconstitutional" and warned that it could become a model elsewhere in the country unless it's struck down.

After bipartisan backlash against White House Chief of Staff Ronald Klainâs inflation tweet, Fox News contributor Karl Rove told âAmerica Reportsâ on Friday that a chief of staff does not have any business tweeting considering the responsibilities of the job.
Bryan Llenas reports from Hartford, Conn. with the details.
Todayâs Democratic Party under the leadership of President Biden is the new unholy trinity of politics: irresponsible, arrogant, and tone deaf. White House Chief of Staff Ron Klainâs promotion of a tweet describing our nationâs ongoing inflation and supply chain crises as "high class problems" is no exception.
President Biden's Supreme Court commission will discuss a variety of reform proposals at its Friday meeting, as it seeks to shape a report due later this year.
President Joe Bidenâs Chief of Staff, Ron Klain, stepped on a landmine when he endorsed a Harvard economistâs tweet which suggested the rising cost of goods across the country is a "high class problem."
The 'Outnumbered' panel reacts to Secretary Mayorkas honoring National Police Week
The president's leadership picks draw sharp criticism amid rising crises.   
The Department of Homeland Security says it is ready to reinstate the Trump-era "Remain in Mexico" policy by mid-November in response to a court order upheld by the Supreme Court â even as it works to abolish the program by a different method.
'MediaBuzz' host Howie Kurtz reacts to Biden continually ignoring reporters' questions
First lady Jill Biden heads out on the campaign trail Friday in support of the Democratic nominees in the only two states in the nation to hold gubernatorial elections this November, including Terry McAuliffe in Virginia.

First lady
 Jill Biden heads out on the campaign trail on Friday in support of the 
Democratic nominees
 in the only two states in the nation to hold 
gubernatorial elections
 this November.
The first lady teams up Friday afternoon with 
New Jersey
 Gov. Phil Murphy at an early voting rally at Middlesex College in Edison. Later in the day sheâll join former 
Virginia
 Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a campaign event in the suburbs outside of Richmond, the stateâs capital city.Â 
While Murphy enjoys a double-digit lead over Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli in the reliably blue Garden State, McAuliffe is facing a much stiffer challenge against Republican nominee Glenn Youngkin in the commonwealth, a one-time premier battleground state thatâs trended toward the Democrats the past decade but remains competitive.
WHAT A BRAND NEW FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL SHOWDOWN
McAuliffe, whoâs running for his old job, holds a 51%-46% advantage over Youngkin among likely Virginia voters in a Fox News poll conducted Sunday through Wednesday and released Thursday. And an average of all of the latest surveys in the race indicate a razor-thin, lower-single-digit edge for McAuliffe in a state where the GOP hasnât won a statewide election in a dozen years.
The latest surveys in the state also indicate that Republican voters are more motivated than their Democratic counterparts. And McAuliffe's invited top surrogates to Virginia as he puts on a full-court press to get Democrats to cast ballots in the current early voting period or to go to the polls on Election Day.
Enter the first lady.
"She brings an experienced voice on issues that resonate with a lot of voters," former longtime Democratic National Committee member from New Hampshire Kathy Sullivan told Fox News. "Sheâs a very good surrogate with respect to generating the votes of suburban women. She speaks to their values, she speaks to their family issues, education issues, that are all very important to suburban female voters."
Sullivan also pointed out the "the first lady is also very well known for her work with military families, and you find a lot of military families in Virginia."
While Jill Biden, a longtime community college professor, has traveled across the country in support of her education initiatives, reopening schools amid the coronavirus pandemic, and urging Americans to get the COVID vaccine, this is the first ladyâs first foray on the campaign trail since last year.
JILL BIDEN STIFF-ARMS PROTESTER WHO RUSHED HER HUSBAND
But Jill Bidenâs no stranger to campaign politics. While then-first lady Melania Trump remained mostly absent from the campaign trail during the 2020 presidential general election, Jill Biden was a regular at rallies and other events on behalf of her husband. And she captured headlines and won praise for stiff-arming a protester who rushed at then-former Vice President Biden at a campaign event in March of last year during the Democratic presidential primaries.

First ladies have become more frequent visitors to the campaign trail in recent decades. Laura Bush and Michelle Obama â who at times enjoyed higher favorability ratings than their husbands â often stumped for candidates of their political parties during their tenures as first ladies.
"Just as the role women have changed, so to the role of the first lady has changed, and thatâs a good thing," Sullivan noted.
PRESIDENT BIDEN, DESPITE FLAGGING POLL NUMBERS, HEADING TO VIRGINIA CAMPAIGN TRAIL
Jill Bidenâs Friday campaign swing in New Jersey and Virginia comes as 
President Biden
âs approval ratings have taken a big hit since the beginning of August. The drop in the presidentâs numbers was fueled by criticism of his handling of the turbulent 
U.S. exit from Afghanistan
, the surge in 
COVID-19
 cases this summer mainly among unvaccinated people due to the spread of the highly infectious delta variant, and the latest surge of migrants trying to cross into the U.S. along 
the southern border
 with Mexico.
The presidentâs approval ratings in Virginia have also deteriorated. The new Fox News poll indicated Virginians divided on the job he is doing as president and on his favorability in a state he won by 10 points in last Novemberâs presidential election.Â 
McAuliffe, in a recent video conference clip that Republicans spotlighted, acknowledged that "we are facing a lot of headwinds from Washington, as you know. The president is unpopular today, unfortunately here in Virginia, so we have got to plow through."
But during an education roundtable in Alexandria, Virginia, on Tuesday, McAuliffe told reporters that the president will return to the commonwealth, telling reporters, "He'll be coming back. You bet he will."
The president last teamed up with McAuliffe on the campaign trail in late July in the voter-rich and heavily Democratic Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.Â 
McAuliffe announced earlier this week that former 
President Obama
 Â will campaign with the former governor in Richmond a week from Saturday, on Oct. 23. Even after nearly five years removed from the White House, the former two-term president remains very popular and influential with voters in his own party.Â

And McAuliffe will team up on the campaign trail this weekend with voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams, theÂ former Georgia House Democratic leader who in 2018 made history as the first Black female gubernatorial nominee of a major political party.
"Weâre at a point in the election where this is about getting your people out to vote," veteran Democratic strategist Josh Schwerin, who ran communications for McAuliffeâs successful 2013 gubernatorial campaign, told Fox News.

Some members of 
President Biden's
 
Supreme Court
 commission Friday railed against the framing of wide-ranging discussion materials it released Thursday night on 
court-packing
, alleging that it focused too much on partisan politics rather than institutional confidence, as others alleged it's "biased" against court-packing.
"This entire discussion is framed in the context of partisan politics. And I actually think that is a disservice to the exploration of this issue," NAACP Legal Defense Fund President Sherrilyn Ifill said about the chapter on court-packing. She said that many of those who favor court-packing have "genuine concerns" about rule of law and other issues.Â 
"There are many reasons why one might support the idea of expanding the court that don't have to do with your being beholden to a particular partisan agenda," she added. "You've basically allowed people to check out from the arguments that actually relate to the legitimacy of the Supreme Court."
"Although my guess that Commissioner Ifill and I probably disagree on the merits of court expansion, I couldn't agree more with her comment about the way the issue is framed," replied former D.C. Circuit Judge Thomas Griffith, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush and opposes court-packing.

BOSTON BOMBER: BARRETT ASKS DOJ LAWYER WHY BIDEN ADMIN WANTS TO REINSTATE DEATH SENTENCE AMID EXECUTION PAUSE
"It's framed in this partisan way of looking at this as Democrats vs. Republicans ... too much of this discussion draft reinforces the assumptions of many that the justices are partisans just looking for ways to advance the policy agendas of the president who appointed them," he continued. "It's inaccurateâ¦ The Supreme Court has played well its vital role. It has repeatedly demonstrated a commitment to the rule of lawâ¦ This is the time to build confidence in this report. Too frequently elements of this draft report do just the opposite."
Other liberal commissioners, including Harvard Law Professor Andrew Crespo, said that they simply think the draft materials were unfairly biased against court-packing. He alleged that the discussion materials' framing "distorts" the debate because it does not seriously consider "the most salient and most viable intervention on the table" in court-packing.Â 
Crespo alleged that Republicans packed the Supreme Court "twice" in recent years with political hardball tactics, despite the fact the widely-accepted definition of court-packing is Congress adding justices to the court out of dissatisfaction with unfavorable rulings to the party in power. Duke Law School Professor David Levi responded to this point later in the discussion, saying that it is unfair to call leaving a seat open ahead of a presidential election â as Republicans did in 2016 â court packing. He noted that ahead of an election it is normal for a Senate of the opposite party of the president to decline to confirm nominees for lower courts, and that is not considered court-packing.Â 
Former U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, meanwhile, alleged that the Supreme Court is "enabling" Republicans to "secure a tactical advantage" in elections with state-level election laws.
The discussion materials presented a mixed view on court-packing, which ahead of the meeting drew backlash from some progressives who believe Biden and Democrats in Congress should pack the court with multiple liberal justices after Republicans confirmed three justices during former President Donald Trump's tenure.Â 
Co-Chairman Bob Bauer, who a former White House Counsel under former President Barack Obama, opened the Friday meeting by pushing back on the 
criticism of the discussion materials.

Scott Applewhite)
      
PROGRESSIVES FUME AS BIDEN SUPREME COURT COMMISSION SEEMS TO REJECT COURT-PACKING
"The commission has not edited the material and the material should not be understood to represent the commission's views or those of any particular commissioner," Bauer said. "To this point and particularly in light of some confusion and uncertainty since the posting of these materials, we refer you to the front page of each of the drafts that have been publicly posted that clearly set forth these points."
Bauer added that the materials are "not the commission's drafts nor a draft report of the commission."
The meeting opened at 10 a.m. with discussion of the reason many are calling for court reform. Most of the substantive discussion on court-packing happened from 11:10 a.m. and 12:50 p.m. as the commissioners deliberated "Membership and Size of the Court," according to the public agenda of the meeting.Â 
"It turns out that a vocal minority of commissioners arenât willing to let court-packing go," Cato Institute Vice President Ilya Shapiro told Fox News in response to the discussion. "Larry Tribe evocatively called it a âbreak the glassâ moment, where we effectively need to break norms to remedy alleged broken norms. The final report will thus likely reflect less of an anti-court-packing lean."
Shapiro added: "Adam Whiteâs description of a âhecklerâs veto theory of legitimacyâ is evocative: so much of the current call for reform is driven by upset (and even outrage) over the direction of political and legal developments."

Later in the day the commission will also debate potential reforms related to term limits for justices, potential rotation of justices, case selection and the Supreme Court's broader role within the Untied States' system of government.Â

First lady
 Jill Biden heads out on the campaign trail on Friday in support of the 
Democratic nominees
 in the only two states in the nation to hold 
gubernatorial elections
 this November.
The first lady teams up Friday afternoon with 
New Jersey
 Gov. Phil Murphy at an early voting rally at Middlesex College in Edison. Later in the day sheâll join former 
Virginia
 Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a campaign event in the suburbs outside of Richmond, the stateâs capital city.Â 
While Murphy enjoys a double-digit lead over Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli in the reliably blue Garden State, McAuliffe is facing a much stiffer challenge against Republican nominee Glenn Youngkin in the commonwealth, a one-time premier battleground state thatâs trended toward the Democrats the past decade but remains competitive.
WHAT A BRAND NEW FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE VIRGINIA GUBERNATORIAL SHOWDOWN
McAuliffe, whoâs running for his old job, holds a 51%-46% advantage over Youngkin among likely Virginia voters in a Fox News poll conducted Sunday through Wednesday and released Thursday. And an average of all of the latest surveys in the race indicate a razor-thin, lower-single-digit edge for McAuliffe in a state where the GOP hasnât won a statewide election in a dozen years.
The latest surveys in the state also indicate that Republican voters are more motivated than their Democratic counterparts. And McAuliffe's invited top surrogates to Virginia as he puts on a full-court press to get Democrats to cast ballots in the current early voting period or to go to the polls on Election Day.
Enter the first lady.
"She brings an experienced voice on issues that resonate with a lot of voters," former longtime Democratic National Committee member from New Hampshire Kathy Sullivan told Fox News. "Sheâs a very good surrogate with respect to generating the votes of suburban women. She speaks to their values, she speaks to their family issues, education issues, that are all very important to suburban female voters."
Sullivan also pointed out the "the first lady is also very well known for her work with military families, and you find a lot of military families in Virginia."
While Jill Biden, a longtime community college professor, has traveled across the country in support of her education initiatives, reopening schools amid the coronavirus pandemic, and urging Americans to get the COVID vaccine, this is the first ladyâs first foray on the campaign trail since last year.
JILL BIDEN STIFF-ARMS PROTESTER WHO RUSHED HER HUSBAND
But Jill Bidenâs no stranger to campaign politics. While then-first lady Melania Trump remained mostly absent from the campaign trail during the 2020 presidential general election, Jill Biden was a regular at rallies and other events on behalf of her husband. And she captured headlines and won praise for stiff-arming a protester who rushed at then-former Vice President Biden at a campaign event in March of last year during the Democratic presidential primaries.

President Biden's Supreme Court commission will discuss a variety of reform proposals at its Friday meeting, as it seeks to shape a report due later this year.
The Biden administration said Friday it will turn next to the U.S. Supreme Court in another attempt to halt a Texas law that has banned most abortions since September.Â 
The Department of Homeland Security says it is ready to reinstate the Trump-era "Remain in Mexico" policy by mid-November in response to a court order upheld by the Supreme Court â even as it works to abolish the program by a different method.
Progressives panned President Biden's Supreme Court commission over discussion materials it released Thursday, which they said did not advocate strongly enough for court-packing.
Texas can continue banning most abortions after a federal appeals court rejected the Biden administrationâs latest attempt to stop a novel law that has become the nationâs biggest curb to abortion in nearly 50 years.
Thirty years have passed since Clarence Thomas' confirmation to the Supreme Court, and he has amassed a record as the courtâs staunchest defender of constitutional originalism.
This week marks the 30th anniversary of Clarence Thomas' confirmation to sit on the Supreme Court, and with it more than a generation of vitriolic attacks against the justice.
Congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest from Capitol Hill on 'Special Report'
The Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court released its first report Thursday, suggesting that an expansion of the court would be unlikely to achieve balance.
The National Rifle Association is getting set to argue would could be a landmark Second Amendment case in front of the Supreme Court

President Biden's Supreme Court commission will discuss a variety of reform proposals at its Friday meeting, as it seeks to shape a report due later this year.
The Biden administration said Friday it will turn next to the U.S. Supreme Court in another attempt to halt a Texas law that has banned most abortions since September.Â 
The Department of Homeland Security says it is ready to reinstate the Trump-era "Remain in Mexico" policy by mid-November in response to a court order upheld by the Supreme Court â even as it works to abolish the program by a different method.
Progressives panned President Biden's Supreme Court commission over discussion materials it released Thursday, which they said did not advocate strongly enough for court-packing.
Texas can continue banning most abortions after a federal appeals court rejected the Biden administrationâs latest attempt to stop a novel law that has become the nationâs biggest curb to abortion in nearly 50 years.
Thirty years have passed since Clarence Thomas' confirmation to the Supreme Court, and he has amassed a record as the courtâs staunchest defender of constitutional originalism.

'Fox & Friends' hosts discuss the former president's comments on the state of immigration in the U.S.
Former President 
Obama
 will attend the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, next month to highlight the "important progress" made with climate change since the Paris Agreement took effect, while 
President Biden
 and his Cabinet officials plan to double down on the administration's commitment to combating climate change.Â 
Obama spokeswomanÂ Hannah HankinsÂ on Friday said Obama will travel to Glasgow for the COP26 conference, where he plans to "meet with young activists engaged in the climate fight and deliver remarks putting the threat of climate change in broader context."Â 
"He will lay out the important progress made in the five years since the Paris Agreement took effect, highlight the leadership of young people around the globe, and urge more robust action going forward by all of us - governments, the private sector, philanthropy, and civil society," she added.Â 
The White House announced Thursday that Biden would participate in the World Leader Summit in Glasgow on Nov. 1 and 2 at the beginning of the 26th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.Â 
Biden is expected to attend with a number of Cabinet officials and senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Transportation Secretary 
Pete Buttigieg
, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Biden climate adviser Gina McCarthy and Climate Envoy John Kerry.Â 
Biden last year announced Kerry would serve as the special presidential envoy for climateÂ and would sit on the National Security Council â marking it the first administration with the NSC including an official dedicated to climate change.
It is unclear whether Obama will participate in any meetings or events with Biden and his Cabinet officials. Earlier this year, the 
White House
 said Biden and Obama spoke "regularly" about a "range of issues" as well as personal matters but did not disclose the frequency of those conversations.
Biden and members of his administration have declared climate change a national security threat. Over the summer, Biden warned it would be the "greatest threat" to Americaâs national security in the coming years.

The U.S. formally rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement in February following Bidenâs day-one executive order. The order reversed a Trump-era decision to withdraw from the accord. The Paris Agreement is a global pact created during the Obama administration to combat climate change.Â 
Biden's participation in the summit will come after he meets with 
Pope Francis
 on Oct. 29 in Vatican City and participates in the G20 Leaders' Summit on Oct. 30 and 31 in Rome. The White House said additional details about "individual bilateral engagements on the margins of G20 will be forthcoming."Â

Some members of 
President Biden's
 
Supreme Court
 commission Friday railed against the framing of wide-ranging discussion materials it released Thursday night on 
court-packing
, alleging that it focused too much on partisan politics rather than institutional confidence, as others alleged it's "biased" against court-packing.
"This entire discussion is framed in the context of partisan politics. And I actually think that is a disservice to the exploration of this issue," NAACP Legal Defense Fund President Sherrilyn Ifill said about the chapter on court-packing. She said that many of those who favor court-packing have "genuine concerns" about rule of law and other issues.Â 
"There are many reasons why one might support the idea of expanding the court that don't have to do with your being beholden to a particular partisan agenda," she added. "You've basically allowed people to check out from the arguments that actually relate to the legitimacy of the Supreme Court."
"Although my guess that Commissioner Ifill and I probably disagree on the merits of court expansion, I couldn't agree more with her comment about the way the issue is framed," replied former D.C. Circuit Judge Thomas Griffith, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush and opposes court-packing.

BOSTON BOMBER: BARRETT ASKS DOJ LAWYER WHY BIDEN ADMIN WANTS TO REINSTATE DEATH SENTENCE AMID EXECUTION PAUSE
"It's framed in this partisan way of looking at this as Democrats vs. Republicans ... too much of this discussion draft reinforces the assumptions of many that the justices are partisans just looking for ways to advance the policy agendas of the president who appointed them," he continued. "It's inaccurateâ¦ The Supreme Court has played well its vital role. It has repeatedly demonstrated a commitment to the rule of lawâ¦ This is the time to build confidence in this report. Too frequently elements of this draft report do just the opposite."
Other liberal commissioners, including Harvard Law Professor Andrew Crespo, said that they simply think the draft materials were unfairly biased against court-packing. He alleged that the discussion materials' framing "distorts" the debate because it does not seriously consider "the most salient and most viable intervention on the table" in court-packing.Â 
Crespo alleged that Republicans packed the Supreme Court "twice" in recent years with political hardball tactics, despite the fact the widely-accepted definition of court-packing is Congress adding justices to the court out of dissatisfaction with unfavorable rulings to the party in power. Duke Law School Professor David Levi responded to this point later in the discussion, saying that it is unfair to call leaving a seat open ahead of a presidential election â as Republicans did in 2016 â court packing. He noted that ahead of an election it is normal for a Senate of the opposite party of the president to decline to confirm nominees for lower courts, and that is not considered court-packing.Â 
Former U.S. District Judge Nancy Gertner, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, meanwhile, alleged that the Supreme Court is "enabling" Republicans to "secure a tactical advantage" in elections with state-level election laws.
The discussion materials presented a mixed view on court-packing, which ahead of the meeting drew backlash from some progressives who believe Biden and Democrats in Congress should pack the court with multiple liberal justices after Republicans confirmed three justices during former President Donald Trump's tenure.Â 
Co-Chairman Bob Bauer, who a former White House Counsel under former President Barack Obama, opened the Friday meeting by pushing back on the 
criticism of the discussion materials.

PROGRESSIVES FUME AS BIDEN SUPREME COURT COMMISSION SEEMS TO REJECT COURT-PACKING
"The commission has not edited the material and the material should not be understood to represent the commission's views or those of any particular commissioner," Bauer said. "To this point and particularly in light of some confusion and uncertainty since the posting of these materials, we refer you to the front page of each of the drafts that have been publicly posted that clearly set forth these points."
Bauer added that the materials are "not the commission's drafts nor a draft report of the commission."
The meeting opened at 10 a.m. with discussion of the reason many are calling for court reform. Most of the substantive discussion on court-packing happened from 11:10 a.m. and 12:50 p.m. as the commissioners deliberated "Membership and Size of the Court," according to the public agenda of the meeting.Â 
"It turns out that a vocal minority of commissioners arenât willing to let court-packing go," Cato Institute Vice President Ilya Shapiro told Fox News in response to the discussion. "Larry Tribe evocatively called it a âbreak the glassâ moment, where we effectively need to break norms to remedy alleged broken norms. The final report will thus likely reflect less of an anti-court-packing lean."
Shapiro added: "Adam Whiteâs description of a âhecklerâs veto theory of legitimacyâ is evocative: so much of the current call for reform is driven by upset (and even outrage) over the direction of political and legal developments."

Later in the day the commission will also debate potential reforms related to term limits for justices, potential rotation of justices, case selection and the Supreme Court's broader role within the Untied States' system of government.Â

Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said 
President Biden
's foreign policy "fails to understand" the "harsh reality" of good versus evil, warning, in an interview with Fox News, that without considering the "ramifications" of his administration's actions around the globe, "America will be diminished."Â 
Fox News spoke with the former secretary of state before he and former Trump national security adviser Robert O'Brien received the Richard Nixon Foundation's 2021 Architect of Peace Award for their work in developing and implementing the 2020 Abraham Accords and the 2020 Serbia-Kosovo economic normalization agreements. They were also honored for their oversight of the repatriation of more than 50 American hostages detained abroad.Â 
HOUSE REPUBLICAN WARNS BAGRAM PRISONERS RELEASED BY TALIBAN COULD TRY US ENTRY VIA 'POROUS' SOUTHERN BORDER
Speaking broadly about the shift in foreign policy from the Trump administration to the Biden administration, Pompeo told Fox News that international partners and allies are growing increasingly concerned about America's role in the world.Â 
"I think the world is very worried," Pompeo said. "I think they see the first nine months, and they are very concerned that America is leaving the international stage."Â 
Pompeo reflected on a number of foreign policy actions taken under Biden's leadership â including the full withdrawal of U.S. military assets from Afghanistan, which led to the Taliban takeover of the country, and the negotiations for a potential reentry into the JCPOA Iran Nuclear Deal.Â 
"At its very core, what the Biden administration fails to understand is there is a harsh reality out there, that there is evil and there is good," Pompeo said. "And if you withdraw from Afghanistan without considering the ramifications and dealing with them and making sure the conditions are right, America will be diminished."Â

"If you don't make clear that you're going to be an unbreakable ally of the state of Israel, then the Iranians will provide rockets to Hamas in the Gaza Strip and they will fire them into the state of Israel," he continued. "And if you don't understand that American energy is an incredibly powerful national security tool, and instead, you shut it down and give the Russians access to European markets, and beg the Middle East to build more production capacity, you put America at risk."
He added: "Those are just indisputable facts. That is the reality of the world that we live in, and the Trump administration was serious about using American power as a force for good in the world against the backdrop of reality."Â 
With regard to the administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, Pompeo said the "singular greatest mistake" in the mission was "the one that was made by the commander in chief himself."Â 
"To set an arbitrary, unconditional deadline," Pompeo explained, referring to Biden's public commitment to withdraw all assets by Aug. 31. "And once that's done, once you set the date certain, then the bad guys know that they can push you--and that's what they did."Â 
Pompeo said the Taliban also "pushed us."Â 
"But when the Taliban pushed us, we crushed them," Pompeo said. "When you set a date certain, and they push on you and you withdraw, inch by inch, yard by yard, this didn't just happen in 11 days-- that's the myth the Biden administration tells. This wasn't 11 days, this was weeks and weeks and weeks of the Taliban advancing on provincial capitals all across the country."Â 
Pompeo went on to describe it as "a failure of America to respond, to make clear that that's unacceptable, and then the ultimate collapse of the Afghan government, as we, for some reason, oddly, closed Bagram, pulled out most of our military forces while we still had, or still have dozens if not hundreds of Americans behind, what is today, enemy lines."Â 
Reflecting on his interactions with members of the Taliban during the Trump administration, Pompeo said they only "understood one thing."Â 
"Power. They understood American power," he said.Â 
The Trump administration initially set conditions with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan in May 2021 â a date Biden extended â but under the conditions that no U.S. military assets or service members were harmed.Â 
"The arrangement was only as good as your willingness to enforce it, and to watch them, and to call them on it, and to demand, and when they don't comply, to impose real costs on them," Pompeo said.Â 
BLINKEN DODGES ON WHETHER BIDEN ADMIN HAS MISMANAGED FOREIGN POLICY CRISES
"The world is looking for American leadership," he continued. "They are looking for a president who is prepared to take real action to defend the things they articulated as important."Â 
Citing actions under former 
President Trump
, Pompeo said "we were prepared to use, very judiciously, American military power and American economic power to deliver."Â 
"I pray that they restore American credibility," Pompeo said of the Biden administration. "I think they have an opportunity to do that."Â 
Pompeo was honored at the Nixon Foundation for his work during the the Trump administration.Â 
Pompeo was a key player in brokering the Abraham Accords, which the Trump administration called a "historic peace agreement" between Israel and the United Arab Emirates that normalized relations and created bilateral agreements regarding "investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications, technology, energy, health care, culture, the environment, the establishment of reciprocal embassies, and other areas of mutual benefit."
At the time, Israel and the UAE also said they would continue their efforts to "achieve a just, comprehensive and enduring resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
Pompeo also helped broker the agreement between Serbia and Kosovo, which normalized economic relations between the two countries. It also included Kosovo recognizingÂ Israel, andÂ Serbia agreeing to moveÂ its embassy to Jerusalem.
"It is incredibly humbling to receive this award, two presidents had it, Dr. Kissinger, Annenberg," he said. "It is an illustrious group of people, and so to be considered amongst those, for me, is really quite something."

As for his future plans, there has been speculation of potential White House ambitions.Â 
On that topic, Pompeo told Fox News he has "been at the fight for our republic, to protect liberty and freedom here in the United States for an awful long time."Â 
"There is no reason to think that I will do anything but stay in that effort, to promote conservative ideas for the next 20 or 30 years," Pompeo said.Â 
He added: "What role that will be in? Only the Lord knows."Â

Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said 
President Biden
's foreign policy "fails to understand" the "harsh reality" of good versus evil, warning, in an interview with Fox News, that without considering the "ramifications" of his administration's actions around the globe, "America will be diminished."Â 
Fox News spoke with the former secretary of state before he and former Trump national security adviser Robert O'Brien received the Richard Nixon Foundation's 2021 Architect of Peace Award for their work in developing and implementing the 2020 Abraham Accords and the 2020 Serbia-Kosovo economic normalization agreements. They were also honored for their oversight of the repatriation of more than 50 American hostages detained abroad.Â 
HOUSE REPUBLICAN WARNS BAGRAM PRISONERS RELEASED BY TALIBAN COULD TRY US ENTRY VIA 'POROUS' SOUTHERN BORDER
Speaking broadly about the shift in foreign policy from the Trump administration to the Biden administration, Pompeo told Fox News that international partners and allies are growing increasingly concerned about America's role in the world.Â 
"I think the world is very worried," Pompeo said. "I think they see the first nine months, and they are very concerned that America is leaving the international stage."Â 
Pompeo reflected on a number of foreign policy actions taken under Biden's leadership â including the full withdrawal of U.S. military assets from Afghanistan, which led to the Taliban takeover of the country, and the negotiations for a potential reentry into the JCPOA Iran Nuclear Deal.Â 
"At its very core, what the Biden administration fails to understand is there is a harsh reality out there, that there is evil and there is good," Pompeo said. "And if you withdraw from Afghanistan without considering the ramifications and dealing with them and making sure the conditions are right, America will be diminished."Â

"If you don't make clear that you're going to be an unbreakable ally of the state of Israel, then the Iranians will provide rockets to Hamas in the Gaza Strip and they will fire them into the state of Israel," he continued. "And if you don't understand that American energy is an incredibly powerful national security tool, and instead, you shut it down and give the Russians access to European markets, and beg the Middle East to build more production capacity, you put America at risk."
He added: "Those are just indisputable facts. That is the reality of the world that we live in, and the Trump administration was serious about using American power as a force for good in the world against the backdrop of reality."Â 
With regard to the administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, Pompeo said the "singular greatest mistake" in the mission was "the one that was made by the commander in chief himself."Â 
"To set an arbitrary, unconditional deadline," Pompeo explained, referring to Biden's public commitment to withdraw all assets by Aug. 31. "And once that's done, once you set the date certain, then the bad guys know that they can push you--and that's what they did."Â 
Pompeo said the Taliban also "pushed us."Â 
"But when the Taliban pushed us, we crushed them," Pompeo said. "When you set a date certain, and they push on you and you withdraw, inch by inch, yard by yard, this didn't just happen in 11 days-- that's the myth the Biden administration tells. This wasn't 11 days, this was weeks and weeks and weeks of the Taliban advancing on provincial capitals all across the country."Â 
Pompeo went on to describe it as "a failure of America to respond, to make clear that that's unacceptable, and then the ultimate collapse of the Afghan government, as we, for some reason, oddly, closed Bagram, pulled out most of our military forces while we still had, or still have dozens if not hundreds of Americans behind, what is today, enemy lines."Â 
Reflecting on his interactions with members of the Taliban during the Trump administration, Pompeo said they only "understood one thing."Â 
"Power. They understood American power," he said.Â 
The Trump administration initially set conditions with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan in May 2021 â a date Biden extended â but under the conditions that no U.S. military assets or service members were harmed.Â 
"The arrangement was only as good as your willingness to enforce it, and to watch them, and to call them on it, and to demand, and when they don't comply, to impose real costs on them," Pompeo said.Â 
BLINKEN DODGES ON WHETHER BIDEN ADMIN HAS MISMANAGED FOREIGN POLICY CRISES
"The world is looking for American leadership," he continued. "They are looking for a president who is prepared to take real action to defend the things they articulated as important."Â 
Citing actions under former 
President Trump
, Pompeo said "we were prepared to use, very judiciously, American military power and American economic power to deliver."Â 
"I pray that they restore American credibility," Pompeo said of the Biden administration. "I think they have an opportunity to do that."Â 
Pompeo was honored at the Nixon Foundation for his work during the the Trump administration.Â 
Pompeo was a key player in brokering the Abraham Accords, which the Trump administration called a "historic peace agreement" between Israel and the United Arab Emirates that normalized relations and created bilateral agreements regarding "investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications, technology, energy, health care, culture, the environment, the establishment of reciprocal embassies, and other areas of mutual benefit."
At the time, Israel and the UAE also said they would continue their efforts to "achieve a just, comprehensive and enduring resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
Pompeo also helped broker the agreement between Serbia and Kosovo, which normalized economic relations between the two countries. It also included Kosovo recognizingÂ Israel, andÂ Serbia agreeing to moveÂ its embassy to Jerusalem.
"It is incredibly humbling to receive this award, two presidents had it, Dr. Kissinger, Annenberg," he said. "It is an illustrious group of people, and so to be considered amongst those, for me, is really quite something."

As for his future plans, there has been speculation of potential White House ambitions.Â 
On that topic, Pompeo told Fox News he has "been at the fight for our republic, to protect liberty and freedom here in the United States for an awful long time."Â 
"There is no reason to think that I will do anything but stay in that effort, to promote conservative ideas for the next 20 or 30 years," Pompeo said.Â 
He added: "What role that will be in? Only the Lord knows."Â

Scheller attorney: He took accountability and was punished for speaking the truth
The 
U.S. Marine
 who posted videos on social media criticizing 
military
 leadership and the Biden administrationâs withdrawal of military assets from 
Afghanistan
 was issued a letter of reprimand and a forfeiture of $5,000 worth of pay for one month, after pleading guilty to all charges during his court-martial hearing this week.Â 
Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller Jr. pled guilty to all sixÂ 
misdemeanor
-level charges Thursday, including willfully disobeying a superior commissioned officer, dereliction in the performance of duties and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.
The judge, on Friday, said he would have given a two-month forfeiture of pay, had it not been for the nine days Scheller spent in pre-trial confinement. Scheller was freed from the brig last week where he was being held for violating an agreement to stop posting criticism on social media.Â 
The judge said he does not condone Schellerâs offenses, but noted his 17 year USMC career, saying that prior to his social media incident, he was an officer with an outstanding record â a record, he said, he weighed heavily.Â 

      
      
(Fox News)
The letter of reprimand was much less than what was recommended. The prosecution recommended a forfeiture of $5,000 of pay for 6 months and a letter of reprimand. The maximum penalty could have been forfeiture of 2/3 monthly pay for 12 months and a letter of reprimand.
US NAVY SET TO BOOT SAILORS WHO REFUSE COVID VACCINE
The sentencing came after Scheller was relieved of his command at one of Camp Lejeuneâs infantry training battalions in August after posting the videos to Facebook and LinkedIn after a bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul took the lives of 13 U.S. service members as well as dozens of Afghan citizens.
"Did anyone raise their hand and say, âWe completely messed this up?'" Scheller had asked in a video. "Iâm not saying we can take back what has been done. All I asked for was accountability, for people to comment on what I said and to say, âYes. Mistakes were made.â And had they done that I would've gone back into rank and file, submitted, and accomplished what I wanted."
Scheller is a decorated Marine who has served for 17 years.Â

His other charges include contempt toward officers, disrespect towardÂ superior commissioned officers and failure to obey order or regulation.Â

Border Patrol
 agents said Tuesday they found two little sisters, ages 4 and 6, wandering alone just south of theÂ Morelos Dam at the U.S.-Mexico border.
The location is commonly used as a crossing point for unaccompanied migrant children, according to U.S. Border Patrol Yuma Sector. An agent working in the areaÂ spotted the sisters and escorted them to safety, according to the 
Facebook
 post.

 in the interview that children as young as 8 years old are being sold into prostitution.Â 
"Across the globe, more than 25 million people are subjected to human trafficking and slavery. In the United States, it's tens of thousands," she said. "When you think about the number of people coming across the border and flooding into our cities, those that we don't even know â¦ even those that have been apprehended. Women and children who are being released and Border Patrol agents â¦ I've reported on this in the past, have said we release them and we don't even know if these are their real families."Â

"Did anyone raise their hand and say, âWe completely messed this up?'" Scheller had asked in a video. "Iâm not saying we can take back what has been done. All I asked for was accountability, for people to comment on what I said and to say, âYes. Mistakes were made.â And had they done that I would've gone back into rank and file, submitted, and accomplished what I wanted."
Scheller is a decorated Marine who has served for 17 years.Â

Former Obama Economic Council Chair Jason Furman discusses his controversial tweet, which sparked a media firestorm when it was retweeted by White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain
California Democrats
 are distancing themselves from the 
Biden administration
 over recent supply chain and environmental crises in the greater Los Angeles area.
Fox News reached out to 24 Southern California House Democrats asking if the Biden administration has done enough to alleviate the supply chain bottleneck at the two Los Angeles ports and address other public safety crises, including a massive oil spill off the coast and a fire that broke out on shipping containers due to the vessel backlog.Â 
Not a single Democrat responded to Fox News regarding what needs to be done on the local and federal levels to immediately solve these crises in their own backyards.
FBI JOINS INVESTIGATION INTO ORANGE COUNTY OIL SPILL AS LA-AREA CRISES MOUNT
Instead, many of these Democrats are arguing for the end of offshore drilling, but ignoring the longer term impacts of the spill, which the Coast Guard estimates leaked between 25,000-132,000 gallons of crude oil into the ocean, and growing inflation caused by the goods bottleneck. Coast Guard Capt. Rebecca Ore said Thursday that the leak is likely closer to 24,000 gallons at 588 barrels.Â 
Rep. Julia Brownley, D-Calif., whose district covers Ventura County just north of L.A., 
tweeted 
that she is joining with her Democratic colleagues to support a federal ban on new oil leases off the California coast.Â 
Southern California Democratic Reps. Katie Porter, Alan Lowenthal and Mike Levin announced they will hold a joint congressional hearing in Irvine next week on the oil spill. Their release did not mention a discussion of the bottlenecked supply chain issues or the environmental hazard of a fire at the port.
President Biden announced earlier this week that the Port of Los Angeles will begin operating 24 hours a day to reduce the devastating backlog resulting in the supply chain bottleneck. His administration is under fire for rising inflation, which has skyrocketed over the past year.
Biden's Chief of Staff Ron Klain also received criticism for a recent tweet in which he referred to rising inflation as a "high class problem."
On the other hand, Southern California Republicans have been extremely vocal on the crises engulfing their own districts.Â 
Rep. Young Kim, R-Calif., thanked Biden for taking a step to address the supply chain issue, but reiterated that southern California communities are "reeling" from the series of ongoing crises.

      Container ships at the Los Angeles Port.
      
"Our Southern California communities are reeling from the impacts of backlogged ships at our LA and Long Beach ports, from supply chain shortages driving up inflation to the recent oil spill that may have been caused by a ship anchor," said Kim.
Kim's office said that the congresswoman has been working since January to safely keep the ports open and "boost the flow of goods in and out of the San Pedro Port Complex."

Another Southern California Republican, Rep. Michelle Steel, urged the Biden administration to approve a Major Disaster Declaration she requested over a week ago.
"I am glad the Administration is finally acting on this issue and now itâs time to approve the Major Disaster Declaration I asked for more than a week ago. The backlog in our ports has caused ships to idle off our coastline for weeks, which may have contributed to the oil spill that devastated our community. I urge the President to approve this request and applaud these efforts to get these ships moving quickly and out of our coastal waters," said Steel.

Another Southern California Republican, Rep. Michelle Steel, urged the Biden administration to approve a Major Disaster Declaration she requested over a week ago.
"I am glad the Administration is finally acting on this issue and now itâs time to approve the Major Disaster Declaration I asked for more than a week ago.

I urge the President to approve this request and applaud these efforts to get these ships moving quickly and out of our coastal waters," said Steel.

Border Patrol
 agents said Tuesday they found two little sisters, ages 4 and 6, wandering alone just south of theÂ Morelos Dam at the U.S.-Mexico border.
The location is commonly used as a crossing point for unaccompanied migrant children, according to U.S. Border Patrol Yuma Sector. An agent working in the areaÂ spotted the sisters and escorted them to safety, according to the 
Facebook
 post.

The girls were carrying a note with contact information for their "tia" and were taken into custody.

"Across the globe, more than 25 million people are subjected to human trafficking and slavery. In the United States, it's tens of thousands," she said. "When you think about the number of people coming across the border and flooding into our cities, those that we don't even know â¦ even those that have been apprehended. Women and children who are being released and Border Patrol agents â¦ I've reported on this in the past, have said we release them and we don't even know if these are their real families."Â

Former Obama Economic Council Chair Jason Furman discusses his controversial tweet, which sparked a media firestorm when it was retweeted by White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain
California Democrats
 are distancing themselves from the 
Biden administration
 over recent supply chain and environmental crises in the greater Los Angeles area.
Fox News reached out to 24 Southern California House Democrats asking if the Biden administration has done enough to alleviate the supply chain bottleneck at the two Los Angeles ports and address other public safety crises, including a massive oil spill off the coast and a fire that broke out on shipping containers due to the vessel backlog.Â 
Not a single Democrat responded to Fox News regarding what needs to be done on the local and federal levels to immediately solve these crises in their own backyards.

Instead, many of these Democrats are arguing for the end of offshore drilling, but ignoring the longer term impacts of the spill, which the Coast Guard estimates leaked between 25,000-132,000 gallons of crude oil into the ocean, and growing inflation caused by the goods bottleneck. Coast Guard Capt. Rebecca Ore said Thursday that the leak is likely closer to 24,000 gallons at 588 barrels.Â 
Rep. Julia Brownley, D-Calif., whose district covers Ventura County just north of L.A., 
tweeted 
that she is joining with her Democratic colleagues to support a federal ban on new oil leases off the California coast.Â 
Southern California Democratic Reps. Katie Porter, Alan Lowenthal and Mike Levin announced they will hold a joint congressional hearing in Irvine next week on the oil spill.

The Presidential Commission on the 
Supreme Court
 released its first report Thursday, suggesting that an expansion of the court would be unlikely to achieve balance and instead recommending the rotation of justices.
"There are also reasons to doubt that Court expansion necessarily would produce benefits in terms of diversity of efficiency," 
the Commission said
 in the report. "There is no guarantee that a larger Court would be drawn from a more diverse group of individuals. And a larger court may be 
less 
efficient than the current complement of justices."
The report comes after some congressional Democrats earlier this year 
called for an expansion
 to the Supreme Court, arguing that Republicans had unfairly obtained a conservative majority after former President Donald Trump was able to fill three vacancies during his single term.
NRA PREPS ARGUMENTS FOR POTENTIAL LANDMARK NOV. 3 SECOND AMENDMENT SCOTUS CASE
President Biden
, who in the past had expressed opposition to the idea of expanding the court, responded to the calls by 
forming the commission
 to study court expansion and reform.
But the commission pointed to other risks to expanding the court, including recent polling that indicates the public does not favor court expansion, while noting that expanding the court could lead to a "continuous cycle of future expansions."
"To be sure, any Supreme Court Reform would likely require unified government," the report says. "Nevertheless, we believe it is important to recognize the risk. According to one [purportedly modest] estimate of the consequences of expansion as parties gain Senate majorities and add Justices, the Supreme Court could expand to twenty-three or twenty-nine Justices in the next fifty years, and thirty-nine or possibly sixty-three Justices over the next century."
One idea floated by the commission as an alternative to expansion is a rotation system, which would see judges rotate between service on the Supreme Court and in lower federal courts.Â 
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
But the report also notes that such a reform could face a "constitutional obstacle," noting that Article III, Section 1, of the Constitution states that "the judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in 
one supreme Court
, and in such interior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish."
The report adds that there are also potential drawbacks to a rotation system even if they were deemed legal, including that such a system could "introduce inefficiencies into the court's work."

'Hannity' host Sean Hannity says Klain is the 'puppeteer' pulling Biden's proverbial strings
If thereâs one person who knows 
about "high-class problems," itâs Ron Klain
.Â 
The White House chief of staff, 59, has been a fixture among the political elite for nearly four decades â and made out quite well as a result.Â 
A financial disclosure report released by the White House in March showed Klain had assets valued between $4.4 million and $12.2 million. By comparison, when Klain became Bidenâs chief of staff in 2009, disclosure reports showed him owning between $1.4 million and $3.5 million in assets.Â 
PSAKI DEFENDS WH CHIEF KLAIN'S âTONE DEAF INFLATION TWEETâ
Most notably, Klain received a salary of nearly $2 million last year from Revolution LLC, an investment firm started by AOL co-founder Steve Case where Klain was executive vice president and general counsel.Â

If thereâs one person who knows 
about "high-class problems," itâs Ron Klain

Border Patrol
 agents said Tuesday they found two little sisters, ages 4 and 6, wandering alone just south of theÂ Morelos Dam at the U.S.-Mexico border.
The location is commonly used as a crossing point for unaccompanied migrant children, according to U.S. Border Patrol Yuma Sector. An agent working in the areaÂ spotted the sisters and escorted them to safety, according to the 
Facebook
 post.

      U.S. Border Patrol released this photo after two girls were found wandering alone.

Â 
The girls were carrying a note with contact information for their "tia" and were taken into custody.
Attempts will be made to reunite the girls with their family, Border Patrol said.Â Â 
Along with facing challenges finding unaccompanied migrant children, Border Patrol agents have faced other difficulties as thousands of migrants attempt to cross the southern border.Â Â

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration reported that the seizures of fentanyl and meth have increased along with southwest border, as previously reported by 
Fox News.
Fox News contributor and investigative reporter Sara Carter 
reported
 on "Hannity" that many migrant women have been forced into the sex trade by human traffickers at the southern border.Â

She 
explained
 in the interview that children as young as 8 years old are being sold into prostitution.Â 
"Across the globe, more than 25 million people are subjected to human trafficking and slavery. In the United States, it's tens of thousands," she said. "When you think about the number of people coming across the border and flooding into our cities, those that we don't even know â¦ even those that have been apprehended. Women and children who are being released and Border Patrol agents â¦ I've reported on this in the past, have said we release them and we don't even know if these are their real families."Â

Several 
congressmen
, including members of both political parties, were denied access to 
Afghan
 refugees at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, Republican California Rep. Darrell Issa told Fox News.Â 
Issa told Fox News in a Thursday phone call that he is "frustrated that the administration decided to deny us oversight of the remaining refugees here or any real access to these centers."Â 
Issa's office said they began outreach to U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) and the U.S. Embassy in Qatar for the trip back in September, but only found out this week that they would be denied access to the refugees.Â 
"Nobody said that there would be a problem with DOD until after we were here and then they started talking about how they were in the final stages and didn't have the resources, basically they didn't want us to meet with refugees and hear their stories," Issa said.Â 
STATE DEPT TRYING TO STEAL CREDIT FOR RESCUE OF 4 AMERICANS FROM AFGHANISTAN, ORGANIZER SAYS: âTOTAL LIEâÂ 
The congressman said his fellow Californian, Democratic Rep. Lou Correa, was among those in attendance.Â 
"There are tens of thousands of Afghans brought in this country, that the administration flew here, and they have no idea who they are. Now, they are holding refugee camp on an American military base, and they don't want us to know who they are," an Issa staffer told Fox News.Â

Republicans have raised serious concerns in recent weeks about the 
Biden administration's
 vetting of Afghan refugees. Those concerns have only intensified after 
two Afghan men were arrested
, one for sex crimes with a minor and the other for domestic abuse.Â 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas revealed last month that 
only 3%
 of the over 60,000 Afghan evacuees brought to the United States following the end of the war in Afghanistan have been special immigrant visa recipients.
"Approximately 6 percent have been lawful permanent residents. Approximately 3 percent have been individuals who are in receipt of the special immigrant visas," Mayorkas said during congressional testimony at the time.
A CENTCOM spokesman didn't return Fox News' request for comment by press time.Â 
Fox News' Michael Lee contributed reporting.

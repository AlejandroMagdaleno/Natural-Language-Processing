\subsection{Constituency Parsing}
When you are Constituency parsing a sentence or a corpus you are breaking it down into constituents\footnote{In linguistics this is a word or construction that is part of a larger construction.}.
Deals mainly with the \emph{syntax} of the given sentence or corpus.
\subsection{Dependency Parsing}
When you are dependency parsing you are deriving than \emph{semantic} relationships rather than the \emph{syntax}
This is done by finding what words are dependent on which words creating binary relationships between words.
